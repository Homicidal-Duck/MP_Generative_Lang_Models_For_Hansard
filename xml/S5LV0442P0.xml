<title>Extradition: Legislation and Treaties</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00241"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00242">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00243">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether in the interests of the suppression of international crime they will consider the consolidation of the extradition statutes, and the conclusion of treaties to establish or re-establish effective extradition relations where they have lapsed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00244"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the law and practice of extradition were reviewed by an Inter-Departmental Working Party, whose report was published in May 1982. The report was sent for comment to individuals and organisations known to have an interest in the subject, and we are considering their responses before deciding what action to take on the recommendations of the working party. It has not been the practice to negotiate or re-negotiate our extradition treaties while decisions on the review of the Extradition Act are pending.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00245"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I thank my noble friend the Minister for that most helpful reply, may I ask him whether there is not a case for a reform and consolidation of our own statutes prior to accession to the European Extradition Convention such as is recommended in the Inter-departmental Committee's report; whether accession to the
<col>2</col>
convention, as recommended, without having first taken these steps would not add a layer of undue complexity; and whether in any event the conclusion of new treaties to establish effective extradition arrangements, which take some time, is not a matter of concern?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00246"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is right. We have to get these things in the right order. Accession to the convention would require more than consolidation of the existing statutes. If the number of designations were to be small enough to make it worth our while to sign, we should at least have to remove the requirement for proof of a <i>prima facie</i> case before extradition can be granted. This is a point which was covered in the report and attracted during the period for consultation many comments which are now being considered. The coming into force of new legislation substantively different from the present would mean the renegotiation of all our existing treaties, and that would take a very long time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00247"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that, until we have signed the European Extradition Convention and negotiated the bilateral agreements that would be necessary, our law will remain out of date and out of step with those of other friendly countries? Will the Government, therefore, do their best to make really good progress in this matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00248"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think this really is a matter for making haste slowly. It is a complicated field. We are not under grave pressure from the discontinuity, to which my noble friend refers, between our law and that of other countries. To bring the whole into harmony would take a very long time indeed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00249"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is the case, is it not, that this country has a notable record of achievement in the extradition field, first having pioneered its introduction in a great many ways? Have we not a lot to teach other countries in this field?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00250"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, including thoroughness and patience.</membercontribution></p>

<title>London's Homeless: Rowton Hostels</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00251">2.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00252"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00253">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00254">To ask Her Majesty's Government what steps are being taken to alleviate the growing problem of London's homeless; and what arrangements are being made to deal with the threatened closures of the Rowton hostels.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00255"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are well aware of the problems of London's homeless and have under way a major programme for the provision of modern hostels: funds are being made available specifically for this purpose through the Housing Corporation. The future of the hostels in London owned by Rowton Hotels PLC is primarily a matter between the company and the local authorities concerned&#x2014;the London Boroughs of Camden, Lambeth and Tower Hamlets, and the Greater London Council. An independent valuer has been appointed by those councils and the company jointly, to determine the value of the hostels. Negotiations are at a delicate stage, and I am sure the House would not wish me to prejudice them by saying more about the Rowton hostels at this juncture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00256"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate what the noble Lord the Minister has said about the negotiations. But will he explain why the negotiations are only between the local authorities and Rowton Hotels? Surely we have to recognise that this is a national problem. Is it not most unfair to leave it to the local authorities? Can the noble Lord the Minister say what is the Government's estimate of the figures of homeless single men sleeping rough in London tonight? Did he see an estimate in the evening <i>Standard</i> some days ago of 50,000? Is not that a disgrace to a capital city?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00257"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. Although I appreciate the concern on all sides of the House on the future of the Rowton hostels, I cannot agree that this is a national problem. After all, they are situated in local authorities' areas. Local authorities have responsibility for the housing of people in special need. The negotiations are being conducted between the local authorities' concerned and Rowton Hotels PLC. So far as the Government's estimate is concerned, I am afraid that I have no figures on the number of people who will be sleeping out rough tonight, but I have no doubt that the figure of 50,000 people mentioned in the recent <i>Standard</i> article has some basis of truth in it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00258"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the noble Lord the Minister read an article this morning in one of the newspapers which supports Her Majesty's Government&#x2014;namely, the <i>Daily Express</i>&#x2014;complaining about the existence of a vast number of empty houses in the London area which could be used for the purpose of allowing homeless people to occupy them if the local authorities were advised accordingly and were allowed to spend the money required? Is it not a
<col>4</col>
scandal that in this country, where we talk about civilisation and about progress, we should have thousands of homeless people sleeping rough on the Embankment, and in other places?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00259"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as regards empty houses, this is again a matter for local authorities. I have noticed that there are various places thoughout the country where local authorities are not using the money provided for them by Government, and through their own rating system, for the occupation of those houses. That is an absolute scandal when the money is available.<lb/>
As regards people sleeping rough, it is not always the fact that they are sleeping rough because they are unable to find houses. Information is beginning to come to light that there are some people, commonly called tramps, who actually prefer that way of life, as much as that might seem disagreeable to either myself or others of your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00260"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend the Minister aware of the situation in Bruce House, a common lodging house in the City of Westminster, where the council, although it had for years spent more and more money on upgrading it, was faced with such unreasonable demands from the socialist opposition that all the former occupants of that place had to be put out? Moreover, is the noble Lord aware that the regional authority, which is socialist controlled, would not agree to any rebuilding or improvements which would bring the house back into use and help homeless people?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00261"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of the case that my noble friend brings to your Lordships' attention. However, if her facts are correct&#x2014;and I have no means of either proving or disproving them&#x2014;this is another scandal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00262"><member>Lord Soper</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are the Government aware that during the past few days a document has been published by a group called UNLEASH, sponsored by the Church of England authorities, which indicates that on any ordinary night in London there are at least 5,000 single homeless people, very few of whom, I imagine, prefer that to some kind of domiciliary comfort? Will the Government take account of the propositions made in that document for a closer relationship between Government authority in general and local authorites, who would be only too glad to have the opportunity to do better if they had more money with which to do it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00263"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have already made the point that the money is available. As regards the report to which the noble Lord, Lord Soper, refers, this has been published only in the last few days. The Government are considering it very carefully, and will report in due course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00264"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend not agree that one side of the problem concerning thousands of homeless people in this city and elsewhere is that, for a section of them, anyhow, the problem of alcohol is almost intractable?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0011"/>
<col>5</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00265"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; and this puts them in a special category of homelessness for which local authorities are bound to find beds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00266"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that in the London borough of Westminster, which is Tory controlled, there are over &#x00A3;50 million worth of vacant dwellings at the moment? On the question of Rowton houses, does he not agree that the Department of Health and Social Security, as has been said in answer to a previous question, has a residual responsibility for looking after the accommodation of many of the people who would be thrown on to the streets if these properties were closed? Does the Minister also agree that it is possible that the Government may be asked to approve a compulsory purchase order on the properties, and that if they were prepared to express their willingness to do this it might concentrate the minds of those on the other side who are negotiating?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00267"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that I made it clear in my original Answer that, as regards the Rowton hostels, anything is possible, and I do not want to do anything which would prejudice the outcome of talks which are now going on. As regards whether or not Westminster Council have vast amounts of empty properties, I simply do not know the answer. If they have, there are normally very good and very valid reasons why some houses are vacant; in other words, when they are being repaired or rebuilt, when there is a change of occupancy, and other such reasons. It is not all black on the housing scene.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00268"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I refer back to the first part of my noble friend's Question, about the growing problem of London's homeless? In the Minister's reply, did he not say that the Government are undertaking something and that it would be through the voluntary housing movement? I may not have quoted his exact words. May we be informed at what speed this is being taken by the Government? Can the Minister give an estimate of the number of London's homeless, what sort of provision is to be made and how many units will come out of it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00269"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not mention the voluntary bodies in this connection. I have already said that I have no estimates of homelessness in London in any of the various categories. However, to pad out my original Answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, in 1983&#x2013;84 the Housing Corporation has made a specific allocation for association hostel housing and shared housing schemes of over &#x00A3;57 million. Something like a third of this sum will be available for schemes in the London area. Under this Government, the Housing Corporation had up to the end of March 1983 approved schemes providing 7,000 bed spaces, over two-thirds of which are for single homeless people, including the elderly. The number of bed spaces approved in the last financial year was three times greater than in 1978/79.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00270"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that this has developed into a most grave problem which goes beyond the Rowton Houses and the question of alcoholics, tramps or vagrants and
<col>6</col>
involves a very large number of young people? In the light of the exchanges which have taken place, would he not press his right honourable friend to institute a full inquiry into the causes of this problem before it develops into a national difficulty of a size we cannot at present comprehend?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00271"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord the Leader of the Opposition has put his finger squarely on the point, which is that this is a growing problem in our great cities. It does not apply only to London; it also applies to Birmingham, Manchester and, to a lesser extent, cities in the North-East of the country. One of the difficulties is that young people particularly are not made aware (which I feel that they should be through the school system) that the streets of our great cities are not paved with gold.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00272"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister what advice is given to school-leavers on the danger of the big cities, so that they do not come to London and other big cities without having prearranged accommodation, because many of them do come from the country and some even come from Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00273"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the greatest respect, I think that that question is rather wide of the original Question on the Order Paper, even though I did widen my last answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00274"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister has said that a number of local authorities are not using the grants. Could he publish in the <i>Official Report</i> a list of the local authorities which are using the grants and those which are not? It would be very interesting for the local elections in three days' time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00275"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord referring to empty houses generally or is he referring to the use of them by homeless people?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00276"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend the Minister whether he can confirm that, due to the Government's order recently, those young people who are out of work and who also have no home to go to can in the future give a hostel as their home address, bearing in mind that a person cannot get a job unless they have a home address? Can the Minister tell me if that is now the case and, if it is, for how long each young person would have to be in a hostel before that address may be used as a home address?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00277"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so far as employment and registering for unemployment goes, I am afraid that I cannot answer my noble friend. But I can tell her that since 1st April this year the rules for claiming benefits have been amended to make it clear that people resident for 14 days or longer in such places are entitled to housing benefits. It would be logical to assume that the same rules would apply to unemployment benefit.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Asylum: Pakistani Applications</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00278">2.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00279"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government on what date the person whose Home Office reference is K310933/5 was first interviewed in connection with his application for asylum: why no decision has yet been made; and what are the factors being taken into consideration regarding the human rights situation in Pakistan when evaluating claims for asylum from citizens of that country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00280"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the subject of Home Office file K310933 was interviewed on 8th June 1981 in connection with his application for asylum in the United Kingdom. All relevant factors are taken into account when considering a claim for asylum and, although all applications are considered case by case in the light of their individual circumstances, there are occasions when a group of applications must be considered together. Several Pakistanis of the same persuasion as the subject of the noble Lord's Question have applied for asylum here, and I hope that we will be in a position to resolve these applications in the very near future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00281"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the initial interview with this person took place in April 1981 and not in June, as he has just said? Is it not scandalous that it should take more than two years to process an application for asylum from whatever country the person may come, bearing in mind that he has all the disadvantages of an unsettled status in that he cannot look for a job, settle down or begin to make a new life in any other way? Will the noble Lord kindly deal with the third part of my Question? What factors are being taken into consideration regarding the human rights situation in Pakistan in evaluating these claims for asylum? I ask this bearing in mind that in Pakistan recently laws have been promulgated which increase the so-called Islamic penalties, which make the evidence of a woman equivalent to half that of a man and which have excited the wrath of the bar associations up and down the country, leading to the detention of many distinguished lawyers and politicians? Are these factors taken into account in looking at the claims for asylum of people from that country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00282"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the interview&#x2014;which is what the noble Lord asked me about&#x2014;was on 8th June, according to the advice I am given. As to the disadvantages of being the subject of an unresolved claim to asylum, I should point out that the individual in question is at liberty and is not held in custody, in case any of your Lordships should be under a misapprehension about that. The considerations which my honourable friend has in mind when resolving these issues extend to a list longer than that of the subordinate clauses with which the noble Lord furnished his third supplementary question. In this case, the circumstances of his release from imprisonment in Pakistan, which resulted from the hijacking of a civil aircraft in the course of which one
<col>8</col>
passenger was murdered, mean that his is a case of particular delicacy which must be scrutinised with very great care.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00283"><member>Lord Belhaven and Stenton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the fact that Pakistan has taken in something like 1&#x00BD; million refugees from Afghanistan influence Her Majesty's Government's view on the stand for human rights in Pakistan?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00284"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the principal consideration which subsumes all others is that of Article 1 of the United Nations Convention of 1951 relating to the status of refugees and whether or not an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution on various grounds, including that of, in this case, political opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00285"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister agree that there is no question of the people whose freedom was secured by the hijack to which he refers having been in any way concerned with the commission of that terrorist offence, and that this is proved by the fact that the Home Office has granted asylum to other persons who were also liberated as a result of that hijack? Is it not because we like to keep in the good books of General Zia that we are making life so difficult for these particular applicants? Is not the attitude of the United Kingdom to violations of human rights generally across the world conditioned by the stance of the Government concerned in the struggle between the super-powers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00286"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is right that, I think, three members of this group have in fact received clearance. He is wrong in the assumption that every case is equally simple to resolve. I can however tell him that we hope to resolve the remaining cases very soon.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Arts Council: "Panorama" Programme</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00287">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00288"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.<lb/>
The Question was as follows:<lb/>
To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will invite the BBC to explain why a "Panorama" programme critical of the Arts Council which was completed last year has never been transmitted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00289"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, under the broadcasting arrangements which have been endorsed by successive Governments, the British Broadcasting Corporation is entirely responsible for deciding what programmes to broadcast, subject to the law and to its obligations on programme standards. The Government do not answer for the corporation's programme decisions; nor would it be appropriate for us to intervene with it in respect of particular decisions, such as its decision not to transmit the programme about the Arts Council to which the Question relates. In other words, my Lords, No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00290"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord may perhaps be surprised to hear that in general I
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0013"/>
<col>9</col>
entirely agree with the tenor of his Answer. Is he aware that I believe that it is appropriate that such an arrangement should be made in general terms? But is he also aware that it is to be hoped that the Arts Council will take some note of these exchanges in this Chamber and will recognise that, during the course of the time while this programme was being made, the then Vice-Chairman of the BBC became Chairman of the Arts Council? The coincidence that, after that, the programme was never broadcast has caused some comment.<lb/>
May I also ask the noble Lord whether he is further aware that, contrary to Arts Council statements, a higher proportion of its funds was spent in London, as distinct from other parts of the country, in 1981 than was the case in 1976, when, by another coincidence, I had some responsibility in the matter? In view of this, is it not to be hoped that the BBC will take note of these exchanges and may feel moved to make its own statement on the matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00291"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord began his supplementary question by hoping that the Arts Council would consider the exchanges in the Chamber this afternoon, and he concluded by hoping that the British Broadcasting Corporation would so do. I am sure that <i>Hansard</i> is freely available to them. I cannot comment further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00292"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that in his original reply he said that there were placed on the BBC two obligations: to keep programmes within the law, and to maintain programme standards? Is there not a third obligation: to keep a balance in programmes? Is it not notorious that the "Panorama" team has singularly failed to keep a balance, their programmes usually being Left-wing and highly anti-American in concept?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00293"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, balance is one of the standards which we expect to be kept. If, at the inducement of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, the BBC reads <i>Hansard,</i> it will also read my noble friend's forthright, and not groundless, remarks, and perhaps consider whether a balance was kept in the case of the programmes to which he refers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00294"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it not be judicious to compliment the BBC on not inflicting upon viewers, and those associated with entertainment, another commentary of the type which, when one has to listen to it, one discovers is nothing in particular?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00295"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since in this case the programme was not broadcast, I cannot say whether or not the content was nothing in particular.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00296"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following on what my noble friend Lord Jenkins of Putney has said about the Arts Council, may I ask the noble Lord whether he is aware that we warmly welcome the appointment of the young, new director general, and that we hope he will do much to revitalise that body?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00297"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the occasions on which I can welcome a noble Lord going beyond the Question on the Order Paper are rare, but this is one of them.</membercontribution></p>
<col>10</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00298"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may make a final point on this matter, may I ask the noble Lord whether he is aware that balance is something which is often in the eye of the beholder?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Energy Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00301">3.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00302">Report received.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00303">Clause 7 [<i>Charges for purchases by Electricity Boards</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00304"><member>Lord Ezra</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 4, line 34 leave out ("other than the Central Electricity Generating Board").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00305">The noble Lord said: My Lords, in the unavoidable absence of my noble friend Lord Tanlaw, I beg to move Amendment No. 1. The amendment proposes that the words,
<quote>"other than the Central Electricity Generating Board",</quote>
should be omitted from Clause 7 of the Bill. The reason for putting forward this amendment (which was also put forward at the Committee stage) is because we consider that if the object of the clause is to introduce transparency in regard to the basis on which the electricity authorities purchase electricity produced by other bodies, there should be total transparency. We see no reason why the electricity boards, which undoubtedly will be purchasing the bulk of the electricity privately or otherwise generated, should have to prepare their tariffs, while the CEGB, which, on the noble Earl the Minister's own admission, might occasionally have to purchase such electricity, should be exempt from this obligation. The noble Earl stated that in the circumstances in which the CEGB had to purchase electricity which was privately or otherwise generated, it would itself fix the terms on which it might be purchased. But if that were to be the policy, why does it not apply throughout?</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00306">What we are complaining about from these Benches is that there seem to be two systems. The electricity boards have to publish tariffs so that the prices are transparent and known to everybody, but the CEGB, which on occasion might have to purchase privately or otherwise generated electricity, can apparently negotiate terms which it considers desirable. In my opinion, based on my experience, it is possible that the amount of electricity which the CEGB might have to purchase will grow. If there are organisations which generate electricity throughout the country, due to the fact that they have branches in various parts of the country, I see no reason why they should not be in a position to negotiate centrally for the sale of that electricity.</p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0014"/>
<col>11</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00307">On these Benches we understand that the Government believe in the market philosophy, which implies the exercise of options by those who want to dispose of a product, and we believe that this philosophy should be carried through in this clause. I therefore wish very strongly to press the amendment, under which it is proposed that there should be introduced into the Bill total transparency in regard to the terms on which electricity should be purchased by either boards or the CEGB. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00308"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy (The Earl of Avon)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry that my earlier reply on the amendment during the Committee stage has failed to satisfy both the noble Lords, Lord Tanlaw and Lord Ezra. In that reply I explained the main reason for exempting the CEGB from Clause 7. It is that there is little point in asking the CEGB to fix a purchase tariff which is unlikely to be used. Virtually every private generator will be dealing with an area board. Selling direct to the CEGB would be a specific case, and the terms would need to be individually negotiated; and at one stage the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, himself used the term "centrally negotiated". If I were to give an example, I would refer to tidal power or something of that kind, which would need a very specific, and a negotiated, settlement outside the tariffs that we are discussing.<lb/>
I am aware of the noble Lord's concern that the bulk supply tariff should not be used as the yardstick for purchasing supplies from private generators. There is of course no mention of the BST in the Bill. If someone approached the CEGB wishing to sell significant amounts of electricity on a regular basis, the two parties would establish an operating regime which might involve the private station becoming integrated in the CEGB's system and accepting operational control like any other CEGB station. In these circumstances the bulk supply tariff would almost certainly be an inappropriate measure of the station's contribution to electricity supply, particularly, for example, at times of peak demand. In contrast, for a small and less predictable producer supplying an area board, the BST, as the reference point, might be as generous at certain times as it is ungenerous at others, and thereby it would reflect on average the value of the producer's output.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said that the CEGB would not be exempted. I feel that I must emphasise that where the CEGB proposes a price to a private generator, that price must conform with the same fair terms embodied in the Bill for purchases by other boards, including the principle that it must reflect the board's avoided costs. The price proposed by the CEGB is also subject, as are prices proposed by other boards, to the disputes procedure in the Bill under Clause 9. The CEGB would therefore not have complete discretion over the price offered to the private generator.<lb/>
The Government are satisfied that the private generators will not be at a disadvantage because the CEGB is exempt from setting tariffs. The exemption is a practical one arising from the recognition that the CEGB will rarely be called upon to purchase privately generated electricity. On that rare occasion, special
<col>12</col>
circumstances are likely to arise. I hope that, in the light of this further explanation, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, will feel able not to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00309"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have all listened with great care to what the noble Earl, the Minister, has said. I still feel that it would have been desirable for the CEGB to publish its tariffs and then negotiate around those tariffs in the normal negotiating manner. However, if he has given us the assurance that any negotiation conducted by the CEGB will take full account of the terms on which electricity boards negotiate and that it will not, as a result of its central position, discriminate in any way against those negotiating with it, I am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00310">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00311"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member> moved Amendment No 2:
<quote>After Clause 10 insert the following new clause:</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00312" align="center"><i>("Waste disposal authorities</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00313">(".&#x2014;(1) This section applies to the production and use of electricity in accordance with section 21(3) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (production of heat and electricity from waste, etc).</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00314">(2) Where a disposal authority wishes to use any such electricity on premises occupied by the authority other than the installation at which it was produced and requests an Electricity Board to permit the authority to use the Board's transmission and distribution system for the purpose of supplying the electricity to those premises the Board shall offer to comply with the request unless on technical grounds it would not be reasonably practicable to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00315">(3) Where a disposal authority produces electricity in accordance with the said section of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, it shall be the duty of that authority, wherever practicable, to adopt and support schemes&#x2014;

<li>(<i>b</i>) for the use of heat produced in combination with electricity, or incidentally from its generation, for the heating of buildings or for other useful purposes.</li>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00319">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I move this amendment in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Tanlaw and Lord Ezra, the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, and myself. It is a repeat of the amendment put down in Committee which we have felt bound to table again. In the interval, there has been some discussion and correspondence with the noble Earl&#x2014;we thank him for his courtesy in outlining the Government's attitude and for looking into the matter&#x2014;but we do not feel that what he says is sufficiently reassuring. We have therefore felt bound to return to the matter again.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00320">It is clear that the main purpose of the Bill is to encourage generation of electricity by private enterprise, in part as a spur to greater efficiency in the public sector electricity supply industry. However, it is also clear that, for some reason that is not evident, the Government believe that the present Bill need not, and should not, increase the powers and responsibilities of local authorities in the field of transmission.</p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0015"/>
<col>13</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00321">At present, only the Greater London Council is directly generating electricity from waste. There is however much enthusiasm, which should be welcomed and encouraged, among local authorities wishing to contribute in every possible way to the principle of energy conservation. With the price of energy increasing at a far greater rate than prices generally, it can only be a matter of time before waste disposal authorities decide that it would be economic for them to manufacture electricity for their own consumption.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00322">Authorities will not take kindly to manufacturing electricity from waste, selling it to electricity boards at a predetermined price and then being forced by the boards to buy the same product at a higher price for their own consumption. In our view, the Government should not be supporting the principle of one part of the public sector making a profit from another. Such a course can surely only lead to unproductive bureaucracy. We know how much the Government are against that&#x2014;as, indeed, are all of us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00323">It seems strange that the Government, with their commitment to energy conservation, should be opposing on ideological grounds a proposal which, although it may not be put into practice in the immediate future, will undoubtedly in the long run make a worthwhile contribution towards the energy resources of this country. When the Government talk about encouraging the generation of electricity by private enterprise, they seem to mean different things at different times, as the mood takes them. I should have thought that private enterprise would mean any enterprise that was not part of the nationalised electricity industry. But this is apparently not so according to the rather myopic manner in which the Government view the matter. As Humpty Dumpty said, "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean: neither more nor less".</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00324">There is no consistency in the Government's attitude except that they are clearly biased against local authority private enterprise. In other words, local authorities are to be treated as a sort of second-class sector, way below private contractors, and are thought not to be worthy of being entrusted with this task. Unless the noble Earl has a better explanation, we shall feel bound to press the matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00325"><member>Lord Balogh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I commend the amendment because it is an improvement on what now exists. However, it does not eliminate the basic foolishness of the Bill. The measure has little to do with energy as such. It has something to so with the regressive redistribution of income and the wrong allocation of resource capacity to the country. Far from improving underlying competitiveness, this will weaken it. A horrifying shrinkage of economic knowledge is plainly displayed. The Administration have forgotten, if they ever knew, that the impact of decreasing cost industry increases the probability of monopolistic worsening of the situation.<lb/>
No one in his right mind would propose measures that would depress the industrial pattern of a decreasing cost and increasing returns industry. Yet this is exactly what is proposed. The Prime Minister, duly echoed by the Energy Secretary, has been crowing about successes. Actually, what has happened is that
<col>14</col>
the decline has been halted by the steadying of the market, and no more. She discerned a brisk advance and the creation of what she calls real jobs. This would&#x2014;she says&#x2014;achieve optimum function of the economy. The words "market forces" flew around like a disturbed swarm of bees. What in fact happened, and will continue to happen, in the short run, if the proposed Bill is effective, is reallocation of resources and certainly not optimum allocation of capital.<lb/>
I well remember the days when I had to change or buy convertors for all my electrical gadgets when I was moving from 44 to 28 Gordon Square because they were supplied by different firms having different preferences. We are certainly at the moment on the way down. We can only hope that this trend will be altered before we are down and out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00326"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, and supported by the noble Lord, Lord Balogh. This is a very moderate amendment and entirely in keeping with the sense of the Bill. We are suggesting here that local authorities which take the initiative to generate electricity by using waste products to greater advantage than has so far been the case should be entitled to negotiate with the electricity authorities to transmit that electricity to other local authority locations. This is what the Bill proposes for private enterprise which takes such an initiative in generating its own electricity. There is no restriction to the generation of electricity on the basis of waste; it can generate it on the basis of any fuel it likes. So this seems to be a discrimination against the initiative which could be shown by local authorities.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Minister, in his comments on this amendment as moved at the Committee stage, said that the effect of this change might be a return to the days when electricity supply was concentrated in local authorities. But we are here talking about a very limited operation requiring a great deal of courage and initiative&#x2014;namely, the generation of electricity from waste. I believe that, in the interests of energy conservation, we should be giving every encouragement to bodies&#x2014;whether they be local authorities or others&#x2014;who are prepared, instead of having to find more and more places in which to dispose of domestic waste, to convert it into usable energy.<lb/>
Therefore, we from these Benches request that the Government think yet again about giving local authorities the same degree of incentive for the promotion of energy efficiency as is provided in this Bill for private enterprise, bearing in mind that we are here talking about converting waste to a useful resource, bearing in mind that it will be a very limited amount of electricity that will be generated from this source for a long time to come, and bearing in mind that all we are asking for is that local authorities should have the ability to negotiate with the electricity generating authorities about the disposal of this electricity to other locations within their control.<lb/>
We believe that this is a very moderate proposition&#x2014;entirely in line with the sentiment of this noble House&#x2014;for generating electricity in the most efficient way and for giving every conceivable encouragement to energy efficiency. Therefore, I should like to press very strongly that the Government concede this point in those interests.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0016"/>
<col>15</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00327"><member>Viscount Hanworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support the amendment from these Benches. The points which are really important have just been made by the last speaker. There is a move, of course, to try to use refuse for producing power, and it really needs a bit more incentive to make it a practical realisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00328"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to oppose the amendment, The sentiments that have been put forward sound very impressive and very environmentally conscious but they fail to appreciate exactly the environmental situation at the vast waste disposal station at Edmonton which is now the place from which the Greater London Council generates its electricity from waste. In order to produce sufficient refuse to incinerate to produce enough electricity, there has to be an enterprise of vast size. From the local environmental point of view, it brings in great numbers of heavy and noisy vehicles which have to queue up in order to tip their waste into the great bays that are provided. Anyone living in the Edmonton area&#x2014;and I must say that I represent a seat not far from there on the Greater London Council&#x2014;is rather grateful to hear that the Greater London Council considers that the cost of producing the electricity and of running the station means that probably nothing of its type will ever be constructed again.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, has said, it is likely that only a small number of people would want to produce electricity from waste in the future. Certainly at Edmonton the cost of production has been found to be great. However, it has simply been a waste product and, therefore, it has been used and people are pleased that is has been used. It has always been sold through the electricity grid. In the past the problem has been the price that was paid for it. Because the electricity boards are the monopoly controllers of the power system, the power that was generated was purchased at a very, very low price. The Minister has now assured us that that will not be the case and that the Bill will ensure that the Greater London Council receives a fair price for its power. Similarly, if these schemes come into operation in other areas&#x2014;as has been suggested by other noble Lords&#x2014;and perhaps on a smaller scale, then again I would think that to get a fair price for the power that is generated would be very adequate.<lb/>
I would deplore local authorities going into the electricity business. I do not think that that is the duty of local authorities. There are specific statutory obligations now placed upon local authorities. They have more than enough responsibilities at present. Indeed, at present they frequently seem to stray into their own, in my opinion, undesirable private enterprise. I certainly would not want to see them going into the electricity generating business. I would most strongly oppose the amendment, and ask your Lordships to do the same.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00329"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to oppose the amendment in spirit but I wonder whether the noble Earl would say in his reply whether there is any provision for generation at the correct voltage; in other words, that it should be AC and not DC? Also can he say whether the electricity so generated will be supplied to the national grid?</membercontribution></p>
<col>16</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00330"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, noble Lords will remember that in Committee I appealed to the Government to have another look at this matter provided that the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, would withdraw his amendment at that stage. Those of us who have been able to be in touch with the department and with my noble friend the Minister in the meantime, are grateful for the care and attention which he has shown in dealing with it.<lb/>
It is a sadness to me that my noble friend Lord Ridley, with his vast local authority experience, cannot be here today, as he could not be present at the Committee stage. By the same token, the contribution of my noble friend Lady Gardner, as a local authority expert, is very timely indeed. As one has looked into the matter&#x2014;and I, too, have thought about it while the Government have had another think&#x2014;the question that arises is whether the local authorities really need the right to their own transmission systems to their own premises.<lb/>
We already have it from the noble Lord, Lord Ezra&#x2014;whose presence here is so welcome to all of us who are interested in energy, and whose contributions are of such interest&#x2014;that it is likely to be a very limited operation in any event. I am rather surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, in his ideologically myopic approach to private enterprise did not cite a whole lot of examples of local authorities that actually want this to take place. We do not know how many of them want it. We do not know at all and no one has given us any indication of how many extra refuse generators could be expected to result from the local authorities being given the transmission rights. We do not know what extra kilolwattage of energy is in view. Surely the big incentive has already been provided in the Bill, which is to enable local authorities to sell at a fair price. That is the new provision; that is what is being offered to private enterprise, that is what is being offered to local authorities; and that is really the ultimate incentive.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, said that, as matters were, local authorities would have to buy the electricity back from the boards at a higher price than that at which they sell it. I do not know whether that is so or not: it is a new slant. But surely it is equally fair to suggest that if local authorities have to provide their own transmission system in parallel with that already existing in the grid, it can only raise the cost and would be a needless duplication. So whether local authorities having access to a transmission system of their own would lead to a cheaper product is certainly questionable and one is surprised that the movers of this amendment have not adduced any evidence in support of it. It would certainly mean some extra capital expenditure. The electricity boards&#x2014;monopolists that they are and no friends of mine on that account&#x2014;are supposed to be the experts. The idea now is that local authorities would be just as expert, no doubt by taking on extra staff at public expense.<lb/>
But I think that one has to see this in proportion. This is not a local authority Bill. It is essentially an electricity Bill enabling non-board producers to sell at a fair price. That applies equally to the pure private enterprise or the kind of surrogate private enterprise which now enters the ideology of the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi. The critical aspect is the incentive of fair
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0017"/>
<col>17</col>
price, which is new. Surely anything more than that will widen the local authorities' powers in a sense that would hardly be appropriate to the purposes of this Bill.<lb/>
I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, that it makes competition wider still. Indeed, that is the argument that I used in Committee. But having looked at the matter further, I am not sure that that is other than a collection of words. The real point is whether this is a Bill about local authorities or whether it is a Bill about electricity. Because it is an electricity Bill&#x2014;an energy Bill&#x2014;I do not think that one should seize this opportunity to widen the powers of local authorities to a degree that may in any case be counter-productive and would only arise (so we are told) on a very small scale.<lb/>
This would of course tend to turn the clock hack towards localised generation of electricity, and although I would not oppose that in itself, it comes strangely from noble Lords opposite, with their love of centralisation, to argue that case. I believe that the real question is whether this is an appropriate amendment for this Bill at this time. I should like to suggest that I do not think it is&#x2014;I do not think it is any longer. Therefore, I hope that noble Lords will not press it. I should like to express my thanks and that of others to my noble friend Lord Avon for the care and attention which he has given to the matter meantime.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00331"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as always, I was impressed by the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra; but he made the point about the opportunity for local authorities to exercise initiative. As I read the amendment, it is not about initiative; it is about the production of electricity. I should have thought that local authorities should be encouraged to use their initiative if this is a good way of disposing of their waste. But it is good that, having taken the initiative, they should go to a private enterprise, which inevitably and always looks carefully at whether the particular operation will be cost-effective, because that is what they are in business for and they go out of business if they are not cost-effective. They will get a much better deal from somebody who tackles this problem properly for, as my noble friend Lord Lauderdale has said, because local authorities do not really have the same type of disciplines for balancing their books as does private enterprise, there is a tendency for them to embark on projects that perhaps are not profitable. This would be bad because the whole exercise would be a disaster&#x2014;as indeed my noble friend Lady Gardner has indicated is the case as regards the Edmonton exercise of the same sort.<lb/>
I should have thought that the principle of what the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is seeking&#x2014;which is to allow local authorities to have initiative in this area&#x2014;is in no way harmed by the Bill as it stands, and in fact might produce a rather bogus and non-cost effective result if this amendment were passed. Therefore I suggest to him that the amendment goes much further than he is mainly seeking.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00332"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been suggested from the other side that the powers of local authorities would have to be widened. My experience tells me that over 70 years ago refuse disposal departments were either generating electricity themselves and feeding it
<col>18</col>
into the main or else selling steam from the burning of the refuse to the neighbouring electricity generating authority. I know this very well because about 70 years ago I was the chief cost accountant of the Birmingham Corporation refuse disposal department, and we took great pride in the way in which we were making money and saving money for the ratepayers by burning their refuse instead of transporting it miles out into the country to tip it, and then securing an income from the electricity authorities from the steam which we supplied to them.<lb/>
The cost of alternative methods of dealing with refuse is very expensive. For example, there is tipping. If you are in the middle of a big city, your tipping opportunities are limited to the country districts which are perhaps 10 miles away, and you have to transport the raw refuse, or the clinker after it has been burned, to country districts well outside the boundaries of the city. You have to use canal boats or motor vehicles to transport it, and both of those forms of transport are very expensive and put a burden on the rates.<lb/>
The burning of refuse also costs money; it is a fairly extensive operation. So there is a way of securing a set-off against the cost of dealing with refuse. Selling the steam from your refuse destructor boilers is one way. We used to do this in Birmingham and we received quite a substantial income from it. We sold the steam to an electricity station a few miles away, and it was of course transported through pipes.<lb/>
I do not think that there is anything to be said against the proposals that are put forward in this amendment. The amendment will give some extra powers to local authorities. Those local authorities who have such powers at the moment are finding them very successful, and I see no reason why it should not be extended to others.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00333"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I gather from the speeches to which I have listened that the Government are opposed to this amendment because they fear that this would turn the clock back, by which is meant that we would return to the period when local authorities generated electricity by using waste products. But they did nothing of the sort; they never did that at any time. It is obvious that those who talk in that strain know nothing about the history of electricity. I intervene only because I confess that I prepared the Bill for the nationalisation of electricity, and long before then&#x2014;way back in the period of the First World War&#x2014;was concerned when, through the medium of the metropolitan gasworks in London, we sought to process coal for the purpose of producing oil and other by-products. That is another story.<lb/>
There is a history about this matter. What was the situation 30, or 40 or 50 years ago? A number of local authorities were responsible for generating electricity, not by using waste products but by generating it from coal, and from no other mineral. That was the situation. It was because of the conflict between those local authorities and private electricity undertakings that it was decided by a Labour Government to nationalise electricity. The first step was taken, not by a Labour Government but I believe by the Baldwin Government in creating the Central Electicity Generating Board. That was the situation. That is the history.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0018"/>
<col>19</col>
I cannot understand why we should object to local authorities using their waste products to generate electricity. I should like to remind noble Lords of what happened in 1946&#x2013;47. I do not like those dates because they remind me of some of my misadventures. There was an occasion when electricity was in short supply. What happened? We discovered that throughout the country there were various industrial undertakings which had the equipment to generate electricity, and we used them. Without them we should never have been able to overcome the crisis which assailed us at the time.<lb/>
Why were we assailed by a crisis? It was not a coal crisis. One has only to search the Cabinet records 30 or 40 years after the event to discover that. It was because of transport. There was plenty of coal at the sidings. We could not get it to the electricity power stations where we required it. That was all. What is the objection to this proposition? Why not use the local authorities? Are we afraid of the local authorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00334"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord give way? We can use it. We are encouraging them to do it. It is only the question of whether they can use the transmission or not. We are encouraging them to use waste, to burn waste to make electricity. It is all in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00335"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do I understand that the Government are afraid of competition? I thought they rather admired competition. Perhaps this is a change. Is this a U-turn? They are troubled about competition? Why should not the local authorities enter into competition even with the Central Electricity Generating Board, or any other electricity undertaking which has the support of the Government? Why should they not enter into competition so long as we get the electricity when we require it?<lb/>
It does not mean that the local authorities will immediately begin to generate electricity if it is not required. There must be a market for it. I am not sure, if I may say so, that the noble Earl, Lord Avon, is intensely interested in this subject. He is working, and I can understand it, on a brief. Have the department never read the history of the electricity industry? Have they never heard of those occasions when electricity was in short supply because of something that went wrong at the electricity undertaking in the winter, or any other time? What is the trouble about it?<lb/>
Of course the Minister is no longer interested. He is not paying the slightest attention to me. I can understand it. Ministers get that way sometimes. They begin to fancy themselves, and why should they take any notice of me or any other Member of your Lordships' House? Anyway, I put the point again: here is a proposition to enable local authorities to use waste products to generate electricity. What is wrong with that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00336"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00337"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: It is in the Bill? Well, why are you objecting to it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00338"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are not objecting to it at all. The noble Lord, Lord Shinwell, is quite right.
<col>20</col>
If he reads the Bill he will find that we are encouraging local authorities to generate electricity which can be bought by the boards.<lb/>
Now may I come back to the Report stage of this Bill. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, made an excellent thesis, and I thought he skated very well on thin ice somewhere between telling us a little on how we ought to privatise, and balancing it a little by the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Balogh, which is basically that the party opposite do not like this Bill very much.<lb/>
For a start, let me make it clear that local authorities already possess adequate powers relating to the generation of electricity and heat. They are able to generate electricity from waste or from other fuels. Since 1974 they have had the right to sell their electricity to electricity boards; a right given to private generators for the first time in the Bill before your Lordships. The problem&#x2014;I think I could even say complaint&#x2014;of local authorities was that the price the boards offered was not of true value. Now the Bill establishes a framework under which the electricity boards will have to offer fair prices for electricity supplied by both local authorities and private generators. Therefore, I believe that this Bill removes the local authorities' major worry.<lb/>
There has been emotive talk of converting waste, energy conservation, initiatives, incentives and efficiency. The noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, mentioned the word "incentive". The Government agree with all these aspects, and we encourage the local authorities to promote electricity through waste generation. The noble Lord, Lord Somers, asked me a couple of questions. The electricity supply sold by local authorities to boards would be at the suitable voltage or frequency and would indeed go on the national grid.<lb/>
Local authorities also have comprehensive powers to participate in combined heat and power schemes. They may produce, acquire and dispose of heat; they may produce electricity and dispose of it to electricity boards on fair terms; they can establish and operate installations; they can construct, lay and maintain heat mains, and they can even break open streets. In practice, the advantage taken so far of these various powers by local authorities has been very limited. Only one authority, the GLC, generates electricity from waste, though it may be that others will be encouraged&#x2014;and the Government hope this will happen&#x2014;to develop schemes in the light of the new provisions in the Bill on fair prices for the sale of electricity.<lb/>
May I give one example of what is going on at the moment, just to encourage the House that things are on the way that they feel they should be. Local authorities have been involved in active discussion with electricity boards and other interested parties on potential developments. We expect them to continue to do so. Indeed, we know of one possible waste burning combined heat and power project on which a board and a local authority are working closely together. The local authorities have of course also played a constructive part in the feasibility programme. In all these local authority involvements with CHP the Bill will remove impediments and provide encouragement.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0019"/>
<col>21</col>
The new clause proposed by the noble Lords would allow a local authority which generates electricity from waste to use an electricity board's transmission and distribution system to transmit this electricity to other premises occupied by the authority. As I have mentioned, the only authority at present in a position to take advantage of any such step is the GLC. I suggest to the House that the present arrangement by which the GLC sells its output to the Eastern Electricity Board is the way forward. This Bill offers them a fair price. My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes has spoken to this effect.<lb/>
The Government believe that it would be wrong at this stage to contemplate extending the powers of local authorities in the way the noble Lords propose. In the first place, there is no case on practical grounds for such an extension of local authority powers. My noble friend Lord Lauderdale mentioned this. The economics of transmission of electricity for use at locations remote from the site of generation seem unlikely to be more favourable for local authorities compared with selling to the electricity boards at a fair price. The viability of CHP schemes depends upon the economics of the distribution of heat, not upon local distribution of electricity.<lb/>
In the second place, the main purpose of the Energy Bill is to encourage generation of electricity by private enterprise, in part as a spur to greater efficiency in the public sector electricity supply industry. In the third place, for all their merits, we do not expect that local authorities, who have little or no experience in the electricity supply business, will enter into this field. The generation of electricity is not a function of local authorities other than as a by-product. The generation of electricity following the Bill will be a trading enterprise in which the private sector can be expected to invest risk capital in the expectation of making profits. We do not believe that local authorities are in this line of business, nor should they be.<lb/>
I would argue that the first priority for local authorities is to run their existing operations with the greatest possible efficiency. The Government have already said in another place, and I willingly repeat it to this House, that it may be necessary in the future to review legislative and organisational arrangements in the context of the development of CHP district heating. This we shall do. The question of use by local authorities of the transmission and distribution system could be looked at again at that time should there be any new arguments or evidence. The Government believe that the present Bill need not, and should not, increase the powers and responsibilities of local authorities. I hope that with the reassurance that I have given, and the reasons that I have stated, I have been able to convince the House that this is so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00339"><member>Lord Balogh</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Minister sits down, may I ask him what is a fair price? Who is going to determine it, and under what principles?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00340"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is Report stage. If I may be able to reply to the noble Lord with the leave of the House, this point is in the Bill, and I think we debated it at Committee stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00341"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think this has been an interesting debate, and I am grateful to all noble Lords
<col>22</col>
who have taken part in it. Of course, this is not a party matter. As your Lordships are aware, this amendment has been supported by noble Lords from all sides of the House. I am sorry we have not had the advantage of the presence of the noble Viscount. Lord Ridley.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, said that he did not know how many local authorities wished to have this power. As has been made clear by the noble Earl, the power is not to generate electricity (a facility which they have now) but to use the electricity board's transmission and distribution system. I can tell the noble Earl that it is wanted by the Association of County Councils, which represents all the local authorities in that sector.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00342"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. My question was not whether the association professes that all its members want it, but how many local authorities are known to want it, which is a different question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00343"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all I can say about the association, from what little experience I have, is that it mirrors the wishes and policy of its members.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, says, this amendment is really to give local authorities some degree of initiative. It is a moderate proposition to encourage energy efficiency. The noble Earl, Lord Avon, and the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, said that they were opposed to local authorities going into the electricity business. Why ever not? This is a Bill to privatise electricity generation and transmission. The Government are taking away the monopoly from the electricity boards. That is accepted by the Bill, which has been passed by another place and is shortly to be passed by your Lordships' House&#x2014;but why discriminate? Once this power is taken away from the electricity boards, why is it then given only to private contractors and not to local authority contractors? We on this side of the House cannot see the difference. Why should there be this bias against local authorities? We think that the House should divide and that we should press this so that your Lordships can come to a decision.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00347">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00348">Clause 12 [<i>Meters to be of approved pattern</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00349">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00350"><member>Lord Ezra</member> moved Amendment No. 3:
<quote>Page 8, line 12 after ("State") insert ("and the Electricity Consumers' Council").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00351">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 3, which proposes that the words, "the Electricity Consumers' Council" should be inserted in this clause. This clause deals with the question of the approval of meters for the measurement of electricity, which is very important for consumers because it is on that basis that they are charged for the electricity that they consume. Therefore, we consider, in the interests of consumers, that the Electricity Consumers' Council should be associated with the approval of these meters. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00352"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the purpose of Clause 12 is to require meters used by a person other than an electricity board to measure the electricity he supplies to another person to be of an approved pattern. This means a design approved by the appropriate United Kingdom or European Community metrological authority. Approval in the United Kingdom is given by the Department of Energy's chief electricity meter examiner on behalf of the Secretary of State.<lb/>
The effect of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, would be that for approval to take effect in this country the meter would also have to be seen by the Electricity Consumers' Council. We all recognise the valuable work on behalf of consumers done by the Consumers' Council&#x2014;which is indeed being given statutory status in later clauses in this Bill. However, pattern evaluation for approval involves a critical examination and testing of meters requiring highly specialised staff and equipment to ensure that meters conform to the requirements of the appropriate British Standard Specification, BS5685. I am sure that the Consumers' Council themselves would accept that they do not possess the competence or apparatus to carry out such technical analysis. Nor am I aware that they are dissatisfied with the chief electricity meter examiner's performance.<lb/>
I am aware of the interest shown by the Electricity Consumers' Council in the introduction of new metering technology involving remote meter reading and load control. One, the mains-borne telecontrol system, which allows for reading and control of electricity, gas and water supplies, has already been given approval for trial purposes, and others will, as they become available, be examined by the chief meter examiner, who keeps in close touch with these developments. The question of their introduction for domestic use is of course a matter for the industry in consultation with consumer interests. Pattern

approval is a separate technical question. I hope that, in the light of this explanation, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00353"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have been closely associated with an energy consumers' council for many years and, as their name suggests, what they like to have done to them is to be consulted. They are not experts in most of the technical fields for which they are being consulted and nor, I suggest, in this particular case, would the Secretary of State himself be an expert in metering. He depends upon technical advice. The purpose of this amendment is that the technical advice should be rendered both to the Secretary of State and to the Consumers' Council and that they should consult together in order to decide what are desirable meters and what are not. I would hope therefore&#x2014;and it is not my intention to press this amendment&#x2014;in withdrawing this amendment, that the Secretary of State would, however, be prepared to consult with the consumers' council in these decisions in order to make sure that there is nothing in their view that might be contrary to his opinion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00354">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00355"><member>Lord Ezra</member> moved Amendment No. 4:
<quote>Page 11, line 28 at end insert ("promote",).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00356">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment relates to the insertion of the word "promote" in Clause 19. This was a matter which was debated at some length at the Committee stage. From these Benches, we should like to ensure that the maximum possible stimulus should be given to the electricity authorities to promote CHP schemes. Indeed&#x2014;and I am quoting from the report of our deliberations at the Committee stage on 19th April&#x2014;the noble Earl the Minister then said that:
<quote>"as drafted, the clause gives electricity boards a clear duty to promote CHP schemes".</quote>
If that is the duty which they are given, then we fail to see why the word "promote" should not be used. If we are serious about this, then we should make it very clear to those who are going to have to apply the legislation that that is the case. If it is the intention that these schemes should be promoted by the electricity boards, then we consider that it is not unreasonable that the word "promote" should figure in the legislation. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00357"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to support this amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. I think that to include the word "promote" greatly strengthens the wording of this particular subsection of the Bill and gives great support to words like "adopt" and "support" which are basically somewhat nebulous and which are not nearly positive enough. Of course, it is very necessary that everything should be done to encourage combined heat and power in future. The other day, when we had the general debate on energy, I had some rather hard words to say about the Government's lack of initiative in this respect and how we were lagging far behind our European partners. I think it would be an indication for the Government to show that they are serious about this if they adopted the words in the noble Lord's amendment. Therefore, I support everything that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, has said.</membercontribution></p>
<col>26</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00358"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, really wants every inch of this one. He rightly said that I had said that this should read exactly as he wants it. I will try to explain once more why we believe the present wording not only includes what he wishes but goes, I think, further. I explained at Committee that the wording of Clause 19 was deliberately chosen in order to give the boards a clear and specific duty to adopt and support schemes for CHP and the use of heat generally.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, stated during Committee that the position of the Government on CHP was unclear. Surely the inclusion of Clause 19 in the Bill is a clear indication of the Government's attitude. The clause gives firm encouragement to this type of project and removes any doubt about the attitude which boards should adopt.<lb/>
The Government have also made a positive commitment to investigate thoroughly the economic potential of CHP district heating and is currently assessing the consultants' report on the economic and practical feasibility of CHP district heating schemes in nine locations.<lb/>
As I said in Committee, I am confident that this clause will encourage the development of CHP schemes and that the amendment of the noble Lord is unnecessary. I must repeat what I said at Committee stage. The boards will be able to carry out schemes themselves or to participate in the schemes of others to adopt and support schemes. If the word "promote" were added to the clause they would then be obliged to promote schemes of other parties acting on their own. I do not believe that it would be practicable to impose such a duty in respect of schemes in which boards have no involvement. I am sorry that I did not make this point clearer at the Committee stage. We are not quibbling at all over what we want: it is just a question of how the Bill should be drafted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00359"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, replies, I wonder whether the Minister can explain what happens if the hoard does not carry out the duty that is imposed upon it. It is such a glib phrase to say, "It shall be the duty". But what happens if boards do not "adopt and support" these schemes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00360"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should be happy to answer the noble Baroness by saying that if there was any question of a price not being agreed, I think the matter would go to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for him to adjudicate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00361"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have heard what the noble Earl the Minister has said. It is quite clear that it is the Government's view that the electricity authority should do everything possible to promote the development of CHP. It still puzzles me somewhat as to why, if that is their intention, they cannot state it in the Bill. However, if the answer is very clear as a result of this discussion and what the noble Earl the Minister previously said&#x2014;namely, that they wanted the authorities to promote this but, for some reason (which is unclear to some of us) do not actually want to say so&#x2014;then I should be very happy to leave matters there. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00364"><member>Lord Ezra</member> moved Amendment No. 5:
<quote>Page 12, line 1 leave out from ("the") to end of line 3 and insert ("minimum financial criteria set by the Secretary of State for this type of investment by an Area Board").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00365">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the proposal here is that we should introduce into Clause 19 the words:
<quote>"minimal financial criteria set by the Secretary of State for this type of investment by an Area Board".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00366">The reason for this amendment is that we believe it is so necessary to encourage these new forms of electricity generation that the criteria pertaining to them on a financial basis may not necessarily be the normal criteria which those authorities apply for their normal schemes. We should therefore like to leave it to the Secretary of State, depending upon the circumstances, to agree with the board concerned what those criteria should be. We consider that this proposed amendment would introduce a degree of flexibility and a degree of incentive, and we hope it will be entirely acceptable to the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00367"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before replying to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, may I say a word to the noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, in answer to her question on Amendment No. 4. I said to her that the Secretary of State would be able to do something; but may I say that in point of fact he could direct the board if it was not doing its statutory duty; and that is how it would be done.<lb/>
If I may now refer to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, it is suggested that special rates of return&#x2014;that is, lower rates of return&#x2014;should be set by the Secretary of State for investment in combined heat and power projects. This follows the line of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, at Committee stage. It proposes that combined heat and power schemes should be singled out for special treatment and that criteria other than financial should be given priority when a board is considering a scheme.<lb/>
The Government's overall approach to nationalised industry investment remains that which was outlined in the previous Administration's own White Paper on the nationalised industries <i>(Cmnd, 7131).</i> The nationalised industries should plan their investment so as to achieve a proper rate of return for the programme as a whole. To do otherwise would be to squander national resources. Within this guideline it is for the industries themselves to judge which individual projects seem most worthwhile, but there would need to be special reasons for a board to invest in a major project of any kind which did not seem likely to make its proper contribution to this overall rate of return. I feel that to say such things to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is rather idiotic because for 13 years he chaired one of these boards himself; but when I came here today I did not know that he would be moving the amendment rather than the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, whom I welcome back in his place.<lb/>
I would not disagree with the noble Lord that combined heat and power schemes could provide social benefits; but I would point out that CHP investment is not the only type of investment in generating plant where social benefits could arise.<lb/>
<col>28</col>
There is therefore no particular reason to use the argument of social benefit to justify a lower rate of return criterion on CHP projects than on other projects undertaken by the boards. Equally, nor is it the case that electricity boards would be able to impose a requirement that CHP schemes should provide higher rates of return than other projects. The Bill clearly states that the boards should treat CHP schemes on the same economic basis as other projects: no more and no less. Electricity boards would be expected to apply the same criteria to proposals of this kind as they apply to other types of investment. "Financial criteria" is specified in the Bill so that it is clear that the boards are not obliged to adopt or support uneconomic schemes which could result in an increased burden on consumers generally. I hope that the House will agree to leave it like this.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00368"><member>Lord Tanlaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in supporting my noble friend Lord Ezra, may I clarify one point to the noble Earl. I do not think we are asking for charity: that is not the point of this amendment. We are not asking for any special or lower rate of return. We are asking for recognition by the generating boards that different criteria are applied to CHP schemes than those which are applied to straight generating schemes. The noble Earl referred to waste. The whole point of a combined heat and power scheme is to prevent the waste of excessive heat going up the chimney into the atmosphere. In terms of efficiency and lack of waste, I should have thought that the recognition of this alone would have meant a different type of criteria in order to judge such a scheme.<lb/>
I would also ask the noble Earl to consider that the capital costs may well be higher in putting in the heating pipes, and so on, in a conurbation. But let us take into account the actual increase in employment that this will involve, and which must in a way save money for the Exchequer, which is having to pay out money on unemployment benefits. We have particularly recommended that these schemes should be considered in areas of high unemployment. Therefore the object of this amendment is not in any way not to recognise the Government's strictures laid down in the Command Paper referred to by the noble Earl, but to recognise different criteria by which those rates of return are to be judged. Because there has not been such a scheme in operation in this country before, it is perhaps rather a nuisance for the Government and the electricity boards to work out these financial critieria.<lb/>
All we are asking is that the Government will look again at this aspect and put forward financial criteria which I feel will hold up perfectly adequately in financial returns and loss of waste to the taxpayer, and which will serve to benefit the taxpayer by offering him a new and cheaper form of heating if he is fortunate enough to live in an area in which a CHP scheme operates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00369"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether, with the leave of the House, I might reply just very briefly to the noble Lord, Lord Tanlaw, as I have not been able to speak to him before today. First, the criteria which he has mentioned are very good and I will certainly draw to the attention of the boards what he has said today, but I do not think that they
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0023"/>
<col>29</col>
necessarily come within the ambit of this amendment. May I, too, repeat something I said earlier to the House when the noble Lord was not here. The Government have already said in another place&#x2014;and I willingly repeat it today&#x2014;that it may be necessary in the future to review legislative and organisational arrangements in the context of the development of combined heat and power district heating, and this we shall do.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00370"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of what the noble Earl the Minister has said, I do not wish to press this amendment. I would only remind the House that we as a country are lagging far behind many continental countries in the application of this type of scheme. Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France and many other continental countries have gone much further ahead than we have, and I believe we have lagged behind because of our ambivalence and uncertainty about these projects. If we want to go ahead with them, there must be a determination and a will so to do. If we remain ambivalent and uncertain we shall find that these other countries will get ahead of us in the efficiency with which they utilise electricity and other forms of energy. With those remarks, I am quite ready to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Social Security and Housing Benefits Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00372">4.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00373"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Social Security and Housing Benefits Bill be now read a second time.<lb/>
The purpose of this short Bill is very simple. It is to change the future basis of up-rating social security benefits each year from a forecasting method to an historic, or actual method. Social security is notorious for the creation of obscure terms of jargon, so before going into detail on the Bill's three clauses, I will, with your Lordships' permission, explain the nature of this change and why we believe it to be both necessary and worthwhile.<lb/>
The Social Security Act 1975 obliges the Secretary of State to review each year the levels of certain weekly benefits to determine whether they have kept their value, having regard to movements in the general level of prices. A similar obligation, but with special provision for housing costs, arises in relation to the needs allowances of housing benefit under the Social Security and Housing Benefits Act 1982.<lb/>
Under the system which Clause 1 of this Bill replaces, the review had to be carried out in the tax year preceding the November up-rating date, and the Secretary of State was obliged to take into account the expected movement of prices from the date of the last up-rating to the date of the next one. Since 1976 this has meant preparing a forecast in the early part of the year of the likely movements in the period from November to November. Usually the only certain figures available at the time of the review have been those covering the first two or three months since the
<col>30</col>
previous November's up-rating. The remaining months have been a forecast based on the best assumptions possible at the time. This method of determining benefit increases came to be known as the "forecast" method.<lb/>
Unfortunately, this method has not worked at all well in the seven years it has been in use. The forecasts have been wrong in five years out of seven. Sometimes the difference has meant a loss to pensioners and other beneficiaries; sometimes it meant a gain. Pensioners were never quite sure where they stood with these arrangements, because once the differences became clear there was usually a period of months before they knew what was to happen. This led to unnecessary worry and uncertainty and it was a haphazard and unsatisfactory way of providing benefit increases for the 20 million or so beneficiaries concerned.<lb/>
We think that the time has come to get rid of a forecasting method which has proved to be unreliable, uncertain and a source of worry, and to replace it with a method based on fact and certainty. We propose to review on the basis of actual, or historic, price movements as late in the year as we can manage, and still ensure that beneficiaries get their increases in time. We propose to have the review in June of each year, and to fix the new rates of benefit by reference to the general movement of prices in 12 months from May to May. There is no ulterior motive in the choice of a May to May reference period or of a June review date. We are simply not able to use any later period without risking late payment of the up-rating increases to millions of beneficiaries. And clearly we do not want to move to an earlier review date and thereby widen further than necessary the gap between the review date and the up-rating date. Pensioners have complained in no uncertain terms about the long interval that arose in recent years between a Budget time announcement of new rates and their implementation in November. We intend to improve on that by cutting to five months the gap between the announcement date and the up-rating.<lb/>
Five months sounds a long time to carry out the administrative work of up-rating benefits. But it is not so long when one considers the size and complexity of the operation. Millions of retirement pensioners and other beneficiaries are paid by means of a book of payable orders produced by the computer and normally covering 20 weeks of payment. The issue of these books must be carefully organised to even out the flow of work, and some books covering the week of the November up-rating start to be issued in late May. We can start the process of up-rating later than this by issuing some beneficiaries with a second book topping up their other payments, but there is a limit to the number of extra books than can be issued in this way.<lb/>
There is the further problem that the department's local offices must deal clerically with the complex task of reassessment and replacement of order books for some 3 million to 4 million supplementary benefit and invalidity pension cases. We have not yet succeeded in finding the means of transferring such work on to machines or the computer. So we cannot begin the process more than a matter of a few days after the end of June without large numbers of beneficiaries being forced to wait for some time after the November up-rating date for their increases. This is the problem that
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0024"/>
<col>31</col>
arose when the last Government tried to up-rate in 17 weeks in 1974 and it is one we are determined to avoid. As our operational strategy develops in the coming years we shall be looking towards the possibility of further shortening the gap between the announcement and the up-rating, but we are some way off that point yet.<lb/>
The main doubts that the Bill has created in the course of discussions in another place are not concerned with the principle of the change to an historic reference period, nor to the choice of the latest possible review date. That is not surprising, because the logic is unassailable. Concern has arisen only at the implications of the change for the 1983 up-rating. This is understandable, because we think the inflation rate in May is likely to be a percentage point or two lower than that in November. But no one should draw any false conclusions from that. Last November pensions and other benefits rose by 2.7 per cent. more than was needed to maintain their values. If we had retained the old method of up-rating we would, as we made clear last autumn, have adjusted to have regard to that unintended over-provision. Had full adjustment been decided upon, if the old method had continued the year's up-rating would have been 3.3 per cent. if a forecast of 6 per cent. was assumed.<lb/>
But the question of adjustment is not now relevant. The Government are changing the method and for very good reasons. With the change to the historic method this year's up-rating will reflect fully the actual movement of prices from May 1982 to May 1983. We do not know what the rise in prices will be as yet, but it may be in the region of 4 per cent. In addition, pensions will retain the full 2.7 per cent. over-provision from the 1982 uprating. No question will arise of adjustments for error; there will be no shortfalls and no overshoots. We are replacing doubt with certainty and unreliability with stability.<lb/>
Our pledge to pensioners was that we would fully protect their pensions against inflation over the lifetime of this Parliament. On the best estimates we have, in the five years from November 1978 to November 1983 pensions will have risen by about 75 per cent. and the retail price index by about 70 per cent. We have more than kept our promise to pensioners, despite facing a severe, world-wide economic recession, and that is no small achievement.<lb/>
So much for the background to the change. I turn briefly now to the details of the Bill's three clauses, though your Lordships may also find it helpful to refer to the notes on clauses which have been made available. Clause 1 amends the present up-rating provisions of Sections 125, 126 and 126A of the Social Security Act 1975, which cover national insurance benefits, attendance allowance and invalid care allowance. The provisions also cover public service pensions. Instead of the statutory review being carried out in the tax year preceding each November up-rating, the amendments defer the review date to June each year, for the reasons that I have explained. This clause will also require future increases to be based on the actual percentage rise in prices in the twelve months to the end of May each year, rather than on a forecast of what might happen between up-rating dates.<lb/>
<col>32</col>
Clause 2 amends Section 29 of the Social Security and Housing Benefits Act 1982, which provides for the annual review of housing benefit needs allowances. The needs allowances are the weekly amounts allowed, in calculating the amount of benefit, for the housing and other needs of housing benefit recipients not on supplementary benefit. I should add that the change will not affect supplementary' benefit claimants on housing benefit. They are automatically eligible for help with all their rent and rates, subject, in some cases, to deductions&#x2014;for example, if they have non-dependants living with them. Clause 2 simply makes the amendments necessary to enable the review of needs allowances to be done on an historic basis, by reference to actual changes in prices and housing costs. The Secretary of State will still have to report to Parliament if he decides, after a review, not to restore any loss in value.<lb/>
Clause 3 relates to the Short Title, commencement and extent of the Bill. It ensures that the Bill's provisions apply for the purposes of the 1983 up-rating review, and it allows Northern Ireland to continue to reflect up-rating increases provided for in Great Britain legislation without the need for special new provisions for Northern Ireland.<lb/>
As I have indicated, not all social security benefits are covered by the Bill, which is limited to those for which legislation is needed to change the method of up-rating. In other cases it is already possible to up-rate by reference to the historic movement in prices. The main benefits not covered by the Bill are supplementary benefit, child benefit, one-parent benefit, family income supplement, mobility allowance and war pensions. We have, of course, already announced a substantial increase in the rates of child benefit from November, as well as a range of other social security improvements. As for other benefits, it is our intention to up-rate these in November 1983 broadly in the same way as the benefits covered by the Bill. That is, we shall have regard to the historic movement in prices over the 12 months from May 1982 to May 1983. Details of the proposed November up-rating will be announced in June.<lb/>
My Lords, two final points. Your Lordships may ask why we do not restore the link that existed for five years to 1980 whereby basic retirement pension and related long-term benefits rose by movements in earnings or prices, whichever was the higher. The fact is that that system led to a "ratchet" effect whereby benefits in the long run increased faster than either earnings or prices, and this was placing a growing burden on the working population, particularly at a time of high unemployment. Each 1 per cent. real improvement in social security expenditure costs the country about &#x00A3;300 million more a year. That can only be paid out of higher taxes or contributions. It would be irresponsible to introduce provisions of that kind, irrespective of the country's ability to pay.<lb/>
Second, it may be suggested that we could now move towards more frequent up-ratings at, say, six-monthly intervals. But that again involves a major increase in benefit expenditure and again serves to increase inflationary pressures at a time when we are working successfully to bring inflation under firm control. Each 1 per cent. of the annual up-rating
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0025"/>
<col>33</col>
brought forward by six months means &#x00A3;150 million more benefit cost in that year. It also leads to pressure for similar concessions for wage earners, again at inceased costs; and it means that the department's staff would be continuously engaged in up-rating benefits. As one was being implemented, so the next would be announced, to the immense confusion of pensioners and the public at large.<lb/>
I conclude by reminding your Lordships that we are introducing this Bill at a time when we have brought down the annual rate of inflation to its lowest level for 13 years. This in itself is of considerable help to social security beneficiaries. This Bill further helps them by restoring simplicity, certainty and stability to the process of up-rating social security benefits. I commend the Bill to the House.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Trefgarne.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00374">4.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00375"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for making this obscure Bill as clear as possible. My first criticism, which relates to the cost of living, is that this Bill, consisting of three and a half blank pages and three and a half printed pages, costs &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;30. I know that this is not the responsibility of the Minister, but many people are very concerned about what seems to be the increasing cost of official documentation. I very much hope that an opportunity will be taken to look at this matter.<lb/>
Although the scope of the Bill is narrow, it has wide implications. The main concern of pensioners is not with the academic argument about forecast or historic assessments, but simply with the result: under the Bill, will they be better or worse off? The very respectable organisation called Age Concern suggests that as a result of these changes the Government will save &#x00A3;105 million in the year 1983&#x2013;84. If the Government save, somebody loses. I cannot help but contrast this with the tax give-away in 1979 off &#x00A3;1,590 million&#x2014;15 times as much&#x2014;to the best off, in the higher tax brackets.<lb/>
I understood that the autumn Budget statement provided for a saving of &#x00A3;180 million on social security. This causes a certain amount of confusion. In the other place&#x2014;I refer to <i>Hansard</i> of 20th April, col. 302&#x2014;it was suggested that these changes would save the Government &#x00A3;210 million. Is the Minister able to say what is the correct answer? Mr. Hugh Rossi said on 20th April, at col. 328:
<quote>"The arithmetical difference in 1983&#x2013;84 between an assumption of 4 per cent. inflation and an assumption of 6 per cent. inflation is &#x00A3;210 million".</quote>
I have to ask the Minister what sum of money we are talking about. If the Government are saving that sum of money, from whom are they taking it away?<lb/>
This Bill affects about 20 million people, including dependants, which is a very large proportion of our population. Clause 1 proposes to increase the sums in question by a percentage or amount at least equal to the percentage by which the general level of prices has risen during the period under review. Is that reference to the "general level of prices" based on the retail price index? Has it any connection with the pensioner price index? Does it take into account that so far as retired

people are concerned only 2 per cent. of pensioners have mortgages? Mortgage rates, we know, are reflected quite considerably in the retail price index&#x2014;and quite rightly. In the other place there was a great deal of discussion about the position of the retired pensioner. But this Bill concerns not only the retired but widows, unemployed, invalids, people receiving supplementary benefits and public service pensioners. I am grateful that the noble Lord made it clear that it does not refer to war pensioners and war widows, and I hope he may say in reply what proposals the Government have to help these people, who are really having a really difficult time.<lb/>
I have to ask the Minister one or two other questions. If this whole scheme is based on the fact that there will be a gap between the inflation rate in May and what the inflation rate is in November, what happens to people who die in between? Surely they will never get their money back? What would happen to an unemployed man who was on this lower rate&#x2014;because he was told to wait until November when he might get a bit more&#x2014;in the most unlikely circumstance, under this present Government, that he found a job before November? Will he ever get his money back under this arrangement? I must ask the noble Lord the Minister: could we not with modern technology get a shorter gap? We know all about the computerisation that is supposed to be coming in in 1984&#x2013;85. Can we not get something closer between the forecast and the implementation, or is everybody still sitting around with pens and pencils at the Elephant and Castle and the other places? Surely we could try to bring these things together. Perhaps I may put it to the noble Lord that we might have a six-monthly up-rating. I am not making any party point, because no party can take any pride in its record on this. But it does seem to me that a speedier up-rating is what the pensioners of this country deserve.<lb/>
I want to ask the noble Lord one or two questions. Can he give an assurance that if inflation is higher in November than in May they will ensure that social security beneficiaries do not lose? What all the people concerned with this Bill want to know is whether they are going to be worse off, and many of them feel that they are going to be worse off. Obviously, if the May inflation rate is 4 per cent. and pensioners have to wait until November, when we are told that inflation might be 6 per cent., there will be a gap in their income. We really must know from the noble Lord the Minister what the position is to be. How can we help them? I would suggest that, to avoid a lot of paperwork, if there is a 2 per cent. rise in inflation between May and November, that on my illiterate, innumerate calculations would come to about one week's benefit, and it might be that, without a lot of clerical work, we could just double up the benefit for a week in November, just add one week's money. Otherwise, there could be a disguised clawback for many of these people.<lb/>
I am encouraged in suggesting that there ought to be some changes by paragraph 35 of the report of the Social Services Committee of the House of Commons, which says:
<quote>"We recommend that in developing its operational strategy the Department bear in mind the considerable advantages that would accrue from the possibility of swifter and more frequent up-rating."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0026"/>
<col>35</col>
A year is a very long time for people who are on benefit to have to wait while the Government do all the arithmetic and work out what should happen to them.<lb/>
I must say a word about Clause 2 housing benefits. This is a Second Reading debate, so perhaps I may go a little wider than the actual Bill. I want to ask the Minister if he is satisfied with what is happening about the housing benefits provisions which have been brought in. How many people are receiving their entitlement? What monitoring is going on to ensure that this drastic change is being effective? I want to ask the noble Lord if housing benefits will be increased as rents or mortgage charges go up, or is the assessment to be annual? The Government promised at an earlier stage that nobody would be more than 70p a week worse off. I do not understand why anybody should be even 70p a week worse off. But I wonder whether if there are not some who are even more badly off at the present time. Have all the councils received the extra money they need, the extra staff? My information is that there is chaos as regards housing benefits. There are 6&#x00B7;7 million householders involved, and I am told that in Newcastle-on-Tyne, for instance, the staff went on strike because of the extra work for which no provision, no extra staff, had been provided. The computers had not been programmed. If only they would abolish computers they might get on better.<lb/>
I am told that the switchboards are jammed in most of the council offices in the country, that the review boards of appeal have in many cases not been set up. I am told that about 40 local authorities have ordered a computer package from ICL, to be delivered in March, but it has not arrived. Guildford sent out 2,000 emergency handwritten cheques. That is the computer age for you&#x0021; That was the only way the people in Guildford could get their money. In Salford, faults in the computer package forced the council to issue letters, old-fashioned letters, to 5,200 people advising them that their housing benefit had been wrongly assessed. In Newark all standard housing benefit cases have been wrongly assessed due to computer error. I am taking these figures from an issue of <i>New Society</i> of 28th April. If the Minister wishes to say that they are all wrong, then the House will be interested to hear about that.<lb/>
I could go on to describe other difficulties, not only from this article but difficulties about which I know from my own information, which show that this system is in chaos and there has been a breakdown in most parts of the country. The liaison between the DHSS offices and local authorities is in a shambles. Supplementary benefit claimants cannot get their money. Landlords are trying to evict people for nonpayment of rent when their non-payment is due to the fact that they have not got the money they are supposed to get.<lb/>
Then the DHSS office has, among other things, something which is called a yellow form. This is supposed to go to private tenants on supplementary benefit. There appears to be a problem about the yellow forms because some local authorities are receiving hundreds of these and some are not receiving any at all. There seems to be an impossibility of matching the yellow forms to entitlement to housing benefit so that if there are no yellow forms the private
<col>36</col>
tenants are not being paid their housing benefit. Therefore, they cannot pay their rent to the landlord and the landlord starts to throw them out. I cannot believe that that was the intention of even this Government, and I cannot believe that is what the Minister wanted.<lb/>
I hope he can answer some of these questions because, as we said on a previous debate, it seems that the extra resources are not being made available. A lot of extra resources are needed to give local authorities the staff and the abililty to deal with this switchover. That has not happened. This matter has been pushed through in a very raw and difficult state. I apologise for spending time&#x2014;I and hope your Lordships will not think is too much time&#x2014;on the housing benefits part of the Bill; but, as an former chairman of a housing committee, I am very concerned about what is happening.<lb/>
This Bill is so complicated and difficult that I should like to know what steps the Government will take to explain the provisions to the people who ought to benefit from it? Often the people who need to benefit from such legislation are those least able to understand and to realise what their rights are. For instance, if someone is not entitled to supplementary benefit in June, will they be reminded to come back in November? By then they might be entitled to it. What are the Government doing about the take-up problem which we have often discussed in this House? I think that all sides of the House have agreed that there is a fall in take-up, about which we should all be concerned.<lb/>
I have one final question which I put very seriously to the Minister. I understand that the 17th June is a vital day because then we expect to hear the May figures for inflation and that everything will depend on what is announced on that day. If, for the best of all possible reasons, the House is not sitting, can the Minister asure us that people who will be entitled to some up-rating will not be left in suspense because the House will not&#x2014;as I hope it will not&#x2014;be sitting on the 17th June?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00376">4.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00377"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, for his very clear exposition of the purpose and content of this Bill. We on these Benches agree with the linking of benefits to prices. We wish that all benefits were linked to prices, particularly the death grant. We regret that long-term benefits are no longer linked to earnings as well as prices. The noble Lord the Minister referred to that and again to the ratchet effect. I have said previously in this House that we on these Benches are not worried about the ratchet effect because we do not consider that the retirement benefit level is adequate. We accept that there has to be a measure of redistribution if it is to be made adequate, and we believe that we have provided a means of doing that in the tax credit scheme which we have recently published.<lb/>
The main purpose of the Bill is to deal with the change from the forecast method of assessing inflation to the historic. I want to speak very briefly about that not because it is unimportant but because I believe that the essence of the matter can be put very shortly. I believe that the move is right in principle. I have
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0027"/>
<col>37</col>
often said that the Government should make such a move and that it was unsatisfactory to have a period of reference which was half in the past and half in the future, and which involved an element of guessing.<lb/>
The noble Lord the Minister said that the Government have in fact got the guess wrong five times out of seven. Of course, when that happens there are arguments about making good or clawing back. I believe that those disadvantages outweigh the disadvantage in the historic method of a period of delay, although I am glad to hear from the Minister this evening that there are plans to reduce that period as much as possible.<lb/>
In advocating this move in the past I have said that it ought to be done at a time when inflation is going down. A time of rising inflation, when the Government themselves estimate that inflation will rise, is not the right time to make the change because at such a time beneficiaries lose. it has been explained by the Minister, and referred to by the noble Baroness, that the Government expect inflation will be running at an annual rate of about 4 per cent. in May and at about 6 per cent. by the time we get to next November.<lb/>
Last year there was an over-estimate, as the noble Lord said, of over 2 per cent. in the forecast and there was speculation as to whether there would be a claw-back. To make the change from the forecast method to the historic method at a time when beneficiaries are likely to lose 2 per cent. must make the operation seem like a backstairs method of obtaining the claw-back, whether or not that is actually the Government's motive. It is undoubtedly true that recipients will be worse off this year and there is no guarantee that they will be fully compensated in the next year. I will not go into the arithmetic of that latter point this afternoon, but no doubt we can do so at a later stage if it seems appropriate.<lb/>
I must say that some of the criticism from the Labour Front Bench on this issue is a little like the pot calling the kettle black because a Labour Government introduced the present system at a time of falling inflation, thus depriving beneficiaries of &#x00A3;500 million in 1976. Beneficiaries had reason to suppose that they would get an up-rating of 21 per cent. to match the historic rise in inflation but in fact they only received 15 per cent. I was one of those in this House who objected to that at the time.<lb/>
It is not surprising therefore if the public are cynical about these changes. A move from the historic to the forecast system needs a static or rising inflation rate if beneficiaries are not to lose. A move from the forecast to the historic needs a static or falling inflation rate if beneficiaries are not to lose. In fact both Governments chose the wrong moment to do it so that there was a loss on each occasion.<lb/>
If the present Government, in the present situation, had acted when they were estimating a declining inflation rate they could have gone back to the more satisfactory historic method with much wider support than they now have. I regret that they have not done that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00378">4.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00379"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is difficult to make a well-rounded Second Reading speech on a Bill of this
<col>38</col>
nature. The intentions of the Bill are perfectly clear and in any case have been explained by the noble Lord with his customary clarity. They are to change the basis of indexation for all those benefits listed in Schedule 4, Parts 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Social Security Act 1975 and of the housing benefit needs allowances introduced by the 1982 Act. The noble Lord also told us that there are certain other benefits, for which legislation is not required, which will be subjected in due course to the same method.<lb/>
The present method of forecasting at the time of the Budget followed by an implementing order in the summer and implementation at the end of November is to be replaced by the so called historic method whereby uprating is carried out strictly in relation to past movements in prices and housing costs and assessed each June on the experience over the preceding 12 months up to 31st May.<lb/>
Now this may seem superficially more accurate and therefore to have much to recommend it. Indeed, it is a return to the original method. It would avoid the need for clawing back when an over-estimate has been made or for restoring the shortfall when the forecast has under-estimated the rate of inflation. It would also save the Government the embarrassment of having to decide whether to claw back relatively small over-payments to pensioners and whether or not to make good shortfalls where these occur&#x2014;matters which form the general substance of so many of our social security debates in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
It does, however, seem rather curious that the Government have had these second thoughts on their method of assessment so soon after the passing of the 1982 Act and consider these second thoughts of sufficient importance to bring forward yet another Bill less than a year after that Act became law. It cannot be any coincidence that they have chosen their new basis precisely at the moment when inflation has hit its lowest point for years (as the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, himself pointed out) and when it can hardly do anything but rise.<lb/>
Thus, as the noble Lord, Lord Banks, pointed out, those affected are very likely to be living off a 4 per cent. increase, while inflation is rising to 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. If the next adjustment is to, say, 6 per cent., they may well find inflation outstripping them again and rising to 8 per cent. over that period. Other than on a falling inflation rate, they will always be out of pocket.<lb/>
Now the explanatory memorandum of the Bill tells us that there will be no effect on public service manpower, which seems pretty obvious. It will presumably take the same number of people to make the annual calculations and produce the benefit books by one method or another. But what the memorandum does not tell us is what calculation has been made of the effect on public expenditure. Age Concern, which has already been referred to by Lady Jeger, have estimated that the Government will save approximately &#x00A3;105 million on pensions alone in 1983&#x2013;84 and that total savings will be in the region of &#x00A3;210 million. That is a figure which also emerged and was quoted in the debates on this subject in another place. I think the Government should tell us if they agree with those estimates, and, if so, how they can reconcile them with their undertaking to maintain the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0028"/>
<col>39</col>
real value of pensions, which the noble Lord claimed has been honoured so far. Even if that is so, it does not take into account what will happen on a rising inflation rate.<lb/>
It seems to me that if the Government are determined to revert to the old system of up-rating, this makes the case a great deal stronger (if only in the interests of accuracy) for more frequent up-ratings of pensions. Although the Minister, Mr. Rossi, during the Committee stage in another place claimed that biannual up-ratings were so administratively complicated as to be beyond contemplation, this was shot down by my honourable friend Mr. Mike Thomas, and this is a matter we may well want to revert to at the Committee stage in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Speaking more generally, I do not wish to seem to treat public expenditure lightly. I do not. I am well aware of the high percentage of national income which is taken up by social security in one form or another. It is perfectly proper for this to be kept under review. But it is equally important that those who are struggling to keep up the most minimal standards of civilised life should not be squeezed intolerably. At a time of profound structural change in industry, with far-reaching effects on the people of this country&#x2014;including widespread unemployment and earlier retirement&#x2014;it is vital that the social security system, in combination with the tax system, should perform its function and be seen to perform that function, which is to ensure a fair distribution of sacrifices and rewards. I believe it is very important that the Government keep this in mind and resist the temptation to nibble away at every possible opportunity at the minimum requirements for survival in a harsh industrial climate. It is quite wrong to think you can only afford a good social security system when times are good. It is when times are hard that you need it most.<lb/>
Since Social Security Bills are generally used as an occasion for fairly wide-ranging debate in the social security field&#x2014;and particularly as this Bill does not in itself give us a great deal to discuss&#x2014;I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I mention briefly the Supplementary Benefit (Requirements) (Long-Term Rates) Amendment Regulations 1983 which were passed by your Lordships on the nod last Thursday. I had intended to say a short word about this, but, while I was politely waiting for the Opposition Front Bench spokesman, Lady Jeger, to rise to her feet, the Question was put and the occasion passed. In fact, I had intended to welcome the measure, which in effect removes entirely the qualifying period of 52 weeks in receipt of a supplementary allowance before a man over 60 can opt for the long-term rate of the supplementary benefit until the pensionable age of 65. I believe that this is a further small step in the right direction&#x2014;that is, in easing withdrawal from the labour market of those who are very unlikely to find further full-time employment.<lb/>
It was one of the recommendations of your Lordships' Select Committee on Unemployment (I think at Chapter 14, paragraph 46) that the long-term unemployed over 55 should in effect be able to opt for early retirement on long-term supplementary benefit
<col>40</col>
rates. While congratulating the noble Lord on the Government's opening up this option unconditionally to all men over 60, I was going to ask him what the Government's intentions are towards those a little further down the age range. I hope he would agree with the Select Committee that it is one of the best, cheapest and most humane ways of bringing about a reduction in the supply of labour at the older end of the market. Of course, I shall not expect an answer from him this evening, but I wanted to get this down on the record, and perhaps I might hope for a letter in due course indicating whether the Government intend to extend this option progressively downwards to those over 55 who are unlikely to obtain further work.<lb/>
Finally, as I have said, we are somewhat suspicious of the Government's motivation in bringing this Bill to Parliament at this particular time, as the noble Lord, Lord Banks, has also suggested. We would agree both with the Government and with him that the historic principle is the right one, but whether this was the moment to do it, and what the immediate effects will be on pensioners and other beneficiaries, is not entirely clear. I shall reserve our detailed criticism until the Committee stage of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00380">5.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00381"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I intervene merely to assist the Minister. As someone who has been a spokesman on social security both in Government and from the Opposition Front Bench, I have maintained a great interest in it. I should merely like to repeat a comment that I have made at least twice before when the question of pensions has been raised. We have heard tonight how very complicated it is to make the calculations because of the varying types of benefit, but I would suggest that a very large number of retirement pensioners (certainly widows) receive possibly an identical amount. We are told that the length of time between the calculation and the actual starting of a given benefit has to be something like five or six months. It has always amazed me why Governments do not adopt the methods that other institutions do. It is different when people are going to take money away from you. Increased prices can be introduced the following day. British Rail have a very simple method of increasing the price on tickets. They use a rubber stamp. I suggest that they do it on millions of tickets. They are not concerned with only a few. For a long time we had a &#x00A3;25 marking on a cheque card. The banks told us that that could automatically be read as &#x00A3;50 if you wished to withdraw that amount.<lb/>
On the ordinary, uncomplicated retirement pension benefit book, for &#x00A3;31 we could in future easily read &#x00A3;32. It is hardly likely to be &#x00A3;62 under this Government. It seems to me that anything which will shorten the period between the announcement of an increase and its actual receipt can only be for the benefit of people, who, as my noble friend Lady Jeger explained, may perhaps never live to collect any increased benefits. The length of time needed for this calculation has always been advanced as one reason for the delay. This is something that any Government should look at to shorten the period.</membercontribution></p>

extremely short but very detailed speech. Unlike another speaker, I do not rise exactly to assist the Minister. The noble Baroness, Lady Phillips, did so. With regard to the point which she made about British Rail altering fares, I would say that this is quite easy to do. A supermarket can alter its prices overnight, though unfortunately in most cases they go up, instead of down.<lb/>
Today we debate yet another social security Bill. The number of social security Bills put forward during the life of this Parliament must be an absolute record. The theme of all of them has been financial saving, and this one is no exception. This is a curate's egg of a Bill, good in parts, but not so good in other parts. Indeed, quite a proportion of it seems good on the surface, but after scrutiny is found to be not so good. It is estimated that overall, as a result of the various Government measures on social security and allied benefits, savings effected so far by the Government amount to &#x00A3;2 billion. References have been made to estimates by Age Concern of savings of &#x00A3;105 million. At least two noble Lords have spoken about it. This relates to pensions alone, and is based on the theory that 4 per cent. now will be 6 per cent. in November. In another place Members have made the savings total even more, but of course they might be guessing. I should say that Age Concern is more likely to be accurate.<lb/>
The cut of 5 per cent. in unemployment benefit imposed in 1980 is at last to be made good, though not until November. This is to be welcomed as far as it goes. The restoration comes 16 months after unemployment benefit became taxable. Its effect upon the incomes of the unemployed will be negligible, since for the majority of them it will be matched by an equivalent reduction in their supplementary benefit. The unemployed aged over 60 are now immediately entitled to the long-term rate of supplementary benefit. However once again the under-60s do not receive it&#x2014;a situation which in 1981 the Social Security Advisory Committee described as "wholly unjust".<lb/>
The closing of the "invalidity trap" is to be welcomed, but entitling invalidity pensioners under 60 to claim the long-term rate of supplementary benefit after one year on invalidity benefit and immediately entitling those over 60 mean that the Government are forcing people on to a means-tested supplementary benefit, rather than improving their National Insurance benefit.<lb/>
I now turn to another 5 per cent. cut, which is not mentioned in the Bill. I wish to ask the Government: when will the 5 per cent. cut in invalidity benefit be restored? It has not so far been mentioned in today's debate, and it is certainly not mentioned in the Bill.<lb/>
When a week yesterday there was telephoned to me news of the change of business for today, my immediate reaction was, "Ah&#x0021; So it's to be a June election". That may of course be so if the headmistress makes up her mind. But as my noble friend Lady Jeger has mentioned, June plays a significant part in the Bill. It plays a significant part simply because it will be the month of decision on the amount of benefits up-rating based on price increases as at 31st May, not on a forecast of price increases in November, with inflation likely to be at 4 per cent. at the end of May and a Government forecast of an inflation rate of 6 per cent.
<col>42</col>
in November. That is rather interesting and very clever stuff on the part of the Government. There is no straightforward (if that is the appropriate word) clawback, but rather a devious way of securing recovery of last year's overshoot of 2.7 per cent. which was due to miscalculation in forward forecasting. This afternoon various suggestions on forecasting have been made, including the use of more computers, and other methods. But whatever method is adopted, forecasting cannot be accurate. The fairest way is to relate the issue to prices or wages, whichever is the higher, as was past practice. Furthermore, I would add that there is certainly a need for more frequent reviews, though one cannot reasonably suggest reviews more often than every six months.<lb/>
It is said that this House contains many experts on many subjects. I do not pretend to be one of those, except on the matter of shopping. I make that claim advisedly because I have been well trained. On the subject of inflation I would say that many items used in Government calculations do not appear in the budget of the pensioner, the unemployed, and other types of social security beneficiary. I now come to the expert bit. Being closely involved in my household's weekly shopping, as well as being sent on my own on other occasions&#x2014;having been well trained, as I have said&#x2014;I am well aware that prices of food and other essential items for families or individuals on a small budget do not seem to be going down: on the contrary, they seem to be going up. It is quite usual to hear among elderly pensioners when shopping the comment, "They say inflation has gone down. I don't know where&#x2014;money doesn't seem to go far these days". That is a very frequent comment. I have heard it when going around the shops, and virtually every Friday my wife says it to me, too. So make no mistake about it, my Lords: I know something about it.<lb/>
Comments of that kind indicate what is nowadays a fact of life for people on social security benefits. The retail price index does not fully reflect the expenditure pattern of pensioners and others on benefits. This is borne out in a recent report&#x2014;House of Commons Paper 123&#x2014;of the Social Services Select Committee, which stated:
<quote>"There are good grounds for believing that the welcome fall in the rate of inflation over the past 12 months has not been fully reflected in the expenditure patterns of pensioners and other groups of social security beneficiaries".</quote>
By way of example the committee pointed to fuel and light costs, which account for a higher proportion of the expenditure of pensioners and low income families than that of other households. Between November and December 1982 the fuel and light component of the RPI (the retail price index) rose by 2 per cent., and the RPI itself rose by only 0.5 per cent. There is no doubt whatever&#x2014;it must be done somehow&#x2014;that the official pensioners' price index, quite apart from the retail price index, urgently needs to be reviewed.<lb/>
Of course, the cost of benefits is becoming a national financial burden, but we must not forget that a figure of well over 3 million unemployed is costly to the nation financially and represents a pitiful waste of human energy and resource. What is the annual cost of unemployment benefit and allied supplementary benefit? Whatever huge sum it might be, it represents the cost to the country of Government policy.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0030"/>
<col>43</col>
I note that Clause 3(2) of the Bill, on page 3, states:
<quote>"This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on 16th March 1983".</quote>
In other words, although we have not yet passed the Bill and Royal Assent is still awaited, its provisions are to be backdated. Why? Has it anything to do with a June election? That brings me to a point made by my noble friend Lady Jeger, and I should like to go into perhaps a little more detail. Parliament could be prorogued in June or even late May. The retail price index comes out on 17th June which is also the starting date for changing the books of millions of beneficiaries. I wish to know whether a decision will be reached and operated without parliamentary approval.<lb/>
Another point is the great inconvenience caused to those on the Labour Benches and other Benches on this side of the House. I understand that the committee stage is being pushed forward to Monday 9th May. What is the reason for what appear to be these panic measures? The whole matter is being rushed through with indecent haste.<lb/>
This Bill, compared to some, appears on the surface to be a small measure with only three clauses. With one honourable exception, it is of interest only to the Front Benches of this House. But, in my view, it is a cunning and devious measure carefully calculated to deceive. It is window dressing for a possible early election. The Bill is probably the last of a long series of social security measures during the lifetime of this Parliament. If that is the case, I welcome it with a great sigh of relief.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00385"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I, too, welcome the measure, but perhaps for rather different reasons from those of the noble Lord. I am grateful to every noble Lord and noble Baroness who has contributed. I cannot say that all of them agree with every single word that appears in the Bill. I fancy, however, that the main thrust of the proposals, which, as I stated in my opening remarks, is to replace doubt with certainty and unreliability with stability, has found an echo even with noble Lords and noble Baronesses opposite.<lb/>
A number of points have been put to me. I shall deal with as many as possible and at least with the most important of them. Any that I fail properly to deal with now, I shall endeavour to respond to subsequently by correspondence. The noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, asked how much money was to be saved by these proposals. This point was echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock. The difference between the money that will be caused to be spent in the increases this year and the money that might have been spent had the old system still been in force or some other system devised would have depended upon the assumptions that we made when we were forecasting, as it fell to us to do, under the old system. I can go no further than my honourable friends in the other place when they mentioned various figures that had been mooted and which they broadly confirmed. For example, the basic difference between a 4 per cent. and a 6 per cent. up-rating is indeed about &#x00A3;210 million. That was one of the figures to which the noble
<col>44</col>
Baroness, I think, referred. But these figures, emphasise, are speculative. They are based on various assumptions that may or may not have proved accurate in the upshot.<lb/>
What we have done, as your Lordships will appreciate, is to alter the basis of these calculations so that pensioners know precisely where they stand. To take up another point made by the noble Baroness, the shortfall, if there is one, in the June up-rating, when it comes to be announced, will, of course, be made good in the following year because the reassessment period runs from May to May.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, also asked a number of points about housing benefit. The implementation of housing benefit reassessment in local offices and local authorities has generally been completed at least as fast as the reassessment of cases for rent changes in previous years under the old scheme. Progress reports have been collected from various local authorities. I understand that, as soon as they have been collected, my honourable friend the Minister for Social Security will make the results known in an appropriate way.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked me about progress in implementing the scheme of housing benefits. My honourable friend intends to make some observations about that. I cannot deny that there have been some local problems and doubtless a few individual mistakes. That is not surprising when we consider that we are introducing a new scheme involving over 5 million claimants. However, there have been no breakdowns. Ministers have received practically no correspondence from right honourable and honourable Members of another place. From my own experience, I am certain that had there been any widespread difficulty we would have received a welter of correspondence from honourable Members, and indeed from noble Lords.<lb/>
Progress reports entering our headquarters show that local offices reassessed nearly 90 per cent. of supplementary benefit claimants in the main start by 18th March, which was their target date. Most of the remaining cases were completed by Easter. On the local authority side, three-quarters of the existing rebate changes were reassessed on time. Where cases had not been reassessed on time, this was due to a variety of factors, often local in origin and, in many cases, not directly associated with housing benefit. A good example of difficulties was the recent industrial action in DHSS offices at Birmingham and Oxford that had a knock-on effect on housing benefits.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, asked me about publicity for what she regarded as this complex measure. I am not sure that it is a complex measure. I think, on the contrary, that we are introducing a much more certain and reliable arrangement for pensioners. The announcement, when it comes to be made in June, will be subject to affirmative parliamentary resolution, I think by both Houses, immediately after, or at an appropriate moment after, the order is laid. The noble Baroness asked me some other points about housing benefit. I can assure her that the amount of housing benefit that a person receives goes up when rents and rates rise as well as when the needs allowances are increased.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0031"/>
<col>45</col>
The noble Baroness also asked about the link with mortgage costs. The housing benefit scheme is designed to help with the cost of rent and rates. It does not give assistance specifically with mortgage costs. That being so, movements in mortgage interest do not play a part in settling the rate of the housing benefit needs allowance. Because of this, the change to a historical review has no particular relevance to the measurement of mortgage costs for the purpose of up-rating the needs allowances. The costs are therefore outside the scope of the scheme.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Banks, drew attention to the Liberal plans to which I believe he was a significant contributor. I referred to that scheme when the noble Lord spoke on the social security orders the other day. Perhaps I need not say more about that now. The noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, and the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, asked me about extending the long-term scale rate to those below 60 years of age. I was asked for an indication of Government thinking on the proposal to extend entitlement down from the age of 60 to 55. I can tell both noble Lords that they should not have to wait too long. The proposal was one of those included in the report of Social Services Committee on the age of retirement. The Government are still considering that report and their detailed response. We hope to make our views known shortly. I cannot, of course, forecast what our decision will be on the particular matter that has been raised, but we shall touch upon it in our response.<lb/>
I was also asked by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, why abatement is still applied to invalidity pension. We have undertaken that the abatement of invalidity pension will be made good when invalidity benefit is brought into tax. A date for that has not yet been fixed. If there are any other points that I have not properly dealt with, I shall be happy to reply to them in correspondence. Meanwhile, I invite your Lordships to give the Bill a second reading. I beg to move.<lb/>

<title>American Bases in Britain</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00388">5.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00389"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask the Unstarred Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. I should like to begin by reading the Question. It is:
<quote>"To ask Her Majesty's Government why they have been reluctant to reveal the growth of American nuclear and other bases in this country and whether they now agree that it is urgent to establish British operational control over nuclear weapons at all such bases."</quote>
<col>46</col>
The Question is framed in a manner which I hope will maximise support. It in no way attempts to go to the position which some of us might like to follow, and that is to get rid of nuclear weapons altogether. The Question does not even go to the point of saying that the cruise missile and the Pershing II missile should not be deployed at all. However, many of us&#x2014;and a larger number than those who believe in total nuclear disarmament&#x2014;would at least go so far as to say that Pershing II and cruise missiles should not be deployed and would only exacerbate the nuclear tensions which now spread over Europe.<lb/>
The Question goes only a very small way indeed, but it goes to a point which I believe will gain the support of all those speakers who are to take part in this short debate with the possible exception of the noble Lord, Lord Belstead. However, I hope that even he may say that such is the moderation of the Question put to him that the Government are looking at it with great care and that they are in negotiation with the American Government with a view to re-asserting British control over nuclear weapons in our own area.<lb/>
Therefore, it is a modest question, a question which will not only unite every member of the Labour Party, but will, I believe, carry with it the spokesman on the Liberal Benches, who, in my view, is now a spokesman for peace. He has his own ideas, but whatever may have been the case in the past, today the noble Lord is a man who, in his own way, is seeking peace as indeed are most of us. I believe also that I shall carry with me in this Question the noble Lord, Lord Kennet. And, of course, we shall have Labour support. Indeed, I think that on this occasion the Front Bench will have no difficulty in going the whole way with me, though they would probably regard the Question as not going far enough and would like it to go a good deal farther. So should I; but I shall endeavour to restrain my noble friend on this occasion from dismissing this as a small and insufficient measure, on the grounds that on this occasion what we are really trying to do is not to castigate the Government but to bring them with us, to put forward something which I believe all patriotic Conservatives would say was close to their heart&#x2014;namely, the reassertion of the power of this Government in their own territory, if not over the face of the globe. I am pretty sure, too, that we shall carry many Cross-Benchers with us.<lb/>
Therefore, I think that we shall have a majority of the House, but I am not sure whether we shall carry the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, with us. Experience shows that one should not be too optimistic about that. However, we shall hope that, by the end of the debate, such will be the power, not of what I say but of what noble Lords who follow me will say in support of the Question, that the noble Lord will give us an answer which, if not in the complete, immediate affirmative will be of such a character as to lead us to believe that there may be some hope, whereas at present there is little but despair.<lb/>
In this Question I have referred to the reluctance of the Government to reveal the growth of American bases in this country. I shall demonstrate that apparent reluctance in a moment. But it occurs to me that it may be not so much a case of reluctance as&#x2014;I was going to say of ignorance; but in my new-found policy of conciliation with the Government I shall not say
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0032"/>
<col>47</col>
that. I shall suggest instead that it is a question of lack of knowledge, which I shall describe in a moment.<lb/>
In a previous debate I referred to the American military presence in this country as being that of a country within a country. Of course one country does not always know what is going on in another, even when that country's military and intelligence network exists within the borders, the waters, and the air-space of the host country.<lb/>
The pattern of American military presence in Europe was established first in Germany. Of course the Germans during the war and immediately after it were not told what was going on and nobody thought that they should be told or expected that it was proper for them to be told. But that pattern appears to have been followed throughout Europe. Indeed, it is understandable that it was followed throughout Europe. After all, the American forces landed with our own in France and advanced throughout Europe and established their methodology of operation throughout the whole of Europe and, indeed, in their bases&#x2014;mostly air force bases, but many other bases as well&#x2014;in this country at that time.<lb/>
It is not clear that the American military and communications complex draws any sharp distinction between its role and behaviour in an ex-enemy country and its similar presence on the territory of European countries which are now seen as forward bases in the struggle against the Soviet Union. There is, in fact, no fundamental difference in the methodology deployed by the American network in Germany, England, Belgium or Holland.<lb/>
The nearer one comes to Soviet-controlled territory, the more apparent is the American presence. But apart from that, the policy is for the United States forces to be self-sufficient&#x2014;to have their own communications network, their own food and entertainment, certainly not to live off the land of the host country; and for the presence of thousands of servicemen to be as inconspicuous as possible. It is a far cry from the wartime intermingling depicted in the film "Yanks"&#x2014;something which I remember well from my own service days, because I worked with the Americans on and off from the time of the Eagle Squadron in the Royal Air Force until the end of the war in Europe.<lb/>
Let no one imagine that I am remotely anti-American; on the contrary, experience has given me much admiration for that country. I must say that I cannot admire their political system as much as I do our own, with all the faults that I discern even in our own&#x2014;faults with which, on some other occasion, I shall probably bore your Lordships, but certainly not tonight. As much as I dislike and, frankly, am afraid of the present Government of the United States&#x2014;and I think that there are many Americans who share that fear&#x2014;this does not remotely mean that I am in any way anti-American or that anybody who discerns danger in the American presence in this country becomes anti-American. Not at all. We believe that we are speaking for the best in America, because there are many Americans who are, as I shall demonstrate by quoting in a moment, concerned with current developments of the American industrial military complex, as are many of us in this country.<lb/>
<col>48</col>
First, I deal with the apparent reluctance to disclose the extent of the American military presence. In June 1980 the Foreign Secretary disclosed the existence of 12 American bases. In another place Mr. Cryer pressed for this disclosure of back-up and communications bases. The matter developed, but before I proceed, I would point out that in their own way these back-up and communications bases are just as important as the forward operational bases. Mr. Pym, then Defence Secretary, listed another 38 such bases. A month later another three emerged, making a total of 53 disclosed in 1980. But in November of that year another 10 operating bases were found, and finally this year the total went up to 75.<lb/>
It is known that there are even more than this. A map and a list were published in the <i>New Statesman</i>&#x2014;apparently, it was a Soviet military map&#x2014;so the department of the noble Lord was pressed still further, this time without result. But according to Mr. Duncan Campbell, who is the authority on the subject, writing in the <i>Observer</i>, the list is still incomplete. The Government's admissions include small, unmanned communications relay stations but omit many important manned sites. The Minister may say that it is only the "titches"&#x2014;the minor ones&#x2014;that have been omitted. That is not actually the case. Some minor bases have been included and some rather major ones have been left out. All in all, it seems that there may be twice as many as even the much larger number now admitted&#x2014;in other words, somewhere between 100 and 150; certainly not fewer than 100, and a far cry from Mr. Pym's original dozen.<lb/>
My first question to the noble Lord is this. Was this concealment or was it lack of knowledge, or was it both? Was the Government's disinformation on the point intentional, or did they not know? The Minister has claimed that American bases in this country are committed to NATO but, for example, he omitted from the list the Oakhanger tracking station, which is one of the seven stations which cover the United States, Air Force secret military and spy satellites. Over 1000 million dollars was committed to improve Oakhanger and its fellow stations last year.<lb/>
What about Liverpool Port?&#x2014;described as a major installation by the Americans who are much more open about these matters than we are. If one wants information about what the Americans are doing in the United Kingdom, it seems that one either has to go to America for it or to the Soviet Union. In either country one can get much more complete information than any of us have been able to extract from Government Ministers on this, point.<lb/>
Of course, it is the lives of our people who are either to be preserved, as some people would say, or threatened by the existence of these bases. So either way it is important for our people to know what is going on in their name what the Government are permitting and, their reluctance to reveal has been intentional, why it is that they have refused to tell our people&#x2014;who, after all, are the people in the front line&#x2014;what apparently the Russians know all about and what apparently the Americans know all about.<lb/>
As I say, what about Liverpool Port?&#x2014;which is unlisted here, but which is described as a major installation by the Americans. What of six other unlisted
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0033"/>
<col>49</col>
terminals? What about Prestwick? Is that now going ahead or has it been abandoned? Did the Government know about that or not? I think that we are entitled to know.<lb/>
I now turn to the second part of my Question, that of operational control. If we are charitable&#x2014;and, as I have made clear, I am in a charitable mood tonight&#x2014;and we assume that the Government believe their own denial of the existence of most of the American bases in this country to be the reality and the truth at the time, that is even more alarming from the point of view of controlling nuclear weapons. For if the Government are unaware of the extent of our peril, how can they control it?<lb/>
This illustrates a point which I think any staff officer could explain to the noble Lord the Minister: that political control without operational control is ineffective; that operational control is the executive arm of political decision-making, and that without it political orders may well be just whistling in the wind. Let us suppose that during the recent expedition, or sadness, in the South Atlantic we had not exercised effective operational control over the submarines which were deployed there. Let us suppose that the submarines instead of being under British control were under some foreign control, perhaps American. Would there have been a sinking of the "Belgrano"? The Prime Minister would not have been able to give the order. Some of us may believe that that would have been a highly beneficent outcome and that a peace might have been secured if that had not occurred, without the loss of life which followed.<lb/>
I believe that any Member of this House who has any military experience whatever would agree with me that, if you want to be effective, you must have operational control and that political decision-making is not enough in time of tension and, certainly, in time of war. One must be certain that one's orders will be obeyed, and that an order not to fire will be regarded as absolutely sacrosanct and to be obeyed as much as an order to fire.<lb/>
Surely that must be the first essential if we have any regard for the safety of our own people. I charge the Government with being careless with the safety of their own people if they will not exercise their own control, if they will not go to the Americans and say, "If we cannot have control over cruise missiles in our own country, then the price we exact for that is that they will not come here".<lb/>
I want to say why, if we did not have cruise missiles, I do not think that that would be a disaster, or something about which we would be sorry. I believe that it would be a very great benefit to everyone if we never had them at all. The danger of the cruise missiles, and especially of those under foreign operational control in our country, is that they are cheap, small, and impossible to verify. Not only could they not be detected by Soviet satellites, they could not even be checked by the Government, for the Americans enjoy untrammelled rights to bring in what they like and do as they please within their own bases.<lb/>
As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver, has pointed out, privileges which the Americans rightly enjoyed in simpler wartime and post-war years have been extended into a period in which they have
<col>50</col>
become not a protection but a horrible danger to the host country. Those words are mine, not Lord Carver's. But the point I make is that the situation is different today from what it was in the wartime and post-war years, which is the point that the noble and gallant Lord&#x2014;I am sorry he is not here this evening&#x2014;will agree that he has made time and time again. I freely admit that the noble and gallant Lord does not go so far as I should like on many of these issues; but that is also true of many noble Lords who I believe will be speaking in favour of the general line of this Question later in this debate.<lb/>
What is more, the introduction of cruise missiles&#x2014;for of course they will be matched by the Soviet Union&#x2014;means the end of verification, because indeed&#x2014;and I do not think that the noble Lord who will reply to the debate will disagree with me&#x2014;verification of these small weapons is almost an impossibility. The question of where they are&#x2014;and they can be moved about&#x2014;as to whether they are loaded with a nuclear warhead or a conventional warhead are questions impossible of verification. If this is so&#x2014;and I believe that it is&#x2014;certainly they are impossible of verification by satellite, which is the customary method of verification now employed in respect of all the missiles currently deployed&#x2014;then arms control becomes impossible and we are on a straight road to Armageddon.<lb/>
It is no good talking about cruise not being a first strike weapon. Now it is true that the so-called demonstration shot, which NATO chiefs are alarmingly so fond of, would probably be launched by Pershing 2 missiles, or perhaps even by a battlefield weapon, rather than by cruise, but it would be just as fatal. Furthermore, surprise&#x2014;which is the essence of first strike&#x2014;can be achieved militarily in two possible ways. First, as in the case of the Pershing, by speed of attack and quickness of arrival, before the defence can be deployed. But it can also be achieved, as anybody knows who has ever studied these matters, by concealment, by the evasion of detection. That could not be achieved by Pershing, but it is the main characteristic of cruise.<lb/>
Therefore, the question of whether cruise would, or would not, be used in a first strike capacity is a military decision. It has nothing to do with the characteristics of the weapon itself. There is nothing in the slow but evasive approach of the cruise weapon which makes it inherently a second strike weapon. It is 10 times more accurate than the Soviet SS20, and it is impossible to tell by surveillance whether or not the cruise is carrying a nuclear warhead. This means that deterrence is at an end. This is a nuclear war fighting weapon, because you cannot deter by something which your prospective enemy can know nothing about. He therefore can only respond, and that means nuclear war.<lb/>
Cruise, as distinct from Pershing, is not a ballistic missile. It stems from the old German terror weapon, the V bomber. Like it, it is a small, pilotless, self-guiding airplane. It is about 15 feet long. It can reach most parts of the Soviet Union from here, and it can carry a nuclear weapon 15 times as lethal as the Hiroshima bomb. One of them could kill a million people and render the whole of Moscow or Leningrad uninhabitable, full of dead, or dying, men, women and
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0034"/>
<col>51</col>
children. It is extremely accurate, and it is designed to explode within a few meters of its pinpointed target.<lb/>
It can be launched by air, by submarine, by ship, or from a land-based vehicle, say a lorry. The cruise missiles fly close to the ground, and although subsonic are difficult to detect by radar. For that very reason they are subsonic. If there were time I could describe to your Lordships the method. Did I understand the noble Lord to say there is time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00390"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00391"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: No? If that is so, I shall restrain myself, because there are other speakers in the debate. However, my Lords, I understand that the normal limitations which are placed on these debates are not very closely, firmly and heavily upon us this evening for one reason or another. As I was saying, cruise is about 15 feet long and it can carry a weapon of most horrible lethality. Plans for a supersonic model of cruise are well advanced; but in my own view these plans, like most nuclear plans, are a complete waste of time, because already on both sides we have more than enough overkill to destroy each other several times over.<lb/>
The United States now proposes in its present plans to deploy some 3,000 air-launched cruise missiles capable of eliminating the USSR by themselves a thousand times over, and several hundred sea-launched cruise missiles as well. That is as well as the quite unnecessary hundreds of land-based cruise missiles they plan for Britain and the rest of Europe. This brings me to the point I mentioned earlier. If the Government were to decide that they want a dual key arrangement on these weapons or they will not have them, and if the Americans were to say, "All right. No cruise", then the fact that they were not coming here would not decrease our power to resist. On the contrary, it would increase our safety.<lb/>
The plan to fill Europe with these things is the act of a madman, and if they come our civilisation is doomed, and perhaps the expectation of life of a child born today is not greater than my own. We have not the right to deprive our children of a future. It is useless to prate that the nuclear weapon has kept the peace. That point is unprovable. But even if it has, the cruise weapon will bring that peace and our world itself to an end too horrible to be encompassed in the mind of man.<lb/>
There is no secret in the fact that I, like the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, should like to get rid of all nuclear weapons; but in this Question I am putting a much more limited objective. In doing so I think I am speaking, as I said at the beginning, for a large number of people who have not, as yet, come with us all the way on nuclear disarmament. I am not looking for a whole loaf tonight: I am not even asking for half a loaf. A nuclear freeze, I suppose, would be a reasonable half-loaf which would carry many people with us. A nuclear freeze would gain me not only the support of all the Labour Party, but of the SDP and the Liberals, some Cross-Benchers; certainly the noble Lord, Lord Zuckerman&#x2014;who has expressed himself most trenchantly on this issue recently in the
<col>52</col>
<i>Spectator</i>&#x2014;but perhaps even some of the Conservatives. There are Conservatives against the bomb&#x2014;thank God&#x0021;<lb/>
I believe that the balance of argument on this issue has in recent months undergone a subtle change, and that the Government (who were on the attack) are now on the defensive. That is demonstrated by the unnecessarily vigorous nature of the polemic they are currently deploying against CND. Rather than to attack the CND in terms of personality, the Government would do better to ask themselves why these arguments&#x2014;not yet the total argument of unilateral nuclear disarmament&#x2014;which see the peril of the nation, clearly are now gaining such widespread support throughout the country. Is it not that the nuclear weapon has undergone a subtle change, and that if it ever was a deterrent it is no longer so? It has now become something that unless we stop it, or pull it back to the point at which it was a deterrent, will lead to the destruction of us all.<lb/>
I am asking only for a crumb and it is a crumb which all those I have mentioned I believe would welcome. It must surely appeal to patriotic Conservatives. It is merely the reassertion of the power of the Government to control our fate. I do not want cruise missiles here at all. I shall give every possible support to the Greenham Common women and everyone else who seeks to oppose their arrival. Even those who are opposed to these methods surely will say, "Let us have this issue out within our own borders. Let us be the people who decide what is to be our own fate". Even in respect of the nuclear weapons already here&#x2014;not only the cruise which are coming; we already have plenty of American nuclear weapons here&#x2014;we must surely exercise our right of physical operational control to ensure, to support and, if necessary, to enforce the political control which we are said to enjoy.<lb/>
Will the Government now agree that it is urgent to establish British operational control over all nuclear weapons in this country? That urgency is an aspect of technological advance in the nuclear age, an aspect of the increase in the horrifying power of nuclear weapons and of human ingenuity in the means of delivering destruction and death. We have to change our operational systems to cope with that technological advance or we shall be destroyed.<lb/>
The Government must move in this matter. If they do not, much support will be withdrawn from them. It is no good arguing that arrangements made in earlier and simpler times are adequate for today. They are not. We are in peril, and if the Government do not recognise it and decide that our fate must be firmly in our own hands, they will not deserve to retain their support in the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00392">6.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00393"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins opened by saying that he would speak in a conciliatory and non-controversial manner on two very narrow issues&#x2014;the issue of the number of American bases in this country and the issue of dual safety-catches on missiles. For several minutes the noble Lord stuck to his good resolutions; but, as the speech developed more familiarly, we had an attack in
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0035"/>
<col>53</col>
the broadest way on the American bases, on missiles and on cruise missiles in particular.<lb/>
I propose not to follow the noble Lord on the broader questions, but to make a few comments on the two specific questions that he raised. I am very glad to follow him, particularly because of his kind tribute to me as a man of peace&#x2014;a tribute which will give me much to think about&#x2014;and also because he and I were members of Labour Governments which warmly welcomed the presence of American nuclear bases in the country. When I think back I am quite sure that Clem Attlee, Ernest Bevin and Nye Bevan, Hugh Gaitskell and James Callaghan, all those who warmly welcomed these American bases, would say today that they were right so to do. The nuclear presence has been successful, in as much as we have never come within a remote distance of ever having to operate from the bases. I am sure that if they were here tonight they would say that the problem has not changed as we have not changed our minds. What has changed is our Labour Party. That is what they would say and they would be right. That has been the essential change in the situation we have today.<lb/>
The Labour Party is in opposition, it has no control over its extreme Left and therefore it commits itself to the removal of American bases within the lifetime of a Labour Government, if one is elected. It does not oppose of course the Western nuclear deterrent. It can see completely that unilateral nuclear disarmament in the West would concede military supremacy worldwide to the Soviet Union, and the Labour Party does not want that. That is perfectly clear. What it says is that the West needs a nuclear deterrent but that Britain must have no part in it. That is the Labour Party's position. It is hard to see how one could devise a more illogical and morally ambiguous defence policy than that.<lb/>
There are of course non-nuclear nations in NATO; but, unlike them, Britain has contributed to the Western deterrent by providing these bases in the past. To withdraw them now, to throw more responsibilities on to our allies, to incur&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;their resentment and mistrust, would divide and weaken the alliance and that is certainly not acceptable to my noble friends and me on these Benches. If it is morally right for the West to have a nuclear deterrent, why is it morally wrong for the British to help in it? That is a question we should like to hear answered from the Front Bench tonight.<lb/>
I thought that the noble Lord was on stronger ground when he spoke about the need for dual control over these missiles. Here I should like to ask some questions of the Government. We know already the broad line of the Government's defence. It stands on the 1952 agreement which conferred joint political control on the Americans and the British over the firing of these missiles; joint political control not accompanied by joint physical control. The Government assert that joint political control is enough. But one or two doubts must creep in. I put to the Government that it was after 1952 that joint physical control was imposed on a series of missiles, such as the Thor, the Lance and the Honest Johns. If joint political control was enough then why did we have joint physical control over a number of missiles? I also ask the Government about the costs that they say this
<col>54</col>
proposal would incur. The cost of actually technically safeguarding the missiles with dual safety catches is negligible. The actual cost of doing the job is not in dispute.<lb/>
The Government take the line that we would have to buy all the missiles. On March 1st in the House of Commons the Secretary of State for Defence declared that it would cost us &#x00A3;1,000 million, the assumption being I suppose that, although the project would be a joint project, the Americans would pay nothing towards it. Is that the assumption of the Government? If so, it is simply ridiculous; and we should like to know the answer to that question. And we should like to know whether it has ever been discussed with the Americans. When I asked in a parliamentary Question about discussions between the two Governments on this issue, I was told, no; that since the Government took over they have not specifically discussed the question of the cost of putting dual safety catches on these missiles.<lb/>
I suggest that they should discuss it with the Americans quite urgently. I think that they might well find that President Reagan will be willing to pay at least a substantial part&#x2014;if not perhaps the whole cost&#x2014;of this operation. Fortunately, it is extremely unlikely that the provision of dual safety catches will ever have any operational importance. But it has importance in the sense of raising questions of sovereignty, and raising questions of equality of partnership. I think that for the British it involves questions of self-respect and, in the case of the Americans, I think that common sense and courtesy would lead them to adopt this proposal. I think therefore that the Government need to answer some of the questions raised by the noble Lord. I think that they are wrong to dismiss this proposal out of hand, as they have done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00395"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, for putting down his Unstarred Question and for his initial good intention about being non-contentious and confining himself closely to it. I shall speak on an even narrower front then either of the noble Lords who have spoken so far; that is, solely about the joint control of the cruise missiles. I think that, beforehand, the House will not need me to repeat that I do not go along with Lord Jenkins's broader view of NATO's defence policy, which I conceive to be more or less the official view of the Labour Party at the moment; but that we on these Benches go along much more closely with a view which we think is better considered. That is the view expressed by the Labour Front Bench in this House and which we hope to hear expressed again this evening&#x2014;the official Labour view being, of course, that Russia should become the only country with nuclear weapons in Europe. With this, we cannot agree.<lb/>
Let us go back to the origins of the present difficulties about dual control of cruise missiles. Once upon a time there was an understanding between Britain and America about the joint decision to be taken before any strategic weapons were to be launched from this country. I think that the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0036"/>
<col>55</col>
understanding grew up during the Second World War. I am not too clear about it and anything that the Government can say to help this afternoon will be good. But we know that there was an understanding because in January 1952 there was a joint British-United States communiqu&#x00E9; which said:
<quote>"We reaffirm the understanding that the use of these bases"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, US bases in Britain&#x2014;
<quote>"in an emergency would be a matter for joint decision".</quote>
So there we have an understanding reaffirmed in a communiqu&#x00E9;. It is not a very formal arrangement yet, is it? It is an understanding that we do not know about, reaffirmed in a communiqu&#x00E9; which we can all read.<lb/>
In February 1958, a slightly higher degree of formality was introduced into the arrangements. There was a memorandum. It was a memorandum on the supply of ballistic missiles by the United States to the United Kingdom, and it said:
<quote>"The decision to launch these missiles will be a matter for joint decision by the two governments".</quote>
I do not know how a decision can be a matter for joint decision. I do not know whether that sentence is synonymous with the clear English sentence which would run: "The decision to launch these missiles will be a joint one by the two governments". Maybe that was just bad drafting or maybe it conceals a shade of meaning which escapes us. In any case, I think that the House should note that we have proceeded from an understanding, an unpublished understanding, through a communiqu&#x00E9; to a memorandum&#x2014;not a memorandum of agreement, not a treaty. That is what governs the matter at this moment.<lb/>
The intrinsic question is not difficult to understand; it is not difficult to distinguish. I emphasise the fact that it is not difficult to distinguish because the Government always seem to give slightly the impression that it is difficult to distinguish and that those who are not instantly in agreement with their point of view are being slow to make the relevant distinction. It is not difficult to distinguish between weapons systems with one safety catch and weapons systems with two or more safety catches. On the one hand, are shotguns&#x2014;well known to all of us, I think&#x2014;which have one safety catch. On the other hand, are almost all the more complex weapons systems which have two or more safety catches. Once there are physically two or more safety catches on a weapons system&#x2014;that is to say, once physical actions by two or more persons are required to launch it&#x2014;the question arises: who shall those persons be?<lb/>
We know that in the control of our own nuclear weapons it has always been two or more; we know that in the control of purely United States nuclear weapons in the United States, it has always been two or more. I do not think that the Government can possibly tell us if the cruise missiles are not going to require two or more persons to launch them, in any case. We are talking, of course, about the question of why one of those persons should not be British.<lb/>
The Government are apparently frightened to permit the expected debate on all this in the House of Commons, no doubt because of the pressure for dual-key control of the American cruise missiles which they
<col>56</col>
expect from their own Back-Benchers. In this, I think that the Government's credibility is at stake. This evening may, in fact, be the last occasion for them to say anything on the subject before a general election. So far, the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, and his colleagues have failed to answer, or have fudged the answer to, two main questions. The first is this: what will be the cost to Britain of a dual key for the cruise missiles without transferring their ownership to us? It is not compatible with sovereignty that, having lent our soil as a launching pad, we should be without a finger on the safety catch of these weapons.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bestead, last failed to give me an answer to this question an April 21st, and, before that, on March 22nd. Since 1981, the Government have been maintaining or implying that it would be unthinkable for us to have a finger on the safety catch without buying the missile system. Indeed, they have been putting up a rearguard action on the dual key question ever since the SDP was founded.<lb/>
The second question concerns authority in the United States to launch nuclear weapons, including the cruise missiles in Britain. If the President and Vice-President are incapacitated or absent, where does that authority devolve under the United States Constitution&#x2014;to the speaker of the House of Representatives? That is not a fanciful question. There was confusion and panic when President Reagan was shot. This is a separate question. How far down the line does the President of the United States have the right to devolve this authority in the ordinary course of events&#x2014;to the Secretary of Defense, to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to SACEUR, to another general, to a colonel, to a major? When I last asked this question here, the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, seemed to think this was a matter of etiquette and answered that it would not be appropriate to inquire.<lb/>
In evading their duty to answer these questions, the Government like to claim that ground-launched cruise missiles are no different from the United States bombers and submarines that use British bases, concerning which arrangements have been accepted by all parties as satisfactory. But missiles are different in two ways: first, they cannot be recalled when they have been launched and, secondly, they are launched from British soil. The weapons carried by the bombers and submarines would not be launched from British air space or British waters. Thor was the only land-based nuclear missile we have had on British soil until now, and it was indeed under dual key.<lb/>
If the Prime Minister does not decide for a June election, this House may, I think, wish to take up the suggestion put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Shinwell, on 21st April that there should be a vote here. But if she does decide for a June election, then the Government must realise that, if they do not answer these questions tonight, their next opportunity for doing so will be when they meet an electorate, 92 per cent. of whom want the dual key.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00397"><member>Lord Milford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first of all. I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, for giving this opportunity for us to ask the Government several very important questions. With the smears of the Secretary of State for Defence flying about, I shall
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0037"/>
<col>57</col>
have to declare a vested interest, I think. First of all, I am a Communist because I want to be in the front rank of getting Socialism in this country. Secondly, I am a member of the CND and hoping to achieve the security of the British people through its policies.<lb/>
The situation is very dangerous. There are mad cold-war warriors around: they could easily slip into disaster for mankind. At the risk of being labelled a "Kremlin stooge", while following what is happening&#x2014;or rather, not happening&#x2014;in Geneva, I remind myself that Russia has been invaded several times in recent history, suffering appalling loss. So the idea of security to them must be a tremendous issue&#x2014;far more than it is for us&#x2014;while Britain and America have been free from invasion in modern history.<lb/>
These American bases we have been talking about mean that Britain will now be in the front line, holding back any war on American soil. Britain, by piling up more and more American arms and bases in this country, will certainly become one of the first targets if war breaks out. Our present Government welcome more and more deadly weapons in this country when enough already exist to blow mankind out of existence.<lb/>
I went to Greenham Common at Easter and it gave me a very great experience. First of all, I have never been in such an atmosphere of open friendliness, with everybody treating one as a warm friend. Secondly, it was amazing how they kept to non-violence. Everything was greeted with the best of possible tempers and smiles. Thirdly, there was the bravery and the sanity of those remarkable women. I felt the whole set-up was giving a new dimension, a spiritual dimension, to politics. This is happening in every country and I think we have to learn from it. This is the hope for the future, because they are based on realism while at the present moment the leaders of mankind are madmen. So let us stop and come back to friendship and sanity.<lb/>
Faced with this fast-growing movement, the Government's Secretary of State for Defence will not step into the arena and discuss and debate with those who do not agree with him. Instead he stays on the sidelines and throws mud like any street hooligan. It is imperative for mankind that the Geneva talks succeed in lessening the madness in the world.<lb/>
As regards Geneva, there is one question which seems to be holding progress up, and I do not know the answer. I should like to ask the Government this question, and I hope the Minister will give us the answer. I am not trying to make any propaganda: I just do want to know the answer because the question is being asked by people up and down the country. It is the question regarding the French and British nuclear weapons. This seems to be holding up the Geneva discussions. Seriously and honestly, I do not understand why they do not count as part of NATO's total armament. Will the Minister explain once and for all, so that the country can know? We and France are part of NATO: we and they do not conceal that their weapons and ours are directed against the Soviet Union. Would it not be more honest to count them in when talking about parity in armaments on each side? Again, I am not a "Kremlin mole". I want to know the
<col>58</col>
answers, because this really is holding up progress in Geneva which is so essential.<lb/>
Geneva must be the beginning of total nuclear disarmament, the beginning of a sane world. If disarmament and peace were achieved, the world could look forward to new horizons of happiness, spending billions and billions on everyone's welfare, instead of on more and more appalling arms. Everyone knows this. I know it is a platitude, but we do not settle down to try and get it. I do not feel that our Defence Minister's antics depict him and the Government as having a sincere determination to obtain such a world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00398">6.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00399"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure we are all indebted to my noble friend Lord Jenkins of Putney for giving us the opportunity to debate this life-and-death matter of nuclear weapons to be based on United Kingdom soil. He began by saying that there was a good deal of goodwill on this matter. In view of the limited terms of the Question, he said he did not seek to "castigate"&#x2014;that was the word he used&#x2014;on this occasion, but only to interrogate. It is also a good thing, and to the credit of our democracy, that we can debate these issues here, or, indeed at Greenham Common. Long may it continue, although, of course, we hope that we shall get some more answers to the questions which have already been detailed by noble Lords tonight.<lb/>
As my noble friend has said, it is not a matter of whether one takes a unilateral or a multilateral line. The noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, teases&#x2014;if that is the right word&#x2014;my colleagues and myself, because he says that our views have changed. Of course, it is not the views that have changed but the circumstances, because nuclear weapons are now far more deadly than in 1952 when the agreement, which the Government say is adequate, was arrived at. We are concerned not only about the questions which my noble friend has tabled tonight, but also about the situation which may eventually prevent any weapons from being located on our soil. Of course, I refer to the Geneva talks and it may well be that the Minister will say very briefly what progress has been made there and what are the chances of the cruise weapons not coming here, as the Government anticipate, in December next. This is a matter of concern not only to us but to other members of the NATO alliance.<lb/>
For some time, as we all know, members of political parties in both Houses of Parliament and in the country have shown a deep concern about the need for dual control of weapons based here. This concern is widespread, particularly among those who accept the basing of nuclear weapons on our soil. It is rather surprising that those who support Government policy are not more strident in their demands for the guarantees which have been demanded here this evening.<lb/>
Britain, the Prime Minister says, should not be pushed around. She said that about the Falklands which are 8,000 miles away, yet here, in the control of events on our own soil affecting our own people, the same principle does not apply, because the distinct impression in this matter is that in any emergency situation the United States will be entirely responsible
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0038"/>
<col>59</col>
for our destiny. So we demand that the United Kingdom should not be pushed around and that we should control the nuclear weapons, if they have to be based here, because of the devastating effect that they can have not only upon the lives of millions of people here now, but upon generations yet unborn.<lb/>
In the other place only last week my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition pressed, as he has done for some time, to have a debate on these issues as well as on defence and disarmament policy generally. We believe that, if the USA is to be in sole charge of the bases here, we need to know much more about the President's thinking on a number of issues and his commitment on major defence and foreign policy issues. This is not an anti-American sentiment, but clearly if the Americans are to have such control over our destiny we need to know more about their thinking and, what is most important, we need to be consulted on matters which will affect us.<lb/>
In recent debates in your Lordships' House not only has concern been expressed on all sides, but a lack of clarity, and indeed a vagueness, has been shown by Ministers about the policy of the Government. I believe that the time has come&#x2014;in fact, it is long overdue&#x2014;for the Government to be quite clear about their policy. With the Prime Minister&#x2014;it may not be this Prime Minister; it may be another&#x2014;going to conferences at Williamsburg and elsewhere, Parliament has a right to know about the issues being discussed and the policy issues which the Government are likely to pursue. So those who support Government policy ought to be no less demanding about the dual control and the other safeguards&#x2014;matters on which there has been confusion and uncertainty from the Government for some time.<lb/>
The issues have been of particular concern in Parliament, as is clear from the <i>Official Reports</i> of both Houses in the last few months. In this House on 18th January, the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, assured us that,
<quote>"The use of United States bases in the United Kingdom in an emergency"&#x2014;</quote>
including, of course, missile bases&#x2014;
<quote>"was to be a matter for joint decision by Her Majesty's Government and the United States Government, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report;</i> col. 1286].</quote>
Later, in column 1288, he is quoted as saying:
<quote>"A dual key arrangement would entail the United Kingdom purchasing the missiles and supporting equipment, except the warheads, and manning them in the same way as we do the Lance missiles in Germany".</quote>
So there will obviously be no operational control of these weapons.<lb/>
On 1st February last in another place, the Secretary of State Mr. Heseltine said at column 133 of the <i>Official Report,</i> when asked about arrangements for the use of cruise missiles, that there would be a joint decision by the American and British Governments. He went on to say:
<quote>"There was no case for the additional strain on the defence budget that would have been imposed by buying the cruise platform systems, when they would be fully protected under the arrangements that were on offer".</quote>
So, again, the Government stress that there will be no dual control, and presumably the actual firing will be
<col>60</col>
done by members of the United States Army Air Force. We believe it is not enough to say that we hope, in the almost panic situation which could prevail at that time, that there will be no mistake, no error&#x2014;because millions of lives could be at stake.<lb/>
The Government tell us repeatedly that the arrangements have been in existence for 30 years, so we have no need to worry, and the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, reminded us that the agreement was made under other Governments. But, as I said a moment ago, the situation is far more dangerous than it was then, and the concern which I and my noble friends share about the consequences of the Government's policy is shared by many others. The arrangements which were formulated all that time ago were, of course, for subsonic aircraft and free-fall bombs and, as a Member of the other place said recently, they are wholly inappropriate for dispersed missiles with sophisticated triggers and targeting. These are the factors which are causing growing concern in the country.<lb/>
As I said, the important point is that modern nuclear weapons and cruise missiles are far more lethal and their mechanisms are far more intricate and sensitive than ever before. That is why the Labour Party believes that the arrangements of 1952 are quite unrealistic and inadequate in this situation. A firing, whether intended or not, would invite massive nuclear retaliation. More concern was expressed in the debate in the other place on 7th February, and of course there has been widespread concern in the country, not only in CND but in the Churches, as well as at the meetings at Uppsala in Sweden only a few days ago between the Churches and the bishops of the United States. So there is growing widespread concern, and it is no good for the Secretary of State for Defence to suggest that those who doubt the Government's policy are to be considered sinister and fellow travellers, because that will not do.<lb/>
In this House on 16th February, at column 329 of the <i>Official Report,</i> the Minister said that the estimated costs to the United Kingdom of providing 160 ground-launched cruise missiles with the dual key system would be of the order of &#x00A3;1,000 million of capital expenditure, with annual running costs of tens of millions of pounds. The fact is that the cruise missiles&#x2014;which are, as I said, due to come here from December, unless some satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at in Geneva and elsewhere&#x2014;would be dispersed around the country, with all the added complications of communications which that would entail.<lb/>
The Minister should tell the House whether the views of Admiral La Rocque, a former high-ranking officer of the Pentagon, which were expressed in an ITV programme on 28th February, have been considered by the Government. He claimed that nobody in Europe could stop the USA from firing its nuclear weapons system from this country. These are the aspects which add to the concern of many millions of people. I would ask the Minister to answer another questions. If cruise missiles can be launched from any area of the United Kingdom, what real control will there be?<lb/>
I believe also, on the issue of nuclear weapons and conventional capabilities, that another major fear in
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0039"/>
<col>61</col>
the minds of many people is that the enormous cost of nuclear weapons&#x2014;of cruise, of the dual key arrangement, of Trident and maybe of dual key for Trident as well, plus the Falkland defence liability&#x2014;will be far more than we can afford. This view has been expressed by noble Lords on all sides of the House, and indeed by honourable and right honourable Members on both sides in another place. The danger is that should we go nuclear early on, the huge cost of nuclear weapons would reduce our conventional capability to the extent that conventional weapons might be completely inadequate in any situation. That is the real fear which causes grave concern to so many.<lb/>
The United Kingdom needs to know, in terms of the Question tabled by my noble friend, why the Government have been reluctant to reveal the American nuclear and other bases that there are in this country and whether the Government will establish operational control over nuclear weapons at such bases. Even more important, the Government need to have wise and meaningful defence policies and to come to agreement in international talks with the Soviet Union and with others about improved relationships so that conventional, not nuclear, weapons may lower the fear striking mankind. Success at Geneva and in other international talks which could result in the use of nuclear weapons or bases being unnecessary would remove the clouds of war which haunt mankind at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00400">6.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00401"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, should ask this Question this evening for, far from being a source of anxiety, the presence of United States forces in this country is a source of strength and reassurance for the defence and security of our country. There has therefore been no attempt to conceal the facts, as the noble Lord suggests. The arrangements for the control of any use to which these forces might be put are wholly satisfactory, and that has been the case since United States forces returned to Britain after the 1939&#x2013;45 war.<lb/>
Western Europe is faced with Russian military power. The Soviet Union makes no secret of its readiness to use force and on more than one occasion it has shown that it will prevent by force any attempt by the people of Eastern Europe to recover their lost liberty. That is why Britain has been a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation since 1949. That is why successive Governments have regarded the alliance as the cornerstone of our defence. For over 30 years NATO has prevented aggression. The success of this policy of deterrence hinges on the determination of all the NATO countries to stand together, to treat a threat to one as a threat to all. Above all, it is vital that the defence of the United States is identified with the defence of its NATO allies. It is for this reason, strengthened of course by our cultural and historical ties and by our comradeship against tyranny in days gone by, that successive British Governments have welcomed the stationing of United States forces in Britain.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, was a Minister in previous Labour Governments. At no
<col>62</col>
point in his speech did the noble Lord reveal why it is that he and his party are now apparently proposing to withdraw facilities offered to the United States for the past 30 years and so to withhold much of our contribution to the collective defence of NATO. It was left to the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, to say that the Labour Party has changed its mind. On the evidence of Soviet aggression across the world, that change of mind is I believe wholly irresponsible.<lb/>
The noble Lord's Question also reflects allegations which are wholly without foundation. Those allegations are that the United States presence in this country is growing and that this is somehow being concealed by Her Majesty's Government. In his speech, the noble Lord went on to say that his assessment was that there are between 100 and 150 United States bases in the United Kingdom. The fact is that eight main operating bases are being used by the United States in this country. These are at Holy Loch, RAF Alconbury, RAF Bentwaters, RAF Fairford, RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Woodbridge. Over 95 per cent. of the United States forces personnel based here work at these main locations and at the three standby deployment bases. That fact alone gives, I hope, a proper perspective to this matter.<lb/>
It is indeed the case that supporting these main bases there are a number of other facilities, but as the Government have made clear on a number of occasions, even taking into account such things as storage hangars, the total list is close to 60 and not between 100 and 150. This has been made perfectly clear in answer to Questions in another place. The noble Lord mentioned the Answer of 8th June 1980 when the number of United States bases was given.<lb/>
The Answer made clear that there were other facilities. These were named in succeding Answers to Questions about bases not manned or facilities for storage or logistic support. I shall not go into detail about individual bases which the noble Lord ascribed to use by United States personnel, except to say that there is nothing in what the noble Lord suggested with regard to Oakhanger and Prestwick. They are not American bases. That the Port of Liverpool should be alleged to be a major United States terminal is one of the most extraordinary things that I have heard suggested for a long time. By no stretch of the imagination can an office at Liverpool which processes shipping documentation warrant a description of that kind. Indeed, of the bases named in some of the newspaper articles which have been published, no fewer than eight of the facilities listed were handed back by the United States forces long before they were indentified as such. The noble Lord will forgive me if I say that I sometimes wonder whether he and those who think like him have first thought up the number of 100 or more and then tried to justify it. I hope that what I have said will rectify the false allegations which have been made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00402"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on a point of accuracy, in view of what the noble Lord has just said, how does he justify the gradual revelation of the existence of more and more American nuclear bases? The Minister himself gave a figure of eight bases, whereas he knows that his noble friend has already
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0040"/>
<col>63</col>
admitted to the existence of over 70. How does the Minister justify this figure, first arriving at 12 and then finishing up with something approaching 100? Is it not the case that since the Government have been inaccurate in the past we can reasonably expect them to be inaccurate in the present?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00403"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can easily answer that question. How delightful it is to take part in a debate when it is easy to answer a question. The answer to the noble Lord is, no. Turning to the second part of the noble Lord's Question as to operational control over United States nuclear weapons based in this country, this is a matter to which all post-war British Governments have directed their attention. This, I accept, is a matter of concern to noble Lords and I shall try to give answers to the questions which have been put. Arrangements for the control of American forces based in the United Kingdom were first agreed by Mr. Attlee and President Truman in 1951. As your Lordships know, that agreement was endorsed by Mr. Churchill and President Truman in further discussions in 1952. The understanding which these two leaders reached was summarised in a joint communiqu&#x00E9; published at the time. The text reads as follows:
<quote>"Under arrangements made for the common defence, the United States has the use of certain bases in the United Kingdom. We reaffirm the understanding that the use of these bases in an emergency would be a matter for joint decision by Her Majesty's Government and the United States Government in the light of the circumstances at the time".</quote>
This understanding has applied, although of course it has been looked at every time a new Prime Minister or a new President has taken office, throughout the period from 1951 and applies with equal force today.<lb/>
All successive Prime Ministers and Presidents have reaffirmed the understanding, all judging it to be satisfactory. Most recently the arrangement has been reviewed by the Prime Minister and President Reagan in February 1981. The Prime Minister has said in another place that she is satisfied that these arrangements are effective. The understanding applies to the bases for all United States forces in this country, both conventional and nuclear, and it will apply to the 160 United States ground-launched cruise missiles, the first of which are due to be deployed here from the end of 1983 if there is no prior agreement in Geneva to abolish this class of missile.<lb/>
If I may say this to the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, who revealed that he was particularly concerned about it, this understanding means in effect that the use of nuclear weapons is subject to joint decision. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, made great play with the distinction he drew between political and operational control. It would be a matter for the elected Governments involved to make decisions of such awesome importance. That is why this Government, like its predecessors, believe that this understanding between the two Governments is of overriding importance.<lb/>
Had we so chosen, cruise missiles could have been deployed here on a dual key system, whereby we bought and operated the missiles while the United States retained custody of the warhead. Previous Governments have not considered such measures necessary for the physical control of the United States Air Force F111 's, which have, of course, been
<col>64</col>
operating from this country for many years, and during the whole time of the two Labour Governments. I would emphasise that there is no precedent for a dual key system except on the basis of ownership. The noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, and the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, raised this point recently and again this evening. I have to repeat to both noble Lords that a dual key system is the basis on which we operate the Lance missile and nuclear-capable artillery deployed with our army in Germany. It was the basis on which we operated the Thor missile system, which was stationed in this country in the early 1960s. But it is done on the basis of ownership of the launchers.<lb/>
Against the background of our relationship with the United States and our confidence in the long-established arrangements governing the use of United States forces based in this country, we concluded that to apply different arrangements from those which already existed, which I have just outlined, would add nothing to the effectiveness of the cruise missiles as a deterrent force, and would divert substantial resources from the enhancement of our conventional and independent nuclear capabilities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00404"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate the noble Lord giving way. I was about to intervene to make the point the noble Lord made, that under the 1952 agreement there was dual control of the Thor missile. Now, of course, the Minister says you cannot expect it on cruise because it is not owned by us but jointly owned. Surely, it we are allies working together in any emergency there is just as much case for us to have dual control in the present situation as there was previously in the case of Thor&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00405"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect, I do not think that the noble Lord has perhaps quite added to the light which is being shed on this subject, which is not an entirely easy subject. The 1952 agreement is the agreement which I have read out, and that in effect gives joint political decision. The arrangement with the Thor missiles, with respect to the noble Lord, was an arrangement for full dual key, because the Thor launchers were owned by the United Kingdom. What I have just been saying is that that is the arrangement for full dual key, and only that arrangement, based on ownership, has always been accepted both by the United States and those who are the allies of the United States. For that reason, unless we were prepared to purchase the cruise missiles, we should not be able to claim full dual key. We felt that this would divert substantial resources from money which we should otherwise be spending on our conventional and other nuclear capabilities. In these circumstances, the Government decided that the arrangements summarised in the 1952 communiqu&#x00E9; should apply to the cruise missile force.<lb/>
The 1952 understanding is of long standing: it is firmly founded in the close co-operation which we share with our staunch NATO ally. It has stood the test of time; it has provided a framework which successive Governments of both parties have found entirely satisfactory. And it is a symbol to a potential aggressor of the strength and cohesion of NATO measured by the mutual trust which exists between Britain and the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0041"/>
<col>65</col>
United States within the Western Alliance. As such, it provides a significant contribution to the capacity of NATO to sustain its policy of deterrence.<lb/>
I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, that those who would consider changing the arrangements should weigh carefully the consequences of their actions. The Soviet Union must be in no doubt as to the absolute mutual confidence and trust between the NATO partners, which has been the foundation of the alliance since its inception. There must be no room to doubt our determination collectively to stand together in defence of our common aims. After all, NATO threatens no one, but the NATO policy of deterrence has ensured the longest period of peace in Europe for longer than anyone can remember. Our deterrence strategy works precisely because the resources of the members of the alliance are joined together for the common good. The presence of United States forces in this country and in other parts of Europe is crucial to this. So we welcome the United States presence in Britain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00406"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder if the noble Lord would allow me to ask him a question, which is asked in a most constructive spirit. Why did Mr. Macmillan buy the Thor Missiles?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00407"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot answer that question, although I will no doubt look it up. But I do not think this takes our debate very much further. The fact of the matter is that Thor was under a dual key&#x2014;there is no secret about that&#x2014;because the launchers were owned by Britain. The fact of the matter is that the decision had to be taken by the Government at the present time as to whether they were prepared to purchase the cruise missile launchers. That would have taken a very large sum of money, and I have already given an assessment of it in previous Questions in your Lordships' House. And, for reasons which I have already deployed in my speech, the Government felt that it was not right to go for a dual key decision on cruise but to rest on the effective arrangements of the joint political decision procedure which is encapsulated in the 1952 Memorandum.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00408"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is very good of the noble Lord to be so kind as to give way again. May I ask him to clarify this point? I believe he is telling us&#x2014;I hope he is not&#x2014; that the trust between ourselves and the United States is worth so little that they will not concede a dual key arrangement unless we are prepared to buy the launchers from them. If that is the nature of the trust between us and the United States at this time it is not so good as it was during the last war, and it is not worth much.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00409"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is not only capable of not following the argument I am trying to put forward, but I think the noble Lord is even capable of not listening. The last few minutes of the speech I have been submitting to your Lordships&#x2014;before I gave way to the noble Lord, Lord Kennet&#x2014;have been entirely directed to making the case that the joint political decision procedure rests upon mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual confidence. We need to be able to show the United States, Britain and all the allies in NATO that we have this mutual trust and
<col>66</col>
confidence and to leave the Soviet Union, in particular, under no misapprehension that this mutual trust and confidence exists.<lb/>
I ask the noble Lord to try, just for once, to stick to the facts of the case. In this speech, the noble Lord took it upon himself, in the third period of 10 minutes in what is supposed to be a short debate, to regale the House with a wholly inaccurate argument about cruise missiles being first strike weapons. I wonder whether the noble Lord has ever considered, just for one moment, that the huge number of strategic ballistic missiles held by the Soviet Union would make such a policy for cruise entirely impracticable&#x2014;and that is to leave aside entirely the fact that the NATO alliance is a defensive alliance which has never, and will never, strike first at an enemy.<lb/>
I said at the beginning of my speech that I expressed surprise at the terms of this Question and I remain of the same view, for it seems wholly to disregard all that NATO has achieved and all that NATO still has to do. The spirit of co-operation which brought the countries of Western Europe to stand together against the military threat from the Soviet Union has stood the test of time. This is due, not least, to the fact that the alliance is a free association of nations joined together to defend the liberties of their people. I repeat, it is an alliance based on mutual trust and mutual beliefs.<lb/>
Today, while remaining strong and vigilant, NATO is also working for a reduction in forces both nuclear and conventional. In each of the three disarmament negotiations the West has put forward proposals for genuine and significant arms reductions and in each case we await a matching response which would show that the Soviet Union is also working for balanced reductions which would increase stability between East and West. But, perhaps most important of all, it is now up to the Soviet Union to decide whether any cruise missiles need to be deployed in Western Europe from the end of this year. The noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, asked specifically about this. If the Russians are prepared to dismantle their own such weapons, NATO would be very ready and only too happy not to proceed with its own deployment. We should then have taken a significant step towards an agreed reduction in arms; a step which would be vital to the cause of peace.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00410"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down would he be so courteous as to answer another question? Has he noticed that he has failed to address himself to the two questions which I asked, or has he a reason for failing to do so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00411"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not mean to be discourteous to the noble Lord. The first question that the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, addressed to me was: why is it not possible to have a dual key system without needing to have ownership, but by having some form of British presence in the line of command?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00412"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00413"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will forgive me, I cannot keep bobbing up and down. I am replying to the two questions which he says I have not answered. In effect, I have replied to the question by
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0042"/>
<col>67</col>
going into great detail about the reasons why ownership underlies dual key.<lb/>
The second question which the noble Lord asked was about authority in the United States to launch. If the noble Lord will acquit me of discourtesy, I answered that in the space of three long columns in <i>Hansard</i> on 23rd March.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00414"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that was not the question I asked. I know that it is customary only to ask questions but may I repeat the question, with the leave of the House? How much would it cost us to have a dual key arrangement without buying the missiles? That is a different question. I should like to have an answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00415"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have answered that question on more than one occasion in the past. We have not gone into that because the question does not arise for the reasons that I have given during the debate this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00416"><member>Lord Milford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I repeat the question I asked? Why are French and British arms not counted in trying to get parity in Geneva?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00417"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, here again, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Milford, because I know that that it is a perfectly genuine question. It is, however, a question that has been answered on many occasions in both Houses of Parliament. The short answer is that the talks in Geneva are bilateral talks between the Soviet Union and the United States and it does not do to change the rules in the middle of negotiations.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00419"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00420">Whether following the case of <i>Regina</i> versus <i>Turner, Terroni and Brown</i> at the Central Criminal Court, they will make a statement on interference with a juror in connection with that trial, what action was taken during and following the trial by the police, how many officers were involved, and what further action will be taken to deal with improper approaches to jurors at the Central Criminal Court and elsewhere.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00421"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member>: I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that the case of <i>Regina</i> versus <i>Turner, Terroni and Brown</i> was interrupted on 7th April 1983 when the Judge ordered the jurors to be given police protection following a complaint by a member of the jury that he had received an approach concerning the case.</p>
<col>68</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00422">Seventy-eight police officers were provided to give 24-hour protection to the jury. At the conclusion of the trial on 18th April, 1983, a police investigation into the approach to the juror was commenced and this is continuing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00423">In recent months discussions have taken place between the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Home Office, representatives of the Commissioners of the Metropolitan and the City of London Police and the Courts Administrator at the Central Criminal Court on all aspects of interference with juries with a view to reducing the opportunities for illegal approaches.</p>

<li>(<i>a</i>) members of the prison service and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) others</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<title>DETENTION OF PRISONERS: COSTS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00427"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00428">Whether they will indicate whether it is cheaper to keep prisoners in police cells rather than in prison.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00429"><member>Lord Elton</member>: The cost of keeping a prisoner in police custody in the Metropolitan Police District is not assessed on a <i>per capita</i> basis, but in recent months has averaged about &#x00A3;100 a night. The average weekly cost of keeping a prisoner in a local prison or remand centre in 1981&#x2013;82, the most recent period for which figures are available, was &#x00A3;181. I have placed in the Library a copy of a letter which I have sent to the noble Lord on 14th April explaining the position more fully and correcting an earlier statement I made on this matter which I accept was mistaken.</p>

<title>POLICE INTERVIEWS: TAPE RECORDING</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00430"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00431">Which areas will be participating in the field trials of tape recording police interviews with suspects.</p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0043"/>
<col>69</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00432"><member>Lord Elton</member>: I welcome this opportunity to make a statement about the progress being made towards the establishment of the field trials.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00433">Chief officers of the following police forces have agreed that their forces should participate in the field trials:
<ul>
<li>Metropolitan Police (Holborn and Croydon)</li>
<li>Merseyside (Wirral)</li>
<li>Leicestershire (Leicester Central)</li>
<li>Hampshire (Winchester)</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00434">The chief constable of Northumbria has agreed that a field trial should take place in the South Tyneside Division, provided that the costs of acoustic improvements are acceptable to his police committee My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is naturally grateful to the chief officers of these forces and their police authorities for the readiness they have shown to participate in the field trials. HM Customs and Excise also intend to mount field trials of tape recording. These will take place at the Headquarters of their Investigation Division in London and at Terminal 3, Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00435">The Steering Committee established to devise and oversee the field trials held its second full meeting on 13th April and gave its general approval to draft procedural guidance. This guidance, copies of which will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses as soon as it is finalised, will take the form of operating instructions addressed to the police and other professional participants in the trials.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00436">The main features of the guidance are as follows. All interviews in the police station with persons suspected of indictable offences, triable either way offences or a limited number of summary offences should be tape recorded. The only exception will be where it is not reasonably practicable to record the interview because of mechanical failure or the lack of suitable interview facilities, or where it is clear from the outset that a person will not be prosecuted (e.g. he will be cautioned). The authority of an independent senior officer will be needed before an interview is not recorded. Provision is also made for where a suspect is unwilling to be interviewed while being tape recorded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00437">Two cassette tapes will be recorded simultaneously. One will be treated as an exhibit and the other as a working copy. A police officer may use this copy to write up a note of the interview and a statement of evidence, which will confine themselves to giving an account of those parts of an interview which the officer considers directly relevant in evidential terms to the matters which will be before the court and reflect what the officer is likely to give as his evidence in chief. Provision will be made for access by the defence to the tape before the court hearing and it will be recommended that, notwithstanding the lack of formal arrangements for advance disclosure of the prosecution case, in certain circumstances the defence has served on it in advance the police officer's statement of evidence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00438">It is to be hoped that such procedures will enable defence and prosecution to have the opportunity to come to a measure of prior agreement on the substance of the interview and thus reduce to the minimum the need for transcription. As the Royal Commission's research showed, the frequency of
<col>70</col>
transcription is crucial to the overall cost. Where, however, there is a need for a transcript, provision will be made for prior consideration by the courts and the legal aid committees of the justification for making a transcript so that the party ordering the transcript does not run the risk of having the considerable expense involved disallowed on taxation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00439">Progress has also been made on the identification of equipment and in devising research and monitoring proposals. The Steering Committee has approved a specification for a machine which records, on two cassette tapes simultaneously, which is unobtrusive, robust, reliable and capable of simple operation, and which incorporates a time coded security device. It is too early yet to say when this and other appropriate equipment will be available, but account will be taken in considering manufacturers' tenders of the date by which delivery can be achieved. Surveys are being made of the rooms to be used to advise participating forces of what measures will be necessary to achieve acoustically adequate conditions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00440">As to research, in two areas particular attention will be paid to the impact of tape recording on the courts. To establish comparative data, a pre-trial monitoring period of six months will be undertaken in these areas. It is hoped to begin this work in June. In the other areas the concentration will be on the impact of tape recording on the police, although some analysis of the impact on the courts will also be undertaken. Work is in hand in updating the operational research computer model developed by the Cranfield College of Technology for the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure. The Home Office Research and Planning Unit will also be undertaking a study of the experience of tape recording in other countries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00441">Since the successful introduction of tape recording will depend vitally on a good understanding and co-operation being achieved between the various practitioners involved, the Steering Committee has agreed that local steering arrangements should be established. The intention is that these committees should have a judicial chairman and embrace all the practitioners who will be involved in tape recording at a local level. They will serve essentially as a forum in which to resolve matters which arise locally. My right honourable friend is grateful to the presiding judges of the circuits in which field trials are to take place for their ready agreement to the establishment of such committees and to the members of HM Judiciary who have already been approached in some areas for their agreement to take on the chairmanship of these committees.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00442">In conclusion, I should like to re-emphasise our gratitude to the members of the Steering Committee, and in particular to the representatives of the police service and other professions, for the commitment of time and experience to the development of these proposals for the field trials. The introduction of tape recording raises a great number of issues throughout the criminal justice process and the determination of the Steering Committee to tackle and resolve these matters gives us every confidence that the field trials will be mounted successfully and will achieve their objectives of putting us all in a position to judge the best basis for introducing a national scheme.</p>

<title>Disarmament: Geneva Discussions</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00445"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the first Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00446">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00447">To ask Her Majesty's Government what schedule has been agreed for meetings of the United Nations Committee at Geneva instructed by the Second Special Session to report by 1984 on a comprehensive programme on disarmament; and whether they support the prepared draft for the implementation of disarmament, beginning with the prohibition of nuclear weapons and reduction of conventional weapons in two stages of five years, and a third indefinite stage to plan general and complete disarmament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00448"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no schedule as such but there have been frequent consultations on various sections of the draft. We continue to work towards agreement on the lines of the paper which we and a number of Western states tabled in July 1981.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00449"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister, but is there not some inconsistency in the Government declaring their support for multilateral disarmament when at Geneva and at the United Nations they are continually imposing conditions for such disarmament?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00450"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are not party to the Geneva bilateral talks; but, on the contrary, our NATO allies, the United States, are constantly proposing constructive suggestions for disarmament in both the START and INF talks. As regards the noble Lord's Question on the Order Paper, work is going on in the Committee on Disarmament on an amalgamated draft, but we have always made clear that we believe that the Western draft, which was tabled not only by Britain but by Australia, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan in July 1981, is the most realistic and positive way to proceed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00451"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the Western draft insist on verification? Is it not the case that the Soviet Union has now accepted verification in principle and is prepared to discuss this in its talks with the USA at Geneva? Did not the Government even abstain from a motion that there should be a ban on underground nuclear tests when they stressed the need for verification?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00452"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the question of verification can be agreed by all sides, wherever it may
<col>72</col>
apply, no one would be more pleased than Her Majesty's Government. But the fact of the matter is that the Western draft, to which the noble Lord referred in his supplementary question, was based on a step-by-step approach towards general and complete disarmament, with the first phase being the continuation and, where possible, the conclusion of negotiations currently in progress. It is that step which we have not yet taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00453"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord say what is her Majesty's Government's reaction to the initiative or proposal made by Mr. Andropov in Moscow yesterday, in which he said that the Soviet Union was prepared to consider a reduction of Soviet warheads in Europe provided the American Pershing and cruise missiles were not established in Europe? Did not the proposal also suggest that the number of Soviet war missiles should match those held by France and the United Kingdom? Can the Minister indicate where this proposal would be discussed as a matter of fact? Will this now become part of the discussions at Geneva, and what would be the response of Her Majesty's Government to it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00454"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we believe it could be a step in the right direction and is to be welcomed if it is a signal that the Russians will now begin to negotiate seriously at Geneva. But as regards the assertion that British and French nuclear weapons must be counted in the negotiations, that remains unacceptable to us and our allies. We believe that is a proposal based on a transparently false premise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00455"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister say whether Mr. Andropov's proposal included machinery for verification?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00456"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware that it did.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00457"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord give the House the assurance that it is the hope of the British Government that the Americans will in due course make a positive response to this proposal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00458"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I have covered that in my answer to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, but I shall repeat it in case I did not make myself clear. We believe that it could be a step in the right direction and is to be welcomed if it is a signal that the Russians will begin to negotiate seriously at Geneva.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00459"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister not agree that in so far as it was this nation which helped in the creation of NATO, and bearing in mind that we have been realistic ever since, with these horrendous weapons now in existence ought not the voice of Britain be heard at major disarmament conferences if only to challenge and expose, when necessary, the Soviet Union and to put right some of the errors of our major allies, such as the Americans, so that we, with our background and experience, can make a useful contribution not only to verification itself but to setting the world on the road to disarmament?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0045"/>
<col>73</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00460"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the British voice most certainly is heard in the Committee on Disarmament, from which the Question on the Order Paper springs. It was in a speech on 10th March this year, at the Committee on Disarmament which is meeting in Geneva, that my right honourable friend Mr. Douglas Hurd launched a new British initiative, putting forward proposals to ensure that the parties fulfil their obligations under a future convention on chemical weapons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00461"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware of the astonishment with which I heard him say that Her Majesty's Government were in favour of universal and complete disarmament? Have Her Majesty's Government considered the universal chaos which would occur if nobody was equipped to prevent anything&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00462"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord did not hear aright. I did not say that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00463"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, did not the Minister say that the American response was in the right direction, and would it not be more true to say that the American response was in the wrong direction on this issue?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00464"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with very great respect to the noble Baroness, I did not say that, either.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00465"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the point raised by the noble Lord who suggested that in this matter we should use our power in debate, just how much power in debate would we have if we in fact disarmed unilaterally first?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00466"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Viscount puts his finger on the right point. That is not the policy of Her Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00467"><member>Lord Elystan-Morgan</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since Mr. Andropov's proposal is on any view one of the most significant events since the beginning of the Cold War, in order to show good will and genuineness on the part of Britain in this most crucial issue are Her Majesty's Government prepared to put back the date upon which cruise missiles will be established in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00468"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00469"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord not consider that if the situation were reversed and missiles located in other countries, as well as in the Soviet Union, were targeted upon this country, we would want the weapons located in those other countries to be counted in any international comparison? In these circumstances, is it not entirely reasonable that the Soviet Union should wish to count both French and British nuclear weapons?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00470"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Russian concept of a balance between those weapons which can reach their territory from Western Europe and <i>vice versa</i> conveniently ignores the fact that Western Europe is targeted by an unknown, but doubtless very large,

<title>The Potato Marketing Board</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00473">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00474"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00475">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00476">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are satisfied that the Potato Marketing Board is fulfilling its functions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00477"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00478"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for his reply, which was both brief and probably some unkind people might think typical of the complacency of the Government in the face of disaster. Perhaps he would care to expand it a little. I declare my non-interest. My potatoes are fetching an excellent price, except that they are a third of the price they were last year. I have no interest. I am doing it in the interests of potato growers as a whole. Is the noble Earl aware that many potato producers in Scotland have been taking as low as &#x00A3;32 a tonne for their potatoes, that the Government's low fall-back price is just over &#x00A3;43 and that this has not been realised? Is he also aware that the Potato Marketing Board has spent a great deal of money in its efforts to hold the price at a reasonable level and that it would appear that the Government have refused to give it any more to produce the sort of buying programme which would have held the price at a reasonable level? Are the Government going to continue in this policy? Will they back the Potato Marketing Board and the money they have already spent?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00479"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, for declaring his interest. I think that he said about my answer that it showed complacency in the face of disaster. Possibly the noble Lord's interest might have been so described as well. The noble Lord asked whether the Government were going to back the Potato Marketing Board. They have done so. I would remind him that the United Kingdom cumulative average price for the season, which was &#x00A3;53.43 per tonne, is still comfortably above the level of the guaranteed price, which was &#x00A3;43.94. In that respect, the Government guarantee is working. It is impossible for the Government, or indeed the Potato Marketing Board, to predict with any accuracy the level of prices which will obtain at any one period of time.</membercontribution></p>

<col>75</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00480"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the working of a guarantee which involves a very large number of producers in a loss of money should be looked at so that it may be improved?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00481"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course we will always look at it. But I remind the noble Lord that the particular point of this form of guarantee is that the Potato Marketing Board can buy in up to 600,000 tonnes of potatoes at a specified price. It is only if the market price goes above that that the Potato Marketing Board will release growers from their contract. When it goes below the price the Potato Marketing Board holds to that contract. There are some growers who might have taken advantage of the contract, but did not do so. They cannot therefore blame the Government for that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00482"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must declare a non-interest in potatoes. I do not grow any; I only eat them. Surely this year, when, as the noble Earl knows, we have a great scarcity of fodder, it would have been the Government's duty to help the board to buy in potatoes and release them to the hard-pressed people in the West Country, Wales and elsewhere, who are very short of fodder?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00483"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Potato Marketing Board is already operating a stock feed scheme at &#x00A3;15 a tonne.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00484"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: That is too high, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Libya: Terrorists</title>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00486"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00487">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00488">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have made any representations to the Government of Libya about the deployment reported in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> on 10th April of "Carlo-trained" terrorists in Europe and Africa; and whether they have any information about the numbers to be sent to this country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00489"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have no independent confirmation of these reports, but we have been concerned by Libyan statements to the effect that they still regard violence as an option. The Government have made their views known to the Libyan authorities at a high level in recent months. My honourable friend the Minister for Health discussed the matter in general terms when he was in Tripoli in February. He received assurances to which we attach great importance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00490"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend ensure that the immigration officers are alerted as to the possible arrival of these terrorists, so that they can intercept them and return them to the country from which they came?</membercontribution></p>
<col>76</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00491"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly draw my noble friend's request to the attention of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, who would be responsible for this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00492"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord says that we have no confirmation of this information, which relates to a matter which is so dangerous to our public order. Is he doing anything about getting confirmation or information? How long are we going to go on dealing with assassin states as though they were ordinary, respectable members of the community of nations? They are not; they are public enemies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00493"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have not done what the noble Lord is asking of me, which is to follow up newspaper reports; but I shall state what we have done. After the incidents in 1980 in which, the noble Lord will remember, three Libyans were assassinated in this country, we sought and received assurances that there would be no repetition of such behaviour. We made it very clear that otherwise there could be no future in Anglo-Libyan relations. We attach importance to those assurances, but we have no illusions, and we are watching Libyan actions closely.</membercontribution></p>

<title>UNCTAD VI and the Brandt Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00494">2.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00495"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the second Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00496">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00497">To ask Her Majesty's Government what proposals they intend to make to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in June: and whether they will support the recommendations in <i>Common Crisis,</i> the second report of the Brandt Commission; and the plan of the non-aligned nations for new world economic relations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00498"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for some time we have been preparing for UNCTAD VI with our partners in the European Community and OECD on the basis of policy papers put forward by the UNCTAD secretariat. We shall be ready to discuss all proposals constructively, including those put forward by the non-aligned nations and by the Group of 77 at their meeting in Buenos Aires. The Community position will be decided by the Council of Ministers on 24th May. We welcome the publication of the second report by the Brandt Commission, on which we recently had a short debate in your Lordships' House. We promised to publish a White Paper setting out the Government's position on its recommendations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00499"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while welcoming that reply, may I ask the Minister whether he agrees that there has now been a deadlock between the North and the South for nine years? While endorsing the recommendations of the Brandt second report about immediate aid, may I ask the noble Lord whether he would not agree that it is more fundamentally
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0047"/>
<col>77</col>
important that new economic relations should be established with the developing countries? I ask that question in view of the fact that every year three-fifths of the population of this country in those territories die from hunger and medical neglect, and bearing in mind that the present economic relations are very heavily weighted on the side of the industrialised nations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00500"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord draws attention to the North-South problem. We hope that there might be some discussion at UNCTAD VI of the very valuable suggestions which have already been made in the report of the Commonwealth Group of Experts, <i>The North/South Dialogue&#x2014;Making it Work,</i> and the noble Lord will be aware that that was published at the end of last year. The United Kingdom has very firm proposals which we should like the conference to consider when it meets.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00501"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not one of the most important subjects on the agenda of UNCTAD that concerning trade in commodities? Will the Minister call to the attention of the Minister for Trade the excellent report which was produced by a committee of this House under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Roberthall, which put forward a number of very practical proposals in this field? Will the noble Lord have that report taken off the shelves, where it no doubt is, dusted down, and given an airing at the Belgrade conference?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00502"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord and indeed your Lordships' House that none of the reports that are debated in your Lordships' House ever gathers dust anywhere&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00503"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Oh&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00504"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: Indeed, my Lords, they are very much valued. The noble Lord's own debate last week was very much valued, and my noble friend has in front of him all the comments that were made last week and in the earlier debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Roberthall.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00505"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that all the UNCTAD conferences for the past decade have been full of very good ideas when the conferences have been going on, but that very little has been implemented afterwards? Will the noble Lord be prepared to consider that after the forthcoming UNCTAD conference we have our own British conference to examine what really can be done to involve the Confederation of British Industry, people who are expert in commerce and industry, the trade unions, and everyone who in the end will have to make a real contribution? Would it not be a reasonable idea to consult them to see to what extent we can make a reality of some of the resolutions of UNCTAD?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00506"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has raised a very interesting, indeed a very important, suggestion, but I think that even he would agree that, with all its implications, it goes considerably wide of the Questions which are on the Order Paper today.</membercontribution></p>
<col>78</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00507"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord can give some indication of when the common fund for commodities is likely to be put into operation. It has been in preparation for a long time. Can he say what is now the position about global negotiations within the United Nations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00508"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that I cannot give the noble Lord an answer on the global negotiations, but perhaps I may find out what precisely is the position and let him know. So far as the common fund for commodities is concerned, I am sure that the noble Lord will be aware that the United Kingdom ratified the agreement as long ago as December 1981, but unfortunately the number of ratifications is still only half of the total required to put the agreement into force. We earnestly hope that the number of ratifications will rapidly reach the required level.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00509"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, within the context of the Minister's reply in which he said that the Government have specific proposals to put to UNCTAD VI, can he tell the House just what position the Government take towards the protectionism which has been condemned in both the Commonwealth document to which he referred and the Brandt Commission report? Can the noble Lord specifically address himself to the multifibre agreement, which is so resented in many third world countries? In connection with that, is he, unlike, it seems, the general public, aware that imports of textiles into this country are much greater&#x2014;about eight times greater&#x2014;from the developed countries than they are from the developing countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00510"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we shall note the noble Lord's last point with interest. I would stress to the noble Lord, and indeed to your Lordships, that the Government attach the greatest importance to maintaining the open multilateral trade system. In the view of the Government, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is the best instrument for achieving the aims which we all seek. Of course we recognise that UNCTAD has an important role to play, since both UNCTAD and the GATT are complementary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00511"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord answer my question? What is the Government's position on the protectionism that is condemned both in the Brandt Commission report and the Commonwealth report? Is it not a fact that the Government have boasted of increasing the amount of protection against imports to this country? What policy will they take through UNCTAD on this issue?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00512"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall, and can only, reiterate the first Answer that I gave to the noble Lord. We attach the greatest importance to a multilateral trade system since we believe that this is the best way to achieve what the noble Lord clearly wants and, above all, what the Government want.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00513"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord see any hope whatever of reducing the tragic levels of unemployment in all Western countries except by raising standards in the third world and therefore raising demand in the third world? Will the Government use all their influence to ensure that Western countries take this matter much more seriously?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0048"/>
<col>79</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00514"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we do take the question of our own economy, and indeed the economy of the entire world, very seriously. We shall note the noble Lord's comment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00515"><member>Lord Drumalbyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will consideration be given in this conference to distinguishing between the very poor countries and the newly industrialised countries where the problems are quite different?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00516"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am absulutely sure that this distinction will be drawn. We are grateful to my noble friend for drawing our attention to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00517"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord whether the Government at the UNCTAD meetings&#x2014;I ask this very sincerely&#x2014;will seek a partnership between the industrialised nations and the developing nations to end the deadlock of the last nine years; and whether they will appreciate that the developing countries represent two-thirds of the population of the world? Is it not the case that in the future the new world must reflect its partnership in our economic relations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00518"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we respect and note carefully what the noble Lord says. As he and, I am sure, your Lordships will agree, the purpose of UNCTAD and of our meetings is to reach international consensus. But we have been discussing our ideas with our partners in the Community and in the OECD.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Third World and the USSR</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00519">3.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00520"><member>Earl Cathcart</member> rose to call attention to the increasing Soviet penetration and influence in the third world; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00521">The noble Earl said: I believe that this Motion should be complementary to the excellent short debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Oram, last Wednesday on the Brandt Commission report <i>Common Crisis,</i> to which I listened throughout with great interest. It is not my intention to argue that the Soviet Union should not become involved in third world problems. The Soviet Union clearly has as much right as we in the West, or the free world, to assume that its way of life and experience can be of value to the developing nations if required. Nor do I intend to become involved in a comparison of the Marxist system with democracy, because we are all confident that our standards of justice and tolerance, our defence of the right of free speech and our respect for the rights of the individual, combined with our industrial and technical skills, give us so much that we can and should try to pass on to the third world.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00522">However, if there are some who feel inclined to draw attention to the shortcomings and weaknesses in our system, we do at least have the ability to identify those shortcomings. We have the privilege and freedom to discuss them. This quality alone is something worth trying to pass on.</p>
<col>80</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00523">I wish, in this debate, to indicate that the Soviet Union is extending its influence into the third world for the wrong reasons and in the wrong way. It would appear that Soviet policy in the third world is aimed at extending Marxist doctrine and establishing a series of Communist trading communities in the developing countries to the exclusion of Western trade in those countries. Soviet direct military action since 1945 has occurred only in countries adjacent to the USSR such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary and now Afghanistan. Elsewhere, she conducts her strategic policy by proxy, using countries with pro-Soviet Governments to destabilise neighbouring countries. This destabilising policy is directed against areas of strategic importance for Western trade and supply routes and ultimately for military strategic purposes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00524">Before we discuss individual areas of the third world, I think that we should identify more clearly what we mean by the third world. In Lord Oram's debate last Wednesday my noble friend Lord Thomas of Swynnerton quoted Sir Winston Churchill who described the third world as a sludgy amalgam. Certainly it is ill-defined, and perhaps wisely so, since its membership varies according to how its meaning is interpreted. For some it is a group of newly emerging nations which have recently gained their independence and, having not yet fully established their national identity, need help to develop their economic, judicial and technical skills, in order to administer their people and to develop their natural potential. For others, third world nations are those which have not aligned themselves to the system of one or other of the two super-powers&#x2014;sort of global "don't knows". Yet again, for others, a third world country is one that cannot survive without foreign aid. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Bauer and Professor Yamey of the London School of Economics wrote in <i>The Times</i> on Monday 11th April:
<quote>"Without foreign aid there is no third world".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00525">Whether or not you agree with these two professors, this definition extends potential membership of the third world way beyond the newly emerging nation category. The Soviet Union has made enormous efforts in the past 20 years to extend its influences through trade and financial aid throughout the third world. These efforts have been greatly supported by its vastly expanded merchant navy. The number of Soviet merchant ships has increased from 2,024 in 1966 to nearly 8,000 in 1981 with a total tonnage of 23&#x00BD; million tonnes, considerably larger than the United States merchant fleet and in size second only to the Japanese.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00526">This drive to gain influence through trade by the Soviet Union and the Soviet <i>bloc</i> has been especially marked in the continent of Africa that possesses 30 per cent. of the world's mineral reserves. No doubt, to defend this trade and to protect her sea routes, the Soviet Union has been able to establish nine naval base facilities&#x2014;I repeat "facilities"&#x2014;around the coast of Africa and on the adjacent islands in the Indian Ocean. These bases are at Luanda in Angola, Conakry in Guinea, Tripoli in Libya, on the Eritrean coast of the Red Sea. Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, on the Socotra Island of South Yemen, Maputo in Mozambique, Antseranana in Madagascar and Port Louis in Mauritius.</p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0049"/>
<col>81</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00527">In spite of the fact that the entire coastline of Africa is adjacent to one of the major sea-routes for the West including the oil tanker route round the Cape, Russia has established more naval based facilities there than any other nation. In the continent of Africa there are 40 main independent nations, counting in this number the three offshore islands in the Indian Ocean of Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles. The Institute for the Study of Conflict has calculated that in 25 of these 40 nations, there are about 55,000 Soviet and Soviet <i>bloc</i> commercial and economic technicians. Twelve of these 40 nations have pro-Soviet Governments. I believe that these figures alone, when combined with the successful establishment of nine naval base facilities, are an indication of the degree to which the Soviet Union has penetrated that continent.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00528">However, this intense Soviet economic thrust in Africa has not been entirely successful, partly due to the inflexibility of the Soviet approach and partly because of the inadequacy of the Soviets' own economic system and their inability to expand trade, but above all because the centrally planned economies of Russia and Eastern Europe cannot satisfy the developing needs of private enterprise. However, if Soviet overseas economic policies have not been over-successful, the Soviet Union has succeeded in greatly expanding the export sales of Soviet arms, which since 1974 have accounted for 50 per cent. of their total export sales. Soviet arms sales to Africa alone trebled between 1975 and 1977, and in my view this is an indication that their interests in the developing nations are for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00529">Soviet influence has been especially strong in Angola, Mozambique, Algeria and Libya, and more recently in Ethiopia, to which countries the Soviets have exported very large quantities of arms indeed. The technique of pursuing by proxy Soviet strategic aims is well known, and the Libyans, equipped and assisted by Russia, have been most active in this respect. Although we came to no conclusions today, I believe that the Question by the noble Lord, Lord Paget of Northampton, highlighted this fact.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00530">But most sinister of all has been the very considerable presence of Cuban troops on the Continent of Africa. Deployed in Angola, which is adjacent to mineral-rich Zambia and Zaire and to trouble-torn Namibia, Cuban troops with Soviet military advisers and arms are assisting the dissident factions in that country. Similarly, they are very active in Mozambique. They have at least one brigade of troops deployed in Ethiopia in support of that country's invasion of Somalia. Thus, Cuba has deployed strong forces of communist mercenaries in a continent nearly 4,000 miles from their Caribbean home. They are, in effect, the strongest proxy activists in the Soviet cause and are deployed on each occasion that I have quoted in the most anxious trouble spots on the African continent. Other noble Lords will, I know, be speaking in more detail about the Cuban deployment, so I will only add that it must be regarded as a mark of Soviet success and satisfaction that the third world elected President Fidel Castro to preside over their council.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00531">Before leaving Africa, there are two remaining areas which are strategically highly sensitive and where the
<col>82</col>
interests of Soviet policy are being satisfied by proxy. In August 1981 Libya, Ethiopia and South Yemen signed, with Soviet encouragement, the tripartite Pact of Aden. The Horn of Africa is adjacent to vital sea routes, especially for oil from the Gulf area. This pact effectively gives the Soviets a powerful strategic foothold in this important area, and, incidentally, also a naval base on Socotra. That these three dissimilar countries came together in a common pact is highly unusual: Ethiopia, a Christian country until the communist r&#x00E9;gime took over; allied with South Yemen, an Arab country which is not in Africa; joined by Libya, a North African Moslem country not adjacent to the pact area and, indeed, 1,500 miles away, with Sudan lying in between. The only thing in common among these three countries is that they all have pro-Soviet Governments.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00532">The pact provides a threat to the security of the Sudan, which has its own ethnic problems in its southern region ripe for destabilisation. It also provides a threat to the integrity of North Yemen; while Ethiopia has already begun a hostile invasion of Somalia, nominally to support the dissident Kulmis faction but in fact to consolidate the whole of the Horn area for the pact.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00533">A most valuable fact-finding mission was undertaken last year by Mr. Louis Fitzgibbon, a winner of the Airey Neave Memorial Scholarship, who went to Somalia to review the problems on the spot. I am also particularly glad that my noble friend Lord Ailsa is taking part in this debate because he has recently made several visits to the Horn of Africa, and we shall listen to what he has to tell us at first-hand with very great interest.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00534">Even while Mr. Fitzgibbon was visiting Somalia last year the Ethiopians invaded and, although badly outnumbered, the Somalis appear to have held their ground. Mr. Fitzgibbon was able to inspect captured Ethiopian tanks, vehicles and equipment, and saw Russian markings and instructions on these vehicles and on the equipment. He reports that intelligence indicated the presence of Soviet officers on the scale of two per battalion, with more senior Soviet officers at Ethiopian divisional headquarters, and that a considerable amount of the radio traffic was in Russian. These facts were later confirmed to him by an Ethiopian officer prisoner to whom he spoke.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00535">As I have already described, a Cuban brigade is deployed at Jigjiga, in the forward battle area, and Cuban air strikes against Somali troops have been identified by radio traffic in Spanish. Incidentally, as a mark of Soviet influence in this area, the Ethiopian badge of valour is the red star with the inscription "Ethiopian Crusader" underneath.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00536">The second pact which satisfies by proxy Soviet strategic aims in this part of the world is the tripartite Pact of Port Louis, signed in July last year between Madagascar, Mauritius and the Seychelles, all with pro-Soviet Governments. This pact, which has provided two important naval base installations for the Soviet navy&#x2014;one at the northern tip of Madagascar and one at Port Louis in Mauritius&#x2014;has the avowed aim of denying to the United States the use of their Indian Ocean base at Diego Garcia. Thus, if this pact succeeds in its aim it will leave the Soviets with a uniquely powerful naval capability astride the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0050"/>
<col>83</col>
West's most vital sea routes in the Indian Ocean. Mr. Leonid Brezhnev sent this pact a message of approval and described its area of influence as a "zone of peace". Alas&#x0021;, the word "peace" is a much abused word these days.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00537">Before I turn to Central America, I must make a brief reference to other parts of the world. Apart from Vietnam I do not think that the Soviets have made much impact in the Far East, mostly because of China's interest and influence there. No doubt the Soviets justify their invasion of Afghanistan as protecting their own security and stability because it is adjacent to their own frontiers. However, if the Soviets consolidate their strength there and even extend into Baluchistan, the strategic consequences for the whole of the Middle East and for the free world will be enormous.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00538">Finally, I turn to Central America, another highly sensitive area where Russia's friends in Cuba and Nicaragua are stirring rebellion and chaos which could result in the total destabilisation of this most sensitive area. Once again, this area includes the Panama Canal, a vital seaway between the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean and, once again, the acts of unrest are conducted by proxy but with Soviet arms and encouragement. This time the area is the more sensitive because of its nearness to the United States of America, which naturally sees the risk of a second Cuba being established on the mainland of America. President Reagan has described the area as the front garden of the United states. Apart from the anxious prospects of a second Cuba and the prospect of Soviet missile sites being set up so near to their frontiers, the United States must be anxious that the resulting chaos with countless refugees will erupt into Mexico, a country which is currently facing serious economic disturbance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00539">Counting Venezuela and Colombia, there are 10 mainland nations which go to make up Central America. You may think that Cuba in the Caribbean is not included, but nevertheless, as usual, it has thrown itself fully into that area by giving military support and arms to Nicaragua and to the dissident elements of neighbouring countries; and by all reports many tons of Soviet arms are pouring into Cuba, which are then passed on to Nicaragua.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00540">Leaving aside Venezuela, Columbia, Panama, Belize and Mexico (as so far they have not been affected), one is left with five nations in the centre of Central America. I should like to mention Belize. That nation (which has not been in any way touched by this disturbance) is, at the request of its people, guarded, by 1,400 British troops, and they must be thankful for that security.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00541">The five nations in the centre of Central America all received their independence in 1821, so that in no way can they be called newly emerging nations. All need foreign aid to survive, which is my final possible distinction as regards the third world. Whether or not they are non-aligned "don't knows", sadly I must say that that decision is likely to be taken with much bloodshed and chaos. On one side Cuba is sending arms and equipment of Soviet origin into Sandista's forces in Nicaragua, who in turn arm and train the dissidents in their neighbours' territory. If newspaper reports are accurate, one reads of Nicaraguan officers
<col>84</col>
being trained by Warsaw Pact countries. It must be said that, with one exception, none of these five threatened countries in Central America is currently ruled by r&#x00E9;gimes which have much to commend them to us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00542">The exception is Costa Rica which, under President Luis Monge, is emerging as a stable, well-administered state. But it has misguidedly unilaterally disbanded its army, leaving only a small civil guard almost certainly inadequate to withstand the tests of state security with which it is likely to be confronted in the near future. It is difficult to come to any other conclusion but that President Reagan is right to attempt, by all means short of direct intervention, to try and stabilise the threatening situation in his front garden, even though it means bolstering existing, but often unsatisfactory, regimes, especially in El Salvador.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00543">It is most noteworthy to record that this United States aid is conditioned in El Salvador upon properly US supervised democratic elections being organised as soon as possible. It is no coincidence that the three specific areas which I have emphasised&#x2014;the Horn of Africa, the Indian Ocean trade routes and Central America&#x2014;where pro-Soviet Governments are stirring unrest and instability, are all areas of supreme strategic importance for the maintenance of peaceful trade and co-existence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00544">In his recent speech to the Institute of Strategic Studies, my noble friend Lord Carrington stressed that we must face Russia with resolution and calmness. I hope that the opportunity with which this debate provides us of assessing and analysing Soviet actions, will help us to do exactly that. My Lords, I beg to call attention to the increasing Soviet penetration and influence in the third world, and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00545">3.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00546"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for giving us this opportunity to debate a subject of the utmost importance. He has also made a wide-ranging and interesting speech and, although I sympathise with many of the things he said, he will not be surprised to know that I do not share his entire analysis of the situation. The problems which the noble Earl has touched upon are so complex and their implications are so great that one approaches them with restraint and, indeed, with humility.<lb/>
This is not 1883, and Britain does not hold the position she held then. The <i>Pax Britannica</i> is gone. Britain's influence in world affairs is diminished, although there is still much that we can do; and the world is a more dangerous place because of the speed of communications and especially because of the nuclear arms build-up. I shall return to our own position and possible contribution later.<lb/>
In his Motion the noble Earl comprehends the two major post-war developments: first, the emergence of the two super powers; and, secondly, the indentification of a so-called third world following the dismantling of the European empires. There has developed a great historic power struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States, and this continues unabated at the present time. This struggle in all its aspects has been the main preoccupation of most countries over the last three decades. It has ebbed and flowed. We had the cold war and a period of <i>d&#x00E9;tente,</i>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0051"/>
<col>85</col>
and we are now in a third and as yet uncertain phase. The clear objectives of Soviet policy are to hold the borders of the Communist <i>bloc</i>&#x2014;Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland are proof of that; secondly, to make advances where they think they can succeed without risk of total war&#x2014;Afghanistan is testimony to that; and, lastly, to achieve new spheres of influence, as the noble Earl has sought to describe in his speech.<lb/>
Because of its very nature, the Soviet Union is able to pursue a single-minded policy, and that policy is both ideological and expansionist. It may be&#x2014;and it is to be hoped it is&#x2014;the case that the Russian people are becoming more concerned with their living standards and less with ideology than they have been in the past. The Soviet policy has also, on the whole, been realistic. If it ceased to be so the danger of war would be much more acute.<lb/>
The West, led far more loosely by the United States, is not a cemented structure. We argue and we wrangle, and from time to time we disagree. But it would be a grave mistake for the Soviet Union to suspect that we are not in agreement on our fundamental need for defence against aggression from any quarter. We are committed to the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty, as I stressed in the debate on 16th February.<lb/>
I cannot agree with the noble Earl that Soviet policies&#x2014;in terms of real penetration, in terms of establishing firm power bases&#x2014;have been the great success that some appear to believe. They have made some advances, as in Cuba and Ethiopia, but they have also failed, as in Egypt and Somalia. It has certainly cost them much more than they can afford in money and resources. This is something that the Russian people will also be considering.<lb/>
What is the general attitude of the third world, as defined so carefully by the noble Earl, to this great struggle, to the Soviets and to us in the West? Most third world countries were colonies, mandates or dependencies of one kind or another of European countries and the one thing they do not want is to become colonies again. Indeed, one of the most consistent features of the post-colonial third world is its profound reluctance to be involved in the conflict between East and West. Those countries which have accepted military aid from the West have done so to strengthen themselves against their neighbours and not against the Soviet Union. Pakistan against India is one example.<lb/>
One of the tragedies is the amount of money&#x2014;money which they certainly can illafford&#x2014;which third world countries spend on armaments. We should note that in the 1970s the share of world armaments taken by the third world doubled from 6 per cent. to 12 per cent. But the fact is that the Soviets and the West run exactly the same risks when they seek to intervene in the third world.<lb/>
If the Soviet Union has one advantage it is one which the noble Earl stressed; namely, that they have been able to use Cuban troops as surrogates. And to the extent that the Cubans are black and themselves third world they may seem closer to the people whom the Soviets seek to control. But foreign troops are not popular and the people of Angola would be glad to see
<col>86</col>
the backs of Cuban troops. That is certainly the impression I received when I was there some three years ago.<lb/>
But that is a small consideration compared with the known fact that the people of Africa and their leaders, including those who have assumed the mantle of Marxism, do not desire to be interfered with or dominated by the Soviet Union. The main danger to the stability of Southern Africa is not the Cuban troops in Angola but the policies of South Africa in the region. As the House knows, regular armed attacks from South Africa upon Angola and Mozambique and other neighbouring countries including Lesotho, a defenceless Commonwealth country, are a serious, destabilising factor, as is the failure to reach a settlement in Namibia due to South African intransigence. No doubt the Soviet Union watches these events with great interest; but it is not their influence which is predominant there, it is the influence of South Africa. If we are to see a stable and prosperous Southern Africa it is that influence which must be diminished.<lb/>
These new states in Africa have great economic, social and political problems, and most of them have leaders who deserve respect. Leaders whose concern is peaceful development; men, like President Kaunda, President Nyerere, and Arap Moi, and others. But if South African policies eventually lead to their replacement there is then no guarantee that Soviet influence will not grow and spread. A settlement in Namibia and the end of South African adventures along the frontiers will help to pacify the area, but apartheid, while it exists, will always remain a basic menace in Southern Africa.<lb/>
The noble Earl has referred to other parts of the world including the Indian Ocean. I would not disagree with him save to say that I probably think that the huge expenditure by the Soviet Union on its navy there has hardly been justified. In the Middle East, the United States, since Camp David, has worked hard to find a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. They deserve all support for their efforts in what often seems a thankless task.<lb/>
The divisions and strains in the area go beyond the immediate conflict between the Arab countries and Israel. The Moslem world is in ferment, and here the Soviet Union has a natural, legitimate interest because it affects her own borders. In any final settlement it would appear reasonable that the Soviet Union's acquiescence should be a necessary ingredient.<lb/>
But as the noble Earl made plain, the Caribbean and Central America are regions where affairs are moving rapidly. The United States' interest is obvious, as she is entitled to be acutely concerned about what happens there.<lb/>
Last week President Reagan in his speech to Congress said that events were,
<quote>"a threat to the security and freedoms of the United States".</quote>
It is possible to sympathise with the President without seeing things in exactly the same light as he does. The world is not black and white, good or bad, left or right, as he explains it. It is a mix of them all. Is not the position that for several decades the people of Central America and indeed most of the Latin American countries have suffered from ill treatment, oppression,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0052"/>
<col>87</col>
and tyranny at the hands of a succession of corrupt right wing oligarchies; that these people have had enough of it, and that they are turning to whoever appears to offer them salvation?<lb/>
It so happens that the revolutionary movements are left-wing and supported by Cuba and the longer arm of the Soviet Union. But we have been sickened, all of us in this House, by what we have seen on our television screens. We have seen the appalling atrocities committed in El Salvador and in Guatemala. Over 35,000 people have been killed in El Salvador, and many of them were tortured and mutilated before being shot or hacked to death by the death squads of the Governments of those countries. Two thousand people have disappeared after being taken into custody by security forces. No one has been brought before the courts to answer for these atrocities.<lb/>
The Archbishop himself was shot in his cathedral, and those who went to a service in his honour were mown down by death squads. What should we do if we in this country were subjected to these horrors? Should we not stand up? Should we not rise against them? Of course we should. The distinguished journalist, Mr. Anthony Lewis, in <i>The Times</i> yesterday summed the position up well. He said:
<quote>"Those of us who live safely under authority restrained by law must find it hard to imagine life in such conditions. At the barest minimum people want some expectation of security&#x2014;of life&#x2014;from their government. How can a regime whose armed forces kill 100 of its citizens week after week expect attachment to its cause? How can it win a war, whatever aid it gets?"</quote>
No one could deny the Soviet interest in the area, or indeed deny that Cuba has played a sinister role in Latin American affairs from time to time, but the social uprising that we have seen, and the unrest which is sweeping Central America, are simply not the product of a Communist conspiracy. If, however, the situation there continues to polarise, then the influence of Cuba and the Soviet Union is bound to increase. That is the real danger.<lb/>
Three weeks ago, the so-called Condadora Group was formed. This comprises Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. They are concerned about the escalation of military action and the trends of United States policy, and they argue (and they are not left-wing regimes) that the better course is to encourage the formation of coalitions of Government and rebel forces to the exclusion of extremes of right and left. I see this as a most encouraging development, and I am sure that the House would be glad to have the reaction of Her Majesty's Government from the noble Lord when he replies.<lb/>
I would say to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, and I think he would agree, that military intervention either direct or indirect is the worst possible way of combating Soviet intervention. This is the lesson of recent history. It is dangerous because it threatens the escalation of the conflict into a new Vietnam; it arouses against the United States and the West the hostility of the whole population, the people who have suffered and who have sustained grevious losses; and finally it drives the United States, it drives the West, it drives us as allies of the United States, into deeper and deeper commitments in support of useless, reactionary and often cruel regimes with which the West has
<col>88</col>
nothing whatsoever in common. That is what has happened far too often in recent history.<lb/>
President Reagan has appointed Mr. Richard Stone as his special ambassador for Central America, and we must wish him well and hope that he is instructed to work for peaceful solutions and not military solutions; to take a long, hard, objective look at the realities of the situation; and to look at the appalling condition which the ordinary people of Central America are enduring&#x2014;people who want nothing more than the opportunity to live their lives and raise their children in peace. They are being forced, because of these diabolical ideological arguments that they do not understand, into indescribable suffering. I believe that Her Majesty's Government have a great deal of influence over the United States Administration. I think that this House will expect the Prime Minister and her colleagues to bring pressure to bear on the President and Mr. Shultz and their colleagues to seek new solutions before things worsen further.<lb/>
In considering this huge and complex scene, we may be in danger of too much emphasis upon the Soviet Union and too little emphasis on the third world itself. The essential problem is not about Soviet intervention, it is about preventing third world conflicts from escalating into super-power confrontations; and these conflicts are rooted in the third world itself and not in the relations between East and West. We have had our debates in this House on disarmament and on aid to the underdeveloped countries. As the noble Earl pointed out, we had an excellent debate on the second Brandt Report last week. I believe these are fundamental to the problems inherent in the noble Earl's Motion.<lb/>
The aims of Western statemanship should be, first, to help to resolve the sources of conflict in the third world, the chief of which is economic deprivation, and secondly, to begin again to establish clear working relations with the Soviet Union based on a mutual perception of interests. The weakness of Western policies at present is that they lack co-ordination. There are times, too, when we seem to be the most uncritical of all the allies of the United States. The true value of an ally and friend is that he is there to criticise when that is essential. We do not appear to be doing so as often as we should.<lb/>
There are many other matters relevant to the Motion and I feel that my remarks are inadequate to the challenge that the noble Earl has posed to the House. But there are several other matters, even if there is no time to enlarge upon them. I believe that the following are of great value and I merely list them in passing: the BBC's overseas broadcasting service; the activities of the British Council overseas; the admission of overseas students to British universities; the efficiency of our embassies abroad, notably our trade and agriculture attaches. A country which sends doctors and nurses, agriculturalists and engineers to poor countries does not need spies there&#x0021; At the end of the day, the struggle is one for the hearts and minds of people everywhere.<lb/>
For all the defects of our system, we can still claim that the principles which underly it are the freedom of the individual, liberty under the law and the establishment of free institutions. Moscow does not offer those. These are the weapons which will prevail in this
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0053"/>
<col>89</col>
struggle. They are the rights which the third world deserves and must have. I believe we should strive hard to that end.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00547">3.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00548"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we must all think that the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, has done well to draw the attention of the House to what no one denies is an important and potentially sinister development over the last few years. I agreed with a great deal of what he said in that respect, though I think he rather underestimated the fact that the Soviet Union has also lost very much of its ideological appeal to the nations of the world. But I also agreed with a great deal of what the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, has said. I am, in a way, perhaps between the two noble Lords.<lb/>
There is no doubt at all that the Soviet penetration and influence in various countries, mostly, though not entirely, in the poorer or what are called "underdeveloped" countries, has increased during the last decade to a substantial extent. Personally, I rather object to the phrase "third world" because I do not know what it means. Nobody knows what it means. It is a tendentious term and I believe it should be abandoned. There are such things as poorer and underdeveloped countries but it is not only in those countries that the Soviet Union has been extending its influence in recent years.<lb/>
Besides, as the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, pointed out, the Soviet Union has had substantial reverses, chief of which was the great break with China some 20 years ago, which from the Soviet point of view was a catastrophe. As Lord Cledwyn also said, there have been other substantial reverses, chief among them being Egypt and, undoubtedly, Somalia. Against this, however, the Soviet hold on Vietnam, Northern Korea, Ethiopia and the southern Yemen has undoubtedly been strengthened. Angola and Mozambique have been added to the Soviet sphere of influence, and the vast extension of the Soviet fishing fleet, which I believe consists of some 4,000 vessels&#x2014;I think the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, said 8,000, but I shall not quarrel about that because it is very large anyhow&#x2014;shepherded by a powerful high seas navy, has spread Soviet influence generally all round Africa, in the Indian Ocean and even, I believe, in the South Pacific. Above all, Cuba has remained what might be called the chief outpost and base, as it were, of Soviet power beyond the frontiers of its land empire, though, admittedly, at very great cost. I have seen it in the papers and I believe it is true that the latest estimate is that its effective subsidy to Cuba is no less than four billion dollars a year. And, has been pointed out already, Cuba has a substantial military role in Africa as well.<lb/>
Apart from Cuba, and the influence it exerts in Central America and the Caribbean, to which I shall come in a moment, the Soviet Union seems to have been mainly successful, from the power point of view, in consolidating its power in the Middle East, chiefly by means of a plentiful supply of arms to Libya, Syria and Iraq; by reason of its military stranglehold on Ethiopia, Southern Yemen and Aden; its virtual control of the vital Bab El Mandeb straits; its occupation of Afghanistan and the development of an
<col>90</col>
important air base within 600 miles of the Persian Gulf.<lb/>
All this, together with good relations with India, which is a substantial trading partner, has seemingly created a pretty firm basis in the whole area for successful operations in the event of hostilities with the West. That is a fact which, whatever our general views on the subject, we must acknowledge. The situation could worsen if Iran should ever incline northwards after the departure of the Ayatollah Khomeini: no one knows what may happen in Iran. If, however, by any evil chance there were ever another r&#x00E9;gime in Saudi Arabia involving a change of allegiance, or for that matter in Iran, it is indeed difficult to see how the West could successfully restore the situation, even by physical means. The vital supply of oil from the Gulf would obviously be in immediate and gravest danger. We are happily not near that point at present, and let us hope we never shall be, but it would be foolish not to recognise that the whole situation might change quite quickly to our general disadvantage. We must recognise that.<lb/>
The other rather critical area for the West is clearly Central America and the Caribbean. However much we may sympathise with the revolutionary Government of Nicaragua because of our detestation of the dreadful dictatorship of Somosa and with the rebels of El Salvador, who seem to be simply impoverished peasants protesting very courageously against a rather similar regime, we must recognise that, if these countries become communist countries on the Cuban model, the United States could be faced, whether we like it or not, with a dreadful dilemma. For, if the process of communisation were successfully accomplished in that whole area, that infection might well spread right up into Mexico and there would be visions of millions of refugees streaming northwards across the little-guarded Rio Grande. A breakdown of the international banking system resulting from a repudiation of enormous loans might quite conceivably result in some such desperate situation arising. This is not just a nightmare. The question is: what is the best way of avoiding such unpleasant developments, whether in the Caribbean or in that other rather vital area, the Middle East? The answer is not easy, but I will try to suggest a few guiding principles.<lb/>
In the first place&#x2014;and here I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn&#x2014;I am sure it would not be wise for the West (by which I mean substantially the United States, in co-operation and, if possible, in accord with the EEC) to contemplate a solution in either theatre primarily <i>vi et armis</i>&#x2014;that is, by physical force. The great object in the Middle East must surely be to maintain the pro-Western Governments of Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait so as to prevent the Soviet Union from extending its power and influence over the entire area, if possible. Certainly it would mean responding to any requests for arms that these governments may make, but, I believe that it would not necessarily imply building up a large potential intervention force with bases in, presumably, the Sudan or Somalia&#x2014;still less in Israel. Any suggestion like that, I think, might even be counterproductive; it might have the opposite effect to that intended. It might be advisable even to go rather
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0054"/>
<col>91</col>
slower with the development of Diego Garcia provided always that there was some assurance on the other side not to proceed with constructing some enormous base in Port Louis, Mauritius.<lb/>
As I have suggested, I imagine that our chances of redressing the balance in war if our allies succumbed&#x2014;whatever forces we might mobilise in the rather distant outskirts of this area&#x2014;might be rather dim. So it follows that the only real hope of maintaining a stable Western front in the Middle East is to arrive at some acceptable settlement of the future of the Arabs on the West Bank of Jordan. This thought should constantly&#x2014;and consistently, I think&#x2014;be represented to our American friends and allies, however unpopular it may be in New York or Washington or wherever. That is the essential point. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, is going to speak after me. He has just suggested in the press (unless I read him wrongly) that the situation has now become so desperate that perhaps the best thing in the long run would be for both the super-powers to get together in their own joint interest in order to arrive at some sort of solution. It is for the noble Lord to express his point of view but here I feel that he is right.<lb/>
In Middle East affairs, we Europeans, although we have little means of imposing our views, by reason of our experience, expertise and knowledge of the area, to say nothing of our acute interest, still have a certain role to play. It is rather different in central America which must present, on the face of it, problems which can only, in practice, be solved by the United States. It is true that both Britain and France have a direct interest in the neighbouring Caribbean. Several of the islands are members of the Commonwealth and two are actually <i>D&#x00E9;Partements</i> of France; but America is still the state with the most at stake in what happens there. Again, Europe can only give advice. What advice should we give?<lb/>
It is easy for us in the circumstances to say that the path of wisdom lies in letting Nicaragua develop as she pleases, no attempt being made to subvert any left-wing Government in that country however much it may be suspected of importing Soviet arms from Cuba or, indeed, via Libya. It is easy to say that. It is even easier to urge the Americans&#x2014;along, I may say, with many members of Congress&#x2014;not to get bogged down in any equivalent of another Vietnam war by actually engaging in the suppression of the rebellious peasants of El Salvador. All this is true. But we should also recognise the essential American dilemma. How would we like it if Ulster became a Soviet satellite?<lb/>
Maybe some new approach is required. I think it is. From this distance it is difficult to say exactly what it should be, but I believe (as, again, I think Lord Cledwyn pointed out) that the so-called Condadora front of four important Latin-American states are now working busily on a solution; and we can only hope that Her Majesty's Government, somehow or another, will back it up. I shall be very interested to hear (as I think Lord Cledwyn suggested) what the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, would say in that respect when he comes to wind up.<lb/>
Generally speaking, however, one thing is certain: the best way to counter any further extension of Soviet influence in what used to be called the third world, or
<col>92</col>
anywhere in the world, is to put an end to the present world recession with its accompanying catastrophic fall in the price of most of the exports of the countries concerned. That must be obvious. It is perhaps astonishing in the circumstances&#x2014;the price of sugar having fallen, for instance, to what it is&#x2014;that more countries have not joined the Soviet <i>bloc.</i> True, the invasion of Afghanistan severely lowered the stock of the Soviet Union among the so-called "non-aligned" countries in which, as I think somebody said, Cuba grotesquely figures. It is also a fact that the Kremlin simply does not have the economic means to subsidise more than a certain number of clients to whom, in any case, it exports about twice as much in arms and military supplies as it does in non-military goods. But the suffering imposed by the great recession in the "free" or non-totalitarian world is immense&#x2014;if, indeed, it is not rather absurd to talk about a "free" world in such distressing circumstances.<lb/>
What is really depressing, surely, is the apparently inevitable and increasing clash between the two superpowers all over the world. The advance of the one in any sphere&#x2014;economic, military, cultural&#x2014;can only, so it would seem, be at the expense of the other. I do not say this in an attempt to equate the two systems. We must believe that ours is basically superior to theirs&#x2014;of course, we do&#x2014;at least morally, even if some non-totalitarian countries are a disgrace to it in every sense of the word. But if we have reached the point at which some kind of settlement in the arms race is the only alternative to World War III&#x2014;and perhaps we have&#x2014;then such a settlement must be arrived at in the realm of politics and economics as well. In other words, the super-powers, without abandoning their respective principles, should somehow get together and, as it were, give each other the necessary signals behind the scenes. It has happened before. It happened towards the end of the Korean war when I think Iakob Alessandrovitch Malik met Mr. Jessup in a lavatory in the United Nations&#x0021;<lb/>
But, before that sort of thing happens, Mr. Andropov would have to acknowledge implicitly, if not explicitly, that the so-called Brezhnev doctrine of potential support for non-elected Communist insurgents anywhere in the world no longer applies. In return America might do well to make it clear that, although she continues to believe in the ultimate triumph of human rights, she has no intention of physically intervening in order to disrupt the Soviet empire. In any case, what we must all hope is that, together with our European associates, we shall be able somehow to advance solutions designed to moderate the Cold War, if not to end it.<lb/>
This does not mean that we should do anything to weaken the alliance on the maintenance of which our whole future depends. But it does mean that the EEC, on the political side, should be a powerful and reasonable middle element in international politics. After all, by reason of its very geographical position it should be that. I noted (and I think Lord Cledwyn also mentioned this) the wise remarks made the other day by Lord Carrington in another place. I only hope, as we all wish, that the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, would come here even more than he does at present and give us the benefit of his wise advice. Generally

I should like to concentrate on a single area which he has mentioned: that is, the area of Central America. It seems to me that a good deal of the information and many of the perceptions about this area are somewhat suspect for a number of reasons. For example, we have had on the television recently, and especially on the BBC, a series of programmes which have been deplorably one-sided on the subject of events in Central America. They culminated in a film quite recently&#x2014;I think it was last week&#x2014;which seemed to me to be even more disgraceful than those which preceded it. A more recent manifestation has been a remarkably strident and unbalaced article in <i>The Times</i> by an American journalist who has been known for some time to be one of President Reagan's most persistent and hostile critics.<lb/>
I think that what this does is to produce in this country a somewhat distorted perception of what is going on in that area.

It seemed to me to reflect the view that for the ills of the world there are many things to be blamed&#x2014;apartheid, Islam, Right-wing oligarchies and brutal militaristic dictators&#x2014;but never the Soviet Union.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00552"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do draw that inference from the noble Lord's speech. He seemed to point out, for example, that in the Middle East it was resurgent Islam that was causing the instability, and that in other areas, such as Southern Africa, the great enemy was South Africa and apartheid, and not the Soviet Union. In Central America he pointed to the Right-wing oligarchies and their records of brutality over many years. I am simply pointing out that there is also the Soviet Union, which seems to me to be a much greater threat to our future than any of those.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00554"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that perhaps some facts are sometimes a valuable corrective to the more extreme kinds of fantasy and opinion. I should like to look at this area of Central America for a moment, and to produce, if I may, in the short time at my disposal, a few facts without very many opinions. If noble Lords can look in their mind's eye at that very important area which starts with the northern frontiers of Mexico, which has a common frontage with four of the southern States of the United States of America, which then goes down an ever-narrowing piece of land towards Guatemala and Honduras through El
<col>94</col>
Salvador and Nicaragua, through the very narrow isthmus of Costa Rica and Panama, and then down to the great and important sub-continent of South America, just very slightly to the east of all that&#x2014;in fact, 125 miles away at nearest point from Mexico&#x2014;is Cuba, about the same distance from the coast of Mexico as London is from Bristol. If we could keep that geographical area in our minds for the moment, I think we must look at it as something which is becoming one of the most crucial strategic areas in the world and which, in my view, provides links in a chain of Russian projection of power and influence which could, and might very soon, radically upset the world balance of power; and to pretend that this projection of influnce does not exist and is not increasing seems to me to be foolish and irresponsible.<lb/>
The chain begins with Cuba. It is one of five countries selected by the Soviet strategic plan to provide bases for global influence, the application of foreign and military policies and, as the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, pointed out, the setting up of Soviet-dominated economic cells around the world. The other four areas are Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Afghanistan, which of course is now occupied by Soviet armed forces. I do not want to concern myself with those today, but to come back to Cuba.<lb/>
Cuba receives from the Soviet Union, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, has said, the equivalent of over &#x00A3;7 million worth of aid per day. That is nearly &#x00A3;1 a day per head of the population. It has been receiving free military aid for many years from the Soviet Union&#x2014;in the past, at the rate of about &#x00A3;200 million a year. But what is important is that there has been a recent and very significant increase in this level of military aid. In 1981 the Soviet Union delivered 63,000 tonnes of arms to Cuba, the highest total it has delivered there since 1962, which was the year of the Cuban missile crisis. In 1982 it became even better (or worse, depending on how you look at it) because they delivered 68,000 tonnes of arms; and this, together with other forms of equipment and assistance, represents over &#x00A3;500 million worth of military assistance in a year to Cuba. In addition, during 1982, last year, Soviet military advisers in Cuba increased in number by 20 per cent. There are now 2,500 military advisers there, and that is in addition to 6,000 Russian civilian advisers and a combat brigade of Soviet troops.<lb/>
In 1982, certainly one and possibly two squadrons of MiG 23s were sent to Cuba. The MiG 23 is not a child's toy; it is an advanced supersonic fighter aircraft which is capable of carrying bombs, missiles and nuclear weapons. Cuba is now the largest military power in the area. Furthermore, like its master, the Soviet Union, it is achieving the ability to project its military power outside its own frontiers.<lb/>
Now let us go to the next link from Cuba. Let us go east and south in that big arc of islands known as the Lesser Antilles down to the island of Grenada, which, although it is at the end of that chain of islands which comes down from Cuba, is, I would remind your Lordships, only 100 miles from the coast of Venezuela. On the island of Grenada the Cubans and the Soviets are at work increasing their influence, seeking to reinforce the power of the Bishop r&#x00E9;gime in Grenada, and to create a firm base there for future
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0056"/>
<col>95</col>
Soviet and Cuban activities. There is a powerful Cuban radio transmitter now installed on the island, and the Soviet Union is assisting the Cubans in the construction of a large and extremely comprehensive military airfield by extending the runway and the other airport and airfield facilities at Point Salines. The Cubans are building a large military camp on the island, and, all in all, without going any further into the details, Grenada is gradually becoming a closed totalitarian society, increasingly under the influence of the Soviet Union and Cuba.<lb/>
Let us go south and east again, this time down to South America itself, to Surinam. This used to be Dutch Guiana, the territory between British and French Guiana. There is a long common border with Brazil, one of the most important countries of Latin America. It is also on the verge of becoming a totalitarian dictatorship linked to Cuba. The Cuban ambassador recently appointed to Surinam is Oswaldo Cardenas, a very highly-placed Cuban intelligence officer, who was very largely instrumental in helping to establish the Bishop Government in Grenada. He has now been moved to Surinam to carry on his business in South America.<lb/>
Let us now go back north and west, again into Central America, to Nicaragua, to which a certain amount of reference has been made today. With Soviet advisers and troops in Cuba to take care of matters there, the Cubans, of course, can begin to move outside their own frontiers. And where are they going? They are going first to Nicaragua. There are 2,000 Cuban military advisers now in Nicaragua, in addition to the Soviet and East German advisers who have been there for some time.<lb/>
Nicaragua is building the largest military establishment in Central America: 36 new military bases are currently under construction in Nicaragua. And it is not only Cuban aid which is going to this country. Someone earlier in this debate mentioned press reports of help from East European countries. These are not just press reports. At this moment there are 17 Nicaraguan military pilots being trained in Bulgaria; and there are 50 Soviet tanks in Nicaragua, together with hundreds of anti-aircraft guns, three brigades of Soviet artillery and a very considerable force of assault helicopters.<lb/>
Quite apart from the military aid that goes quite openly from the Soviet Union to Nicaragua, let us also bear in mind those three aircraft that were stopped in Brazil a short while ago carrying what were called "medical supplies" to Nicaragua, which turned out to be combat military equipment. Those came from Libya, which is one of the largest Middle Eastern importers of Soviet arms. I do not think it needs a genius to know the origin of the arms that were travelling as "medical supplies" from Libya to Nicaragua. And may I say that, if the airfield in Grenada which is at present under construction had been completed, there would have been no need for those aircraft to stop in Brazil. They would have landed in Grenada and no one would have known what was going on at all.<lb/>
Let me almost complete the circle and come northwest to the little country of El Salvador. There is
<col>96</col>
already a very substantial clandestine infiltration of arms and equipment from Nicaragua into El Salvador. This is fully and irrefutably documented. I was interested, to say the very least, to hear that both the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, seemed to be content to characterise the uprising in El Salvador as that of impoverished peasants and freedom fighters.<lb/>
It might be interesting to note that there have been four major guerrilla groups in action in El Salvador since the 1970s. It might also be interesting to note that since 1979 their activities have been systematically coordinated by the Communist Party of El Salvador. It might also be interesting to note that they have now formed themselves into a group, or consortium, of communist organisations, known as the DRU, and the DRU gets its support, openly and avowedly, from President Castro. If we really believe that these are simply idealistic, impoverished peasants, can we ask ourselves why it was that in the summer of 1980 the leader of the Communist Party of El Salvador visited the Soviet Union, the German People's Republic&#x2014;the GDR&#x2014;Bulgaria and Hungary, in search of support for the revolutionary movement, and received promises of that support? At the same time, the DRU sent representatives to Nicaragua and received promises of help in their uprising there. This does not seem to me to be the world of the idealistic, impoverished, apolitical freedom fighter. I think there is something much more sinister about it than that.<lb/>
Finally, let us briefly look north to Mexico and, through Mexico, to that border with the southern states of the United States of America. Can we, when we consider what is taking place in terms of the projection of Soviet power and of their surrogate, Cuba, in that area, have any doubt that this is now, for better or for worse, for one reason or another, an area of vital strategic interest? It is no longer an area in which oppressed people are simply searching for their freedom. It has become much more than that.<lb/>
Someone suggested earlier, and it has been suggested often in public, that the actions of the United States of America are, in some way, dragging the Soviet Union and Cuba into this area and creating a super-power confrontation. The American presence in the area consists of 54 military advisers in El Salvador. The Soviet military advisers in Cuba alone outnumber the whole of the United States military adviser corps in all Latin America. The supplies of Soviet arms to Cuba alone outweigh all the American supplies of arms to the whole of Latin America by 10 to 1. We do not need to drag the communists&#x2014;the Russians and the Cubans&#x2014;into Central America; they are there. It seems to me strange that, simply because the President of the United States now chooses to try to prevent something happening there which might have an appalling effect on the security of his own country, and of the rest of the Western Alliance, he should be pilloried and vilified in this way.<lb/>
What is happening in Central America&#x2014;and in South America, for that matter&#x2014;is much more important to us here in the United Kingdom and the West than I think we realise. The River Elbe is 4,000 miles from Washington. El Salvador is 2,000 miles from Washington. The southern states of the United
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0057"/>
<col>97</col>
States of America&#x2014;Arizona, Texas and New Mexico&#x2014;are 1,500 miles from El Salvador. I mention these somewhat childish statistics simply to point out that Central America is significantly closer to the United States of America than Western Europe, and there is a possibility&#x2014;a very real possibility&#x2014;that, if the situation in Central America deteriorates, the United States might turn away from Western Europe in order to concentrate its security arrangements to meet the very real threat from Central America. It is a real problem and it affects us all.<lb/>
We must not, it seems to me, be distracted or brainwashed by simplistic rhetoric about bolstering up brutal dictatorships. Of course, the pursuit and protection of human rights remains a primary aim of any Western democracy. One of the cardinal objectives of United States policy&#x2014;and ours&#x2014;in the area must be to maintain those rights. But the alternatives to the dictators of today, however evil they may be, are the dictators of communist totalitarianism. That is the alternative. And if they come to power it is not only the Salvadoreans who will lose their freedom as the Grenadans, the Surinamese and the Nicaraguans are now losing theirs&#x2014;and as the Cubans have already done&#x2014;it is all of us who will suffer. In the last analysis, the security of the United States could be put at risk and that means the security of the whole of the Western Alliance.<lb/>
So the next time the BBC shows one of its propaganda films from Central America, or the next time one of our quality newspapers prints an article by a disaffected American journalist, it might be as well to remember that, just as the River Elbe has been the frontier of American security for nearly 40 years, today the Cape sea routes, the Persian Gulf and the Panama Canal are ours.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00556"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we owe a debt of gratitude to my noble friend Lord Cathcart for the masterly way in which he started this debate, and for the very statesmanlike words with which he introduced it. We always enjoy his speeches, but I thought that today's effort was one of the very best that I have heard. We also owe a debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, who always puts his finger on the spot and brings back a sense of proportion. I agree wholeheartedly with him.<lb/>
I watched the "Panorama" programme of Monday, 25th April, and I thought that, even by the "Panorama" team's standard, it was more extreme and more unbalanced than any of its predecessors. Somehow it managed to condemn the USA for everything that was happening in Central America and virtually nothing was said about Cuba or Russia. That was a current affairs programme and yet there was no mention of the three or four aircraft which had been grounded in Brazil, carrying Russian arms via Libya to Nicaragua. They were not mentioned at all. The programme was so anxious to condemn America and their President that they forgot all the other relevant facts in what was meant to be a balanced programme.<lb/>
I would only say this of the BBC's "Panorama" team. If they are totally unable to produce the balance which the charter of the BBC dictates that they should, there is only one inevitable consequence, and that is
<col>98</col>
that, as with the IBA, an authority will be set up to try to ensure that a balance is kept. At the moment, the BBC are judge and jury in their own case, and it does not seem to be working out in that field, any more than it does in any other field where people seek to judge themselves and do not leave it to an independent arbiter.<lb/>
I want to concentrate on the dangers to the free world of Soviet activities in Africa, south of the Sahara. I hope to listen to my noble friend Lord Ailsa, who has recently returned from that other vitally important part of Africa&#x2014;the Horn of Africa. He goes there often and has come back with a lot of up-to-date evidence, which we shall look forward to hearing.<lb/>
As Moscow's military and naval strength has increased, so has its boldness, brazenness and blatant intervention&#x2014;sometimes direct, as in Afghanistan. It would not have dared invade Afghanistan 20 years ago. More generally, though, Moscow's intervention is indirect&#x2014;as in Central America, as in South-East Asia, as in Africa. Disruption of the fragile stability in Africa is all to easy. Disruption is caused not only because it is easy but because Africa is the source of many of the raw materials upon which the free world is utterly dependent for its economic viability. Furthermore, South Africa is the vulnerable route for the oil supplies of the free world.<lb/>
The United States of America is 75 per cent. dependent on foreign imports of bauxite, manganese, nickel, cobalt and chrome. Since I have mentioned chrome many noble Lords may think of chromium-plated cars, but chrome is an essential part of every jet engine. There are 1&#x00BD; tonnes of chrome in every jet engine, and chrome is essential in the manufacture of ball-bearings, precision instruments and missiles. The fact is that 92 per cent. of United States chrome is imported and that 96 per cent. of the world's reserves of chrome are to be found in South Africa and in Zimbabwe. This illustrates how vulnerable the free world is if those areas continue to swing towards the communist philosophy. Cobalt, another vital material, is also mined largely in South Africa.<lb/>
We have to remind ourselves&#x2014;other speakers have done so&#x2014;that if Europe and North America neglect their dependence upon oil coming round the Cape they will do so at their peril. Indeed, the oil supplies of 90 per cent. of the NATO nations of Europe are brought to them round the Cape. Therefore, the whole of that military machine could very quickly be brought to a standstill. Furthermore, 70 per cent. of West European strategic materials pass within a few miles of Cape Town. I mention these figures because there seems to be only one thing which the world can agree about, and that is being bloody-minded to South Africa.<lb/>
I wholly disapprove of apartheid. I believe that we should use all the pressures we can command to persuade South Africa. I believe that South Africa is being persuaded, certainly in the sporting field. The fact is that 97 British cricketers went to South Africa; many of them coached coloured, black and mixed cricket teams during their recent summer, our winter. I met some of them. Already they are making a great deal of progress. Noble Lords may think that sport is of indirect benefit, but it creates an attitude of mind. Because of the broadcasts people are now keen to join
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0058"/>
<col>99</col>
cricket clubs, whether Indian, coloured, African or mixed clubs. This is very heartening. It is the result of the pressures which have been brought to bear on South Africa, and I hope that pressure will continue to be applied.<lb/>
The sinister part of this, if it be sinister, is that although we all condemn racism in South Africa we never seem to condemn racism when it occurs in other countries. The Jewish people in the USSR are very sorely oppressed in their attempts to escape from that country. Nobody takes up their case in the same way as the South African case is highlighted. The same is true in parts of India, where the Untouchables still do not lead a very happy existence. I only wish that India would set her own house in order before attacking South Africa.<lb/>
I wish also to look&#x2014;other speakers have mentioned it, so I shall not do so in detail&#x2014; at the creation of the naval facilities from the North-East corner of the continent of Africa right the way down: Massawa, Assab, Socotra, The Seychelles, Diego-Suarez, on the north coast of Madagascar, and Maputo. These and other ports have facilities that are increasingly being used by Soviet vessels. We have had 30 years of the new form of Soviet imperialism. This started in the 1950s, 30 years ago. From 1955 to 1978, 15,000 African military personnel were flown to Moscow and trained in military duties; 13,700 African students were flown to Moscow&#x2014;and 12,000 of those came, by the way, from Central and Southern Africa. During the past 20 years Moscow has spent &#x00A3;&#x00BD; billion upon the training of third world students. What an example to the free world. Why are we not spending a similar amount of money in order to provide facilities for students?<lb/>
From 1973 to 1977 Soviet arms supplied to Africa totalled 3,645 million dollars, or 3&#x00B7;84 billion dollars. United States arms supplies amounted to one-seventh of that total. It is no good blaming the United States of America for these arms supplies. They came preponderantly from the Soviets. Libya received 3 billion dollars-worth of weapons which they have used in other countries and have passed on. We heard from the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, of the case (not mentioned in the "Panorama" programme) of the three aircraft flying from Libya to Nicaragua. Annual arms deliveries by Moscow to African countries have gone up steadily. In 1974&#x2014;only 9 years ago&#x2014;they amounted to 240 million dollars. By 1978 they amounted to 2,400 million dollars&#x2014;10 times as much. And in 1981 over 9,000 million dollars-worth of arms were supplied by Moscow to African countries.<lb/>
I turn now to Cuba. Cuba plays a predominant part in many fragile areas where it is stirring up trouble. It is astonishing that, since the Soviets took over complete control of Cuba, Cuba should have posed as a non-aligned country. It was in 1968 that the Soviets undertook a blockade of Cuba. Eventually they were in desperate straits and had to give way. Castro has been a complete satellite of the Soviets ever since. It astonishes me that Castro should be the chairman of a non-aligned group. It does not sound as though they have examined his credentials very carefully. The fact that Castro was almost alone in supporting the
<col>100</col>
invasion of Afghanistan suggests that he is very much a tool of Moscow.<lb/>
Moscow has encouraged, equipped and trained the Cuban troops who are now deployed in Africa. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued a paper (I do not have one dated later than March 1982) which showed that 32,000 Cuban troops were now deployed in Africa&#x2014;a very substantial force. Of these, 22,000 were deployed in propping up the MPLA Government in Angola. Another 3,000 troops were sent there only a few months ago. I do not know why they were sent to Angola; no explanation was given. In addition, 6,000 Cuban civilians are working in Angola and 1,000 Soviet troops are stationed there, most of them close to the Namibian border. I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, who suggested that there would have been a settlement in Namibia if it had not been for South Africa.<lb/>
I would point out that the MPLA Government, under Cuban tutelage, controls only about one-third of Angola. Large numbers of Soviet troops are deployed in Angola, mainly in the south on the Namibian border. Noble Lords will recall that only about six months ago in a South African raid over the border two Soviet uniformed troops were captured. In addition, 1,000 East German troops are in Angola, mainly in the south, training the SWAPO guerrillas. There are many people who are stirring up trouble in Angola. It is an oversimplification to suggest that South Africa alone is the trouble.<lb/>
The second biggest contingent is in the Horn, where 13,000 Cuban troops are deployed in Ethiopia. They of course have massive Soviet supplies and Soviet military advisers. There are 1,000 Cubans in Mozambique, and there are little groups all over the African continent. As my noble friend pointed out, 12 of the 40 African states are now controlled by communist Governments.<lb/>
It is also interesting to see the broadcasting effort. I have not had time to study what it is that we are doing, but I have looked at the American effort and compared it with the Russian effort. Radio Moscow now beams 170 hours every week to Africa, and more than 50 per cent. of that output is in the local African languages. Compared with that figure, the United States broadcasts only 100 hours, and I am afraid that the majority of that broadcasting is in English&#x2014;or the American version of it.<lb/>
I have concentrated on Africa, but I could equally tell the same story in the Middle East, which we are deeply dependent upon, or talk about Central America, as my noble friend has done. I wonder whether, in concentrating on NATO's front door&#x2014;which is the central front of Europe&#x2014;we are possibly neglecting NATO's Achilles' heel, which is the areas where the Soviets are concentrating and which supply us with oil and other raw materials. I suggest that the free world must get together. I do not know whether NATO is the right instrument, because perhaps a military command is a little too set in its ways, habits and structure. Perhaps, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, suggested, the EEC might be a little more flexible. But surely it is possible for the free world to get together to consider how we can counter this wave of Soviet effort, via Cuba, on the African continent.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0059"/>
<col>101</col>
Can we not jointly look at the questions of students, broadcasts, teachers, agriculturalists to solve some of the desperately difficult food problems on that continent, medical help and a whole host of other ways of trying to relieve those countries, and attempt to restore some respect for the Western European countries who were for so long their colonial powers? After an interval now, when these African countries have perhaps tasted a nasty alternative, we may have more effect than we did when we first withdrew. It is a desperate problem and I hope that the free world will look at it seriously as a result of this debate and consider what constructive efforts can be made to get together and achieve some results.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00557">4.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00558"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not only within this House but also outside it, many people will be grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for having given us an opportunity to discuss this vitally important subject and for having opened this debate in such an admirable way. We have a chance to talk about what is an enormously important matter and we also have the chance&#x2014;as has been shown by the speeches to which we have listened already&#x2014;to hear many different points of view.<lb/>
I believe that none of us can disagree with the thesis that the Soviet Union poses a real threat in the third world, and it is one that many people have ignored for far too long. I was interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, give his factual survey of Latin America and the Caribbean&#x2014;an area that I know reasonably well. With nothing that he said, and with none of his facts, did I disagree. But when the noble Lord said that the chain begins with Cuba, if the noble Lord was speaking chronologically, then I would disagree fundamentally. My understanding of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos&#x2014;not that he needs me to defend him at all&#x2014;is that it in no way suggested that the danger was due to neglect on the part of the United States or other people; the danger stems originally from the Soviet Union. I believe that none of us would disagree with that.<lb/>
But why is it that in certain parts of the Caribbean, and particularly in Latin America, the Soviet Union has been able to make such advances? I believe it is because of the gross inequalities of life and the standard of living which have existed there and which continue to exist there, and the unwillingness or inabilility of the great neighbouring power of the United States to do anything to improve conditions there and its apparent willingness and desire to support those who are the protagonists of that inequality.<lb/>
I hope that I shall not weary your Lordships if I describe three personal reminiscences from Latin America from about 20 years ago&#x2014;because this memory goes back a very long time indeed. On one occasion I was in a large city in Latin America and I was entertained to a cocktail party there by a prominent citizen. I was driven through slums which are impossible to imagine unless one has actually seen them&#x2014;slums where people live not in tin shacks made out of old petrol cans but in shelters made out of cardboard packing cases, so that when it rains the shelters simply disappear into the mud.<lb/>
<col>102</col>
Having driven through several kilometres of such slums, I came to a pair of great iron gates. These were flung open, and then the car in which I was travelling swept up to a marble staircase. I walked up the marble staircase and the front doors were thrown open by flunkeys. Inside, my host was waiting with his guests to greet me wearing, I am somewhat ashamed to say, an Old Etonian tie. As we sipped champagne, he mentionesd to me, just <i>en passant,</i> that he was fortunate in having two Rolls-Royces because it was impossible to have them serviced in that particular country. But as he also owned a shipping line, he was able to send one Rolls-Royce back to England to be serviced while he used the other. Thus he was always able to use one of these cars at his convenience.<lb/>
My second recollection is of a public works contractor whose plantation I visited&#x2014;bananas, oil palms, coconuts and so on&#x2014;extended to many thousands of hectares. Again, his workers lived in abject squalor and poverty. He told me, as we sat together after lunch, that he had been able to amass in liquid resources some 6 million dollars. He had wisely placed 2 million dollars on Wall Street and in Switzerland. He then kept 2 million dollars for his own use within that country, and he had 2 million dollars set aside for the support of that political party which was going to maintain the system whereby he had made his money.<lb/>
My third recollection was a visit to General Anastasio Samoza in his bunker. He was the head of state, and despite the fact that the country was supposedly at peace, he had to live in conditions of security which must have rivalled those of Hitler. There were normal sentries at normal gates, but then there were steel doors, and a long passage leading to a circular room. This was completely windowless but air-coniditioned and furnished with a large desk where the dictator sat at the far end.<lb/>
Those are conditions which have existed for generations in Latin America. What has the United States done to encourage those who want to improve upon them? Its record&#x2014;and I am saddened to say this&#x2014;is lamentable. Take Chile. There was a good, reforming, liberal Government of Eduardo Frei. When that was replaced by the less practical, more reforming Government of Dr. Allende it did not last long, because it was not in the interests of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation of America, and it was not in the interests of the big copper concerns there. Before very long Allende was out, and in came the man we now have, General Pinochet, with his suppressive r&#x00E9;gime, his secret police, his dictatorial and terrorist powers throughout the whole country. To the world at large, and certainly to Latin America, it looks as if it is the United States which has engineered, supported and encouraged that, just as it had hob-nobbed and made good relations, until the short episode of the Falklands, with similarly oppressive and dictatorial military juntas in Argentina.<lb/>
Before that, what happened when Batista was overthrown in Cuba? We have heard a lot about Cuba. I am not defending the r&#x00E9;gime there, although I have much sympathy with many of the things it has been trying to do. But I certainly have no sympathy with what preceded it&#x2014;the r&#x00E9;gime of Batista, with its
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0060"/>
<col>103</col>
corruption, its vices, its gangsterism, its poverty and its vast and ostentatious riches. But when Castro and his friends overthrew Batista, the United States lost a wonderful chance. It did not hold out the hand of friendship. It did not say, "You, at least, are trying to improve things and bring your country a little bit more towards the sort of democracy that we have in the United States". Because Castro nationalised the sugar plantations and interfered with great American interests, your Lordships know how he was treated. Bit by bit and faster and faster he was forced from the ambit of the United States into the arms of the Soviet Union, with all that has resulted from it.<lb/>
That is the situation as I see it that has led to this problem in Latin America today; and, alas&#x0021;, the United States does not seem to have learned any lesson at all, but is still pursuing a policy which is encouraging those who have supported, profited and grown fat from the old regimes, and is ignoring or helping the fight against those who are trying to bring about social reforms. If the United States continues to do that, it will either find itself involved in a new Vietnam&#x2014;it is determined not to do that, but whether or not it will succeed I do not know&#x2014;or it will lose its struggle; but by losing it will make the countries of Central America even more vulnerable than they are now to Cuba and the Russian menace.<lb/>
I will just say in passing that I cannot go along with the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, in his remarks about the article in <i>The Times</i> by Anthony Lewis, so rightly quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos. I cannot remember his precise words, but I should like to put on record that, as far as I am concerned, Anthony Lewis is an extremely able and objective journalist, and a very well informed journalist. I do not believe that anything he writes is written out of political pique or personal vindictiveness.<lb/>
Let us now turn to Africa, which is the other main area about which we have been speaking. Again, the menace here is the Soviet Union; that is the danger. If I may again be forgiven for a reminiscence, my mind goes back to 1968 or 1969, when I was having a personal talks with the then Prime Minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster. We were discussing the problem of apartheid and its effect on other parts of Africa south of the Sahara. I said to him that the time would come within the next 10 or 15 years when Haile Selassie would disappear and it would be a disaster for the West&#x2014;perhaps that was putting it too strongly&#x2014;if Ethiopia fell into hands that were friendly to the Soviet Union. That has happened. I said that in Kenya there would be a change. I said that Kenyatta would go and that, again, there was the danger that this might happen. Fortunately, it has not happened. I told Mr. Vorster that Salazar would disappear, that Mozambique and Angola would no longer be under the thumb of Portugal, and that they would be vulnerable to Soviet influence.<lb/>
I still believe, as I did then, that those things could all have been avoided had South Africa pursued a different policy&#x2014;a policy which turns its back on apartheid, which accepts blacks as equals with whites and has an expansionist policy towards Africa as a whole and towards its own black inhabitants. Of course, we also have Namibia. So I repeat that while I
<col>104</col>
believe it is the Soviet Union which is the menace and the threat, its unconscious and unwilling allies in its activities are the United States and South Africa, with their existing policies.<lb/>
I believe that the African situation is not as bad as the noble Earl depicted. There are the Russian bases that he talked about, and it is not good for us that they should be there; but I cannot believe that if a hot war developed those bases would be very stable, given the situation of Africa and the attitude of Africans, and given our own history in Africa. After all, for many years in the 1950s and 1960s Russia strove to extend its influence in Africa but met with almost complete failure. There is now a form of communist state in Tanzania, but that is no threat to us because there is there the tradition&#x2014;which, I am proud to say, we left behind from this country&#x2014;of tolerance, justice and peace. Although it is sad to see a country potentially as rich as that and with a man as essentially good as Julius Nyerere going through the hardships brought about by its own inefficiencies and its own adherence to dogma, it is not a threat to the West and it is not a threat to us.<lb/>
In this state of affairs we should pay tribute to those who were instrumental in building up the new Commonwealth as we know it now. Credit must be given&#x2014;and I willingly and happily give it&#x2014;to Harold Macmillan, Reginald Maudling, Iain Macleod and Alan Lennox-Boyd (for whose life we gave thanks yesterday) and, before them, to Clement Attlee, for his role in India; to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, the last Secretary of State for India in this country; and to people like Malcolm MacDonald. It is such people, I believe, who have created in Africa as a whole this atmosphere which is so very different from that which obtains in Latin America today and which I believe is our greatest bulwark against the spread of communism. But it is not an invincible bulwark by any means. We must continuously fight to see that the battle is maintained.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, was right to say that we should increase our scholarships and have more students from those countries. We should increase our aid and technical assistance, as most of us pressed last week in the debate of the noble Lord, Lord Oram, which, alas, was singularly unsupported by noble Lords opposite. We must continue with that, because it is a fight from which we can never relax. But we must also be candid with our friends and our allies in the United States. They are friends, of course; they are relatives; they are the closest country to us and we are the closest country to them. Neither of us can survive without the other. I know full well that it is part of the strategy of the Soviet Union to try to drive a wedge between us. I do not know whether any of your Lordships read an article in the <i>Observer</i> the Sunday before last by a very influential Russian journalist, Alexander Bovin, who was over here on a visit. He wrote in regard to the Americans&#x2014;and, regrettably, it has a germ of truth in it:
<quote>"A minimum of foreign policy experience multiplied by a minimum of general culture results in a maximum of self-assurance".</quote>
We would not say that to them, but I think we must agree that there is some truth in it. It is for us to assert ourselves as candid friends, as close allies and as
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0061"/>
<col>105</col>
people tied by blood as well as by interests, and point out to them where their errors lie and where their present policy, particularly in Latin America, is leading them and is leading us. If we do not do that, we shall fail in our responsibilities as a member of that great alliance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00559">4.51 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00560"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a great temptation to follow and pick up the points that have been raised in a succession of obsessive speeches, apparently sparked off by a psychosis of fear over the Soviet Union. I shall resist that temptation, but there are one or two issues which have been raised to which I feel I must reply. First, to the last speaker, the noble Lord, Lord Walston, I would just say in regard to Tanzania that if Tanzania is a communist country, it is the only communist country that I know of that has regular five-year elections in which, on every occasion, Ministers and members of the Assembly are defeated. When he puts the blame for the economic ills of Tanzania on inefficiency and their inability to develop their economy, may I just point out to him that, at this year's prices, it will take 10 times as much sisal (which is the main crop in Tanzania) to buy one tractor as it did 10 years ago.<lb/>
On one or two other issues that have been raised, may I first of all address myself to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, who initiated this debate, and again, as other speakers have done, thank him for introducing it. All I want to say to him is that I was sorry that he did not pursue the beginning of his speech. This could have been a fascinating debate if he had pursued the approach that the Soviet Union was failing in trade in Africa and examined why and to what extent the Western world can succeed where the Soviet Union has failed. I was sorry that he did not pursue that. But to the extent that the Soviet Union is failing&#x2014;and I agree with him on this and shall have more to say on it in a few minutes&#x2014;in trade in Africa, it is not failing in the way that he suggested&#x2014;I took his words down and I think I report him correctly&#x2014;when he said that the Soviet Union cannot satisfy the needs of private enterprise. No, it is not private enterprise that the Soviet Union cannot satisfy; it is the needs of the people of Africa. I want to return to that later.<lb/>
I would also take issue with the noble Earl on what he said and on what has been said since about the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. I am not going to deal with the Horn, not because I want to dodge it but because I know the other area so much better. There were no Cuban troops in Angola until South African troops invaded Angola. This has been testified to by the CIA itself. The Cuban troops were asked for by the Angolan Government to protect the Government and the people of Angola against an invasion by South African troops. There is no doubt&#x2014;and I do not think that anyone would doubt this&#x2014;that the Angolan Government do not want to retain Cuban troops. There is a general detestation throughout the African continent for the presence of foreign troops on African soil. But, if those Cuban troops are withdrawn from Angola, is not Angola then left, as it was in 1975, at the mercy of further South African invasions?<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing&#x2014;and perhaps someone will draw this to his attention as he is not in
<col>106</col>
his place&#x2014;talks about what is going on on the boundary between Namibia and Angola, but the whole Cunene province of Angola (which is the southern province on the boundary with Namibia) is occupied by South African troops. It is nonsense to try to close our eyes to that fact. Remember, we have a responsibility. Since 1977 the British Government have been part of the contact group. But that area of Angola is occupied by the South Africans. Until those South African troops are withdrawn and are also withdrawn from Namibia, you cannot expect any Angolan Government to ask the Cuban troops to go home, which they would like to do.<lb/>
I may just point out here that when talking about Cuban troops in Angola, one should not forget that there are French troops in many ex-French colonial states in Africa. To take the words of the noble Earl himself when he mentioned Belize, yes, we are all glad that there are British troops in Belize&#x2014;with the consent of the Belize Government. It is a sovereign state. So is Angola. The Cuban troops who are in Angola are performing the same function as the British troops in Belize.<lb/>
I said that I should not be drawn by the later speeches, which have&#x2014;I am sorry&#x2014;in my view deteriorated a little from the standard of the opening speeches. In each of those opening speeches, I was encouraged by the concept&#x2014;instead of this debate simply being a medium for attacking the Soviet Union&#x2014;that the West and the communist <i>bloc</i> should be working together for the good of the third world countries that we are discussing. It is in that spirit that I want to make my contribution, rather than with all this fear of what the Soviet Union is doing in the third world.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Walston, said that everyone would agree that the real threat was the Soviet Union. Frankly, I do not agree. I do not agree at all. I have fairly good qualifications for not agreeing. I cut my political teeth in debating for years and years with Willie Gallagher, the last Communist Member of the other place. I have seen the Soviet Union at work during the many times that I have been living in third world countries. I am not frightened of it. I want to see the Soviet Union developing its cultural contributions, its economic contributions, and its ideological contributions, because I believe that the clash of ideas between what I would put forward as democratic socialism and the form of communist propaganda which is put out by the Soviet Union is productive.<lb/>
Let me refer to three personal experiences. I believe that my best contribution to the debate is what I can mention from personal experience, and it will point out the main issue which I want to raise. It is just about 12 months ago since I was in the middle of a crisis at the University of Zambia. The university administration did not handle the crisis very well; it was frightened. The crisis stemmed from a very small group of students who, with a little wisdom, could very easily have been isolated, or have been allowed to have their say. They called themselves Marxists-Leninists. But they had no idea what either Marxism or Leninism meant. I went to lecture to them. I deliberately took the opportunity to lecture to them on the significance of Marx to the third world. The standard of their understanding of Marx was illustrated by the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0062"/>
<col>107</col>
fact that they indignantly denied that their great hero Marx could ever have written for an American capitalist newspaper, whereas of course anybody who knows anything about Marx knows that one has to read the <i>New York Tribune</i> if one is to understand what Marx had to say.<lb/>
That situation was not a threat. It is true that the Soviet Embassy in Lusaka provided books to the university, and that that very small group of students&#x2014;no more than half a dozen&#x2014;would repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> phrases that they had taken from these books that really became meaningless. That was no threat. What was a threat was that there was nothing on the other side, that the country did not have the foreign exchange to import books from the other side, and that therefore the university bookstall shelves were empty. In Lusaka itself the shelves emptied before my eyes during the two years that I spent there. That was the danger, and that was the threat. It was not the Soviet publications. It was the absence of the ability of the Zambians to import publications from the West.<lb/>
When we are talking about armaments I would say that I detest just as much as does anybody else in the House the rise in armament buying by the third world. But there, up in the sky above the university were the Russian MiGs. Why? I was actually in the office of the Minister of Defence on one occasion when news came that 33 South African planes loaded with bombs were approaching the country. Why?&#x2014;because of misinformation that a camp of Namibian refugees was actually a camp of Namibian guerrillas. Fortunately the South African Government were convinced in time, and the bombs were jettisoned on the border between Zambia and Namibia. That is why the MiGs were in the skies. But if our Government here had been providing the protection for Zambia, there would have been no MiGs.<lb/>
Secondly, I move to a matter on which I believe that I shall be supported by my noble friend Lord Stewart of Fulham, since he was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the time of the Nigerian civil war. I think that my noble friend Lord Stewart will bear me out when I say that one of the most important issues that brought the Soviet Union's influence into West Africa was the stand which the Soviet Union made over the Nigerian civil war. As the Soviet ambassador in Lagos explained to me at the time, this was the classical consequence of what he&#x2014;and he was the dean of the Diplomatic Corps at the time&#x2014;had read into the teachings of Lenin on nationalism: that one recognised national sovereignty, that one did not interfere with national boundaries, and that one gave no form of support to secessionist movements. As a result of that policy the Soviet Union became very popular with the Nigerians.<lb/>
Our Government took the same line in supporting the federal Government as against the secessionists. But there were many sections of our political society which took a different line, and indeed there were many sections of the American community which also took a different line. So our impact was not as strong as the complete support that was given by the Soviet Union at that time.<lb/>
The third instance that I would offer to this House is that of Guinea&#x2014;and here I am talking about Guinea
<col>108</col>
based on Conakry, as distinct from Guinea-Bissau. I happened to be in the State Department in Washington at the time that S&#x00E9;kou Tour&#x00E9; held his joint independence day and party congress, in November 1978. The State Department was quite excited about the event. It had sent a high level delegation to the conference. This was in the days when Mr. Moose was in charge of the State Department under the presidency of Mr. Carter. When I returned to this country I immediately went to see Dr. Owen, who was then the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to find out what we had done. I discovered that we had sent our ambassador from Dakar in Senegal. He had not stayed for the whole conference, and he had not met S&#x00E9;kou Tour&#x00E9;.<lb/>
For some time after that I tried very hard to persuade, first, the Labour Government, and then the succeeding Conservative Government, that Guinea was important. It was important because of what happened way back in 1968. Your Lordships may recall that S&#x00E9;kou Tour&#x00E9; was completely cut off by de Gaulle because he had refused to join the French community. Even the electric light bulbs were pulled out of the offices, all the files were emptied, and the country was stripped. S&#x00E9;kou Tour&#x00E9; went to Washington. He came here, too, and he spoke at Chatham House. He went to West Germany, and he could gain no support at all of any substantial nature from the West. So what did he do? He did the only thing that he could do. He turned to the Soviet Union. It took him 20 years to find out that he was getting a raw deal from the Soviet Union, a raw deal in trade and in technical assistance; and his country was simply not developing.<lb/>
I continued the campaign to try to get this country to take Guinea seriously. It is potentially a very wealthy country. The Americans took it very seriously, and so did the French, very quickly. Giscard went on a State visit, and the French very quickly had a delegation at the party conference. The Japanese were there. The Germans were there. Where were we? As I pointed out to the Government, we had in Conakry an honorary consul, who had very great difficulty in speaking English.<lb/>
Fortunately, things have improved a little. I believe that if there had not been an election in this country in 1979, we would have had an ambassador in Conakry. We have not. We still depend on the ambassador in Dakar. Here are great opportunities for the Western world. I know from my own conversations with S&#x00E9;kou Tour&#x00E9;, who has invited me twice to his country, that he wants to get help from this country. He wants to have joint ventures with this country. A tremendous opportunity exists for joint development. It is not being taken. Fortunately, we now have in London an honourary Guinea consul, Mr. Lunzer.<lb/>
Mr. Lunzer, who is doing an excellent job for Guinea, would be the first to agree that this arrangement is only a poor substitute for full diplomatic relations between the two countries with an ambassador here and an ambassador in Conakry. This is the way in which the West has given, and continues to give, invitations to the Soviet Union to provide technical help, economic help and, above all, military help. It is our fault.<lb/>
If the Government, having shown themselves so insensitive to the importance of recognising overseas
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0063"/>
<col>109</col>
aid as investment, continue to follow the line that they have done in, say, Grenada, where they have refused to help to finance any new projects, where their aid has declined from &#x00A3;252,000 in 1979 to &#x00A3;83,000 in 1981 and where they refused to help with the building of the airfield that is essential for the tourist trade and not for the military&#x2014;a fact recognised by 13 other Western European states and four Arab states, but not by us&#x2014;and if the Government continue to prefer to provide an airstrip on the Cayman Islands in order to enable the casino for Club M&#x00E9;diterran&#x00E9;e to be built, then they cannot complain if countries of this kind turn to Moscow, to Peking or to East Germany for the help that we refuse. That is where the danger is.<lb/>
Let us have an open competition. Let us have an open dialogue and an open argument. I was talking about this very subject to the Soviet ambassador a few weeks ago. I asked him about Soviet aid to the developing world. He has sent me the paper that was submitted to the United Nations Economic and Social Council for Europe. I shall place a copy in the Library. I do not say that the paper is correct. But, then, I do not say that the figures given by noble Lords representing the Government or those given by Washington are necessarily correct.<lb/>
I should, however, like to assure the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, who opened the debate, that he can rest assured that there are no pro-Soviet r&#x00E9;gimes in Africa. There are r&#x00E9;gimes that will get assistance from the Soviet Union. There are regimes that will get assistance from Washington, London or Paris. But African culture is so old and deeply-rooted and the Africans sufficiently empirical that they will take what is appropriate for them. This does not mean that they are pro-Soviet or pro-Washington, pro-London or pro-Paris.<lb/>
If we fail to recognise the responsibility that we have to associate ourselves in the development of half the world's population, we cannot complain if the leaders of those countries turn to other countries to get the assistance that they need to sustain their people.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00562"><member>Baroness Airey of Abingdon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had an extremely interesting debate. All your Lordships will, I think, agree that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for instigating the debate, in my opinion not a moment too soon. There have been many different opinions expressed about different parts of the world. I should like to speak mainly about the Horn of Africa. I should especially like to associate myself with my noble friend when he paid tribute to Mr. Louis Fitzgibbon for the immense amount of work that he did in assembling his three reports and book that won the first Airey Neave memorial prize. Perhaps I am allowed to tell your Lordships that the theme of the prize was freedom under the law. I have noticed, listening with great interest to so many speeches today, that there is the underlying feeling that, whatever one's opinions, freedom under the law is very important.<lb/>
In my youth, Africa appeared a very mysterious place, especially when I first married. My father-in-law, as a scientist and an entomologist, seemed a rather alarming person. But I learned quickly to listen with great interest to descriptions of the work that he
<col>110</col>
and his father, also an entomologist and a doctor, had done researching tsetse fly and sleeping sickness in Africa. This was how my interest in the continent first arose. My friendship with Africans was established when I met Alan Lennox-Boyd in the early 1950s. At that time he was Colonial Secretary and my husband became his PPS. It was moving yesterday in Westminster Abbey to hear Lord Home's splendid tribute to Lord Boyd. When he spoke about Lord Boyd's breadth of vision, I thought to myself how much we miss him. We miss him today, especially in this debate. Lord Home also spoke about his hospitality. I feel deeply about this.<lb/>
As I was the young and inexperienced wife of a new Member of Parliament, he almost always asked me to dinner. On many of those occasions I met Africans who were his friends. Always the conversation turned to the problems in their countries. Sometimes, late at night, when the other guests had gone home, Airey and I stayed to talk with Lord Boyd and his wife. I remember well the anxiety with which Lord Boyd, in those days as Colonial Secretary, spoke about the future of that continent, and especially the Horn of Africa. So I know that all of us miss him very much.<lb/>
Of course, the situation was very different in those days, but I still believe that the Soviet Union was thinking and planning, and how deeply they have planned and how quickly they have moved. I am sure that in those days they were thinking about oil and access to the Indian Ocean, which is their aim today, as well as access to the warm water ports.<lb/>
I should like to speak particularly about the Horn of Africa and in that connection there is the question of the pincer movement. Anyone who looks at a modern atlas or who reads the newspapers will realise how dangerous the situation has become. There is the question of Afghanistan. Although reports vary very much about the situation in Afghanistan, those of us who saw the programme on television last night came to realise that many, many towns and villages are now in Soviet hands. There are a number of people who say that the Soviet Union are doing awfully badly in Afghanistan, but I think that that is a type of front. There are many important places which are strongly in their hands. There is that difficult pass which we remember from the old days when we were in power in India. It is a stronghold and at the moment an impossibility for them to conquer. But behind all this I think that they are building up a very strong force. As has been mentioned this afternoon, they have already built an airstrip which is only 100 miles from the sea and only 600 miles from their great goal. Therefore, they are not being idle. The pincer movement is in action and we should not fail to pay attention to it. That is why in my view we should consider very carefully the situation in the Horn of Africa.<lb/>
I have a son at present in Singapore and I have been to see him there. That place is particularly interesting to me in the same way as places of which noble Lords have spoken with great knowledge this afternoon are of great interest to them. However it is interesting to me that in 1979, when the Soviet Union entered Afghanistan, Singapore barred all Soviet naval ships from her shipyards, thus depriving them of victualling and ship repair facilities which were previously available. Lee Kuan Yew is a man of great foresight. I
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0064"/>
<col>111</col>
do not believe that he would have taken that action if he had not foreseen a danger in the Indian Ocean. So here again there is a worldwide danger which has been so brilliantly and explicitly spoken about this afternoon.<lb/>
As regards the Indian Ocean many people have mentioned the number of ships there belonging to the Soviet Union. I believe that there are at least 500 Russian ships in the Pacific fleet alone. In fact, that was reported in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> yesterday. Moreover, they have mounting military strength throughout the Continent of Africa. Let us not be beguiled into thinking that they do not have a long-term plan. They do not need to act quickly, but I believe that they are acting for the future, that they have laid their plans with great cleverness and that they prefer to act behind other people such as their Cuban allies. That has been much demonstrated by many of your Lordships who have spoken this afternoon.<lb/>
I am particularly interested in Mr. Andropov's offer which has been widely reported in today's press. It is a matter of interest that he has made what appears to be a significant offer as regards the number of warheads to be sited in Europe. Again I find that of particular interest in connection with the part of the world about which we are speaking. It may seem strange to some of your Lordships that I mention this, but I equally think that the recollection&#x2014;in many ways the terrible recollection&#x2014;of war which actually came to the gates of Russia itself is still much remembered in that country. Maybe this is a type of diversion and it is much easier for that country to operate behind its friends especially as regards the Horn of Africa, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, so very eloquently said in his excellent speech, as regards South America. So I draw your Lordships' attention to the fact that sometimes what seems to be a very interesting offer has another meaning. Maybe he does not want to operate in Europe; maybe he would rather operate behind others in other quarters of the world.<lb/>
I do not want to keep your Lordships too long this evening. I should like to take the opportunity to say that, in view of the tremendous interest that this debate has generated with so many speakers and with so many interesting matters that they have raised, I very much regret and apologise to the House that it is just possible that I may not be able to stay to hear the winding-up speeches, owing to a very long-standing engagement. It will be of the greatest disappointment to me if I am not able to stay, but if I should have to slip away I crave your Lordships' indulgence and I shall read with the utmost interest the winding-up speeches. However, I beg your Lordships to consider very carefully what aid we can possibly give to those who really have our interests at heart in these dangerous parts of the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00563">5.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00564"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, despite the very wide-ranging scope of the opening speech by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, he has perhaps consciously chosen by the terms of his Motion a comparatively limited aspect of a much wider phenomenon in the post-war world&#x2014;namely, the spread of communism. The noble Earl's Motion deals only with Soviet penetration and
<col>112</col>
influence in the third world, which is but one aspect, I suggest, of a much greater development of communism in the world in general. It is to that broader development that I would like to address my remarks this evening, and perhaps draw a number of conclusions as to how the non-communist world should counter the Soviet influence in the third world.<lb/>
If I may say so, the speeches which have come from the Benches opposite and from the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, have been strong in description of what is seen as the Soviet threat, but very weak in putting forward suggestions as to how that threat should be countered. I think that it was only the noble Lord, Lord On-Ewing, who seemed to be advocating a great increase in our overseas aid programme in providing technical assistance, which warmed my heart. I hope that he will convey those sentiments to those in the Government who can do something about that.<lb/>
On my theme of the development of communism in the post-war world, perhaps a few broad statistics may help to set the two aspects&#x2014;the direct Soviet influence and the spread of communism&#x2014;in some kind of proportion. Before the war there was only one communist state&#x2014;the USSR, with a population at that time of some 200 million, which has now grown to 250 million. Today there are some 20 communist states with a population of over 1&#x00BD; billion people&#x2014;a six-fold increase in a period of 40 years. Today perhaps a third of the population of the world is living under communist Governments, and of those 1&#x00BD; billion, well over 1 billion are in the third world, which we are particularly debating this evening. But I suggest that it is by no means an accurate view of history to ascribe that remarkable increase in communism to Soviet influence, direct or indirect. The Chinese communists would not thank you if you said that their regime was a Soviet creation. The communists of Yugoslavia have established their communist state in spite of, rather than because of, Soviet policies.<lb/>
I should like to take a recent example of a country which is not communist&#x2014;the Philippines. The other day I was reading in <i>The Times</i> a series of articles by that paper's South-East Asia correspondent about the communist movement in the Philippines. He quotes a guerrilla as saying:
<quote>"Filipino-style Communism has a little bit from Mao and a little bit from Marx".</quote>
There was no reference to Moscow, nor even to Lenin, and I think that that gels with what my noble friend Lord Hatch was saying to your Lordships about lack of direct understanding in Africa even of what Marx and orthodox communism is really about.<lb/>
I think it is true to say that, to a very large extent, communist r&#x00E9;gimes&#x2014;particularly those in the third world&#x2014;have come about, not through external influences, but from internal causes. I should like to suggest what some of those causes are. Primarily and without doubt I would say that the first cause is poverty, and particularly poverty among large peasant populations. The origin of that poverty is essentially the landlessness of the peasants and their consequent exploitation by those who do own the land. I believe that to be a basic cause of communism.<lb/>
The second cause&#x2014;which has been referred to particularly by my noble friend Lord Walston&#x2014;is the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0065"/>
<col>113</col>
existence of oppressive and corrupt Governments. Often a third cause of communist revolution has been the burden placed on the people by war. If we look hack in history, we see that those were the causes of the Russian revolution; those were the conditions in Russia which enabled Lenin and his Bolshevik colleagues to seize power. Basically, the same conditions were to be found in China when Mao led his communist armies to victory. We should learn from history in these matters.<lb/>
Unfortunately, today it is all too common to find countries which are poverty-stricken, with peasant populations deprived of land and with Governments maintaining those conditions through oppressive dictatorships. It is not difficult to identify in Latin America, in South-East Asia or in Africa the equivalent of the Russian serf or of the Chinese peasant. Nor is it difficult to find Governments today as repressive as those of the Czar or of Chiang Kai-shek. It is when whole populations suffer from such grievances that communist parties emerge and take power, because they can identify themselves in their propaganda and in their own communist interests with the general grievances of the peasant populations. They promise to overcome those conditions of poverty and of landlessness, and in doing so they often find themselves in common cause with other more liberal sectors of society.<lb/>
Nicaragua has been referred to several times. To take an example, in Nicaragua, in a Government which President Reagan characterises as Marxist, there are Catholics supported by large sections of the Catholic priesthood. They see it as their Christian duty to minister to the needs of the poverty-stricken peasants, and it is for that reason that the communists often find allies on their path to power.<lb/>
As I have already said, I was reading in <i>The Times</i> the other day a series of articles by Mr. David Watts, the paper's South-East Asia correspondent, about the Philippines. I was struck by the headline of his second article. It asks the question:
<quote>"What makes priests into revolutionaries?"</quote>
His article explains what drives priests into united action with the communist New People's Army. On another theme, his first article has an equally incisive headline. It refers to the
<quote>"purge of peasants as if Vietnam had never been".</quote>
His concluding paragraph is I think worth quoting. It says:
<quote>"In one recent sweep through three hamlets, the army so terrorised the population that 200 families fled. Hearts and minds will never he salvaged this way".</quote>
I suggest that that is the fundamental lesson that America took many long, painful years to learn in Vietnam, and I suggest that that it is why voices are being raised in America today against President Reagan's policies in Central America, which threaten a similar mistake to those of Vietnam.<lb/>
Therefore, if we reject&#x2014;as I firmly believe we should&#x2014;the military answer to communism&#x2014;which, in my judgment, was so dramatically proved to be wrong in South East Asia and which, if tried, will surely equally be proved wrong in Central America&#x2014;what is it that we must do to prevent the
<col>114</col>
emergence of oppressive communist r&#x00E9;gimes in the third world? First, I suggest that we should analyse and understand more thoroughly the causes of communism, as I have tried to describe them. Do not let us be so obsessed, as some speakers seem to have been today, with the Soviet threat. The causes of communism are much deeper and more widespread than Soviet foreign policy or Soviet penetration. What we must do is to tackle the root causes of communism: world poverty, as I have suggested, and especially the landless state of the mass peasant populations. That is why I was saying in your Lordships' House a week ago&#x2014;and a number of noble Lords have referred to the debate&#x2014;that the proposals of the Brandt Commission for overcoming the problems of the third world must be implemented if disaster is to be avoided.<lb/>
Secondly, what I suggest we must do is to show that in practice there is a better way than the communist way. We must take action on a massive scale to demonstrate to the people of the third world that it is we, the democratic West, who can help them develop their economies in the interests of their own people, and that this can be done by the process of genuine democracy. When we uphold, as we must, the values of freedom&#x2014;freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom to choose Governments, freedom to travel&#x2014;and when we point out that these basic freedoms are denied by communists, we must, I suggest, at the same time ensure that the economic and social freedoms of the people are equally there. If, indeed, you offer a starving man the choice between a vote and a loaf, there is no doubt what his choice will be. But it is my view that we should make sure that he is not faced with that choice. We should enable him to have both the vote and the loaf.<lb/>
Surely, this means that our objective, and the objective of the third world countries themselves, is their industrial, agricultural, economic and social development by democratic means. We must face up to the consequences of helping them along the paths of democracy. If the practice of true democracy in those countries leads straight away, as I believe it must, to a demand for land reform, the distribution of land among the landless peasants, then so be it; let us have vigorous programmes of land reform. In relation to industrial development funded from our aid programmes, if the practice of democracy means that profits from that investment can be repatriated to the West only to a limited extent and that the profits should be reinvested in the third world economies, then again I say so be it. If the practice of democracy in these third world countries leads to rich countries&#x2014;ourselves included&#x2014;being required to pay more for the commodities produced by the developing countries, once again, so be it, because we have had those commodities on the cheap for two centuries or more.<lb/>
Above all, if we wish to forestall communism in the third world, we must choose very carefully the political partners with whom we are prepared to work. If we are seen to favour dictatorships and oppressive Government r&#x00E9;gimes, this will be an easy and significant propaganda boost for the communists. The struggle against communism is, in the long run, the battle for men's hearts and minds. On that phrase, I would conclude by quoting just once again from Mr. David
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0066"/>
<col>115</col>
Watts in <i>The Times</i> of last Wednesday. The communists, he says,
<quote>"do not have to search for rallying issues. Most are created for them by low wages and government policies which force more and more peasants off their lands in favour of agri-business interests &#x00B7; The landless become potential recruits for the [communist] New People's Army".</quote>
I remind you, my Lords, in conclusion, of his concluding sentence:
<quote>"Hearts and minds will never be salvaged this way."</quote>
I would add that communism will not be resisted that way.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00566"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Oram, who leaves the order of debate on such a high plane. Before I do so, may I first apologise to your Lordships that, owing to a long-standing engagement, I shall not be able to stay beyond a certain hour. Of course, I shall read all your Lordships' speeches in <i>Hansard.</i> In mitigation, I have never had to ask your Lordships' indulgence before in this regard. I apologise.<lb/>
At the outset, I would wish to thank my noble friend Lord Cathcart for setting the scene for this debate by his authoritative and impressive <i>tour d'horizon</i> of a subject which affects the freedom of man to live as he would wish. I would wish to concentrate on Africa as distinct from Central America, the problems being disparate. If Brandt I and Brandt II make the point that the frontiers of European ex-colonial states in Africa lie in Europe, so be it. Such is the identifiable antidote to the thesis that we should close our pursestrings to the poor and undeveloped countries&#x2014;a thesis already robustly rejected by notable speeches in the recent debate on Brandt II in your Lordships' House and in particular, if I may say so with respect, in a memorable contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos.<lb/>
Indeed, is it not really idle to pretend that, while retaining a "credible deterrent", if the political will and the common policies of the European institutions had extended beyond the limitations of Lom&#x00E9;, beyond <i>ad hoc</i> aid, to encompass the dimensions of Brandt I, the history of Soviet penetration in these countries could not have been otherwise&#x2014;and this notwithstanding the staggering extent of the arms supplies and the sending of advisers to which my noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing has referred?<lb/>
Indeed, if one puts aside for a moment the dilemma situation in Central Africa&#x2014;perhaps a different problem&#x2014;is it not only by diplomatic initiative on a European scale, backed by a credible deterrent and a broad implementation of Brandt II, that such penetrations (unsought, unwelcomed, unprovoked) may now be contained or prevented? Here I associate myself with what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, that military intervention is in no way appropriate in this respect. However&#x2014;and I think perhaps this is where the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, and I might have to part company&#x2014;if the Western alliance were to be slighted, if the European Communities were to be dismembered, then we could find ourselves one day like the companions of Menelaus&#x2014;fishing with bent hooks for hunger in our
<col>116</col>
belly. The status of these European institutions could indeed resolve itself, in the Soviet design, into the question of whether Europe serves as a staging post or as a stumbling block. Either way, there is no rosy-fingered dawn and the wine-dark sea continues to harbour engines of massive and instantaneous destruction.<lb/>
Are not the Soviet activities in Africa to be seen as part and parcel of an overall policy of attrition by threat which embraces Central Africa, as has been expounded by the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, and the threat in the Middle East, as deployed with terrifying lucidity by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, who I see in his place? Albeit that this threat is varied as regards time, incidence and intensity, it is always sustained. Surely the acquisition of these port facilities on the East Coast of Africa, referred to in some detail by my noble friend Lord Cathcart, is not directed to territorial claims as such. The lines of communication are far too long and, of all nations, the Soviets know about long lines of communication&#x2014;a point hinted at by the noble Lord, Lord Walston. The acquisition of these facilities is surely to pose a threat to the oil route from the Gulf to the Cape, and to destabilise our trade.<lb/>
Part and parcel of the greater threat was the sales build-up of arms to Africa from 1975 to 1977 and the pressure of Cuban troops. All that has happened in the Horn of Africa was part of this overall policy of attrition by threat. What is the purpose of this policy? In the Soviet design it is to impose an intolerable financial and pyschological burden upon the West; a burden which is calculated to cripple our economies, sap our resources, debilitate our morale and break our will to resist the ultimate threat&#x2014;the threat of annihilation, as was the hope with Afghanistan, as was the reality in Tibet and, as my noble friend Lady Airey of Abingdon has just observed, as may also be the reality in Afghanistan.<lb/>
Is this not why the Kremlin refuses to entertain any balanced or verifiable reduction in arms? It would defeat its own policy to do so. Those who, either at the behest of communist ideology or at the bidding of their own beliefs, proclaim the dogma of the so-called peace movement, accepting the risk of subjugation as preferable to resisting that ultimate threat, do an incalculable disservice to the cause of peace with freedom. In this they also put to the hazard the civilisations of those fledgling states of the third world.<lb/>
I quite understand that the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, would not have found my speech very interesting, but, with the greatest respect to him, he is not in his place. Is it not wholly wrong to approach fear of the Soviets as a psychosis? Having listened with great care, as I always do, to what he said, I can well understand why he should regard anyone who fears the Soviets as in need of psychological treatment. 1 shall be corrected if I am wrong, but I think no other noble Lord who has spoken in this debate has expressed any such view. Though I am grateful to the noble Lord for his homily on Marx and Lenin, I submit that there is a very real threat.<lb/>
The question is: if the threat is real, how is it to be resisted? That point was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Oram. In a new European diplomatic initiative the cost of the weapons burden to the Soviets is an important factor to be taken into account. In 1982 the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0067"/>
<col>117</col>
commission on disarmament under the chairmanship of Olaf Palme concluded that this burden,
<quote>"was straining even the wealthiest of economies, and threatening the stability of States irrespective of ideology or system of government".</quote>
The weapons burden by which this threat is implemented against the free world&#x2014;nuclear, non-nuclear, terrestrial, spatial, tactical, strategic; with land, sea and air forces&#x2014;can only be sustained by a repressive system of government designed to prevent their own people from demanding or obtaining a standard of living other than that which is imposed on them.<lb/>
But in this the Kremlin takes a great gamble. There is another counter on the tables of diplomacy, for in the second report, Brandt II, the commission recognised,
<quote>"poverty often provides the conditions in which rebel movements and territorial claims could flourish".</quote>
It urges, among other things, the transfer of resources from North to South and an increase in liquidity&#x2014;points taken in this debate by, in particular, the noble Lords, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos and Lord Gladwyn; and, as Lord Walston put it, the gross inequality of life. I liked those words as seeking to put in a phrase the quotation that I have taken from Brandt II.<lb/>
If in Central America, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, says, Europe has no role to play, nonetheless time is not on our side in which to pursue a diplomatic initiative on a European scale: to strengthen the resolve of the European institutions on defence and on aid to the third world. Co-ordination, as the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, has said, is perhaps one of the key words. But if this were to be done, if we were to co-ordinate, if we were to strengthen our resolve, time is not on the side of the Kremlin&#x2014;and the Kremlin knows it. Such, my Lords, is the message of hope.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00567">6 P.M.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00568"><member>Viscount Buckmaster</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to offer your Lordships some observations on communist influence in the Middle East and Africa, and in particular the former, two areas with which I have been associated for the last 35 years. Let me make it clear at the outset that I shall not be dealing with three very important areas which have been discussed so ably and extensively by previous speakers: trade, arms and defence. I need not remind your Lordships that Russian designs on the Middle East go back a long way further than the communist era. In fact, they go back to the time of Ivan the Terrible who captured Kazan from the Tartars in 1552. This policy, which was aimed of course principally at Persia, was continued during the time of the later Czars and particularly Peter the Great. In more modern times, the Russians (the Soviets as they were then) established a short-lived military presence in Gilan in Persia in 1921 and then in Azerbaijan in 1941&#2013;1946, and it was there that they established the Soviet-inspired republic of Mahabad which I shall deal with later.<lb/>
During the period of the 1920s and 1930s small communist parties sprang up in the Middle East. In fact, between 1922 and 1934 they were established in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, but they were small, their influence was very limited and, in some cases,
<col>118</col>
their leadership was non-Arab. For example, the Egyptian communist party was led by Jews. It was in the post-war period that the Soviets really began to gain momentum in their efforts to extend their influence in the Middle East, and they then became recognised widely as a super-power able to offer material and moral support to nationalist regimes struggling against what they called the oppressive West.<lb/>
Thus, we see continuous expansion in the 1950s, culminating with the very important tie-up between the communists and Qasim of Iraq in 1958, following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy. Now, as your Lordships are well aware, the communists are fairly well entrenched in Syria, in Libya and in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, where&#x2014;and this is an area that I want to examine later in more detail&#x2014;they had in fact established the only genuine communist-based regime in the Middle East. Communist parties are to be found all over the Middle East in varying sizes, with the sole exception of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States where Islam appears to present an almost inpenetrable barrier. Nevertheless, I must mention, as some of your Lordships may have read in the press, that there is speculation about possible Saudi recognition of the Soviet Union and the establishment of diplomatic relations; and I am told that the King himself is in favour of it.<lb/>
Let me deal now, very briefly, with Africa, an area on which I am not so well informed. However, I was engaged in a fascinating survey of communist activities in Africa in 1948. At that time, perhaps I could remind your Lordships, there were only four independent countries in the entire continent. They were, Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia and Liberia. During the period of the 1940s and 1950s the communists gradually gained ground in ways which are familiar to those of us who have studied this subject; that is to say, they would penetrate the embryonic trade unions, youth movements, opposition groups and so on. Now, as your Lordships are aware, they have powerful positions in several African states, but this has been dealt with by other speakers and I shall not deal with it now except to remind your Lordships that, so far as I know, no speaker has mentioned Benin, where there is also a communist presence.<lb/>
Let me now deal with what I regard as the most important matter to be discussed this evening: an assessment of Soviet strengths and weaknesses. First, I think I must examine the impact of Islam on communism. There are something like 600 million or more Moslems in the world, and most of these live in third world countries where the communists have established, in some cases, a toe-hold, in other cases a foothold, and indeed in South Yemen what one might call a bodyhold. How have they done this? I must emphasise at the outset that, although many young Moslems now disregard their faith and maintain that they are not practising Moslems, they are all basically believers; they all believe very strongly that the Koran is the word of God given to the Prophet Mohammed by the angel. Gabriel. They will therefore never criticise Islam in the same way as lapsed Christians will criticise Christianity.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0068"/>
<col>119</col>
The most important point to bear in mind is that, whereas Islam is tolerant towards Christians and Jews, it execrates atheists. For that reason&#x2014;and I have found this in many areas in which I have served&#x2014;there can never be any real meeting point between Islam and communism. Communist attempts to proselytise have failed miserably. It is true that in certain areas where the Moslems are fairly well entrenched one finds an admiration for the Soviets. But this is not in any sense an admiration, or even a partial admiration, for Soviet ideology. It is an admiration for the might of the Soviets whom many Moslems regard as a counter weight against the Americans.<lb/>
The area in which the communists have achieved their greatest success is in support of racial minorities. We have, for example, the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad (which I mentioned earlier) which was established by Qazi Mohammed. It only survived nine or ten months. Why did it fall? It fell because the Kurds soon realised that the Russians were attempting to develop their own interests rather than to advance the interests of the Kurdish nationalists. Similarly, we find that the Armenians, the Kurds in Iraq and other minorities have turned to communism, but have soon become disillusioned.<lb/>
The same thing happened, of course, with George Habash, one of the Palestinian leaders, who would claim to be a communist; but he has frequently indicated his dislike of Russia. Indeed, I think it is very important to mention that the communists have never succeeded in establishing a really powerful position in the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In the case of so many of these groups it has been a question of these minorities attaching their wagons to a star, provided they saw it bright enough and apparently leading in the right direction.<lb/>
Similarly, we have heads of state who have been disillusioned with the communists. Qasim, for example, after the important tie-up with the communists in 1958, soon lost interest in them in early 1959. Your Lordships will remember the expulsion of the Russian advisers by Sadat in 1972. In Libya now, I am told by a very important and entirely dependable friend who has recently visited Gaddafi, that he, too, is now getting very disillusioned with the communists.<lb/>
What about the area where they have established their most powerful hold&#x2014;the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen? I am sure that there is a lot of dissatisfaction with communists there. They have achieved a certain amount of success by reason of the order which they create, their attempts to diversify the economy, and so on. But Yemeni friends from North Yemen, where I served for four years, have told me several times&#x2014;and I am sure they were quite sincere in this&#x2014;that the South was much better off when it was Aden and under British occupation.<lb/>
So much for the communists' successes, albeit short-lived and of limited extent. Where have they failed? Here I should like to identify briefly four areas where I think they have fallen down very badly. First, they have failed entirely to impress upon the Arabs the need for a change in their way of life. The Arabs have a saying: "The dog's tail returns to shape even if you put it in a mould." They have tried to put the Arabs'
<col>120</col>
tails into a mould; they have gone back to shape. The only area where they have perhaps succeeded is in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and in Libya, in emancipating women. They have succeeded with the women perhaps rather more than with the men.<lb/>
The second area in which they have failed is in their attempt to take students, army officers and so on, to the Soviet Union for training. In almost all cases, those young men I have met in the Middle East and in Africa have come back disillusioned. Why, my Lords? It is because the communist r&#x00E9;gime does not make proper provision for them. They are often treated as inferior citizens; they are forced to learn a language which is difficult for them and they have to undergo the rigours of the Russian climate, quite apart, of course, from the Russian attempts at indoctrination, which have generally failed. Of course, one has to admit that one or two of these visitors have returned to form the nuclei of communist cells; and one should also mention that some of the army officers who have been to the Soviet Union have come back much impressed by Soviet military might.<lb/>
The third area is Soviet broadcasting. I have never met a single Arab&#x2014;and I have spoken to many all over the Arab world&#x2014;who has been impressed by Soviet broadcasts. Here we have a tremendously important role to play, which we are continuing to play effectively through the BBC Arabic Service and the BBC World Service. I am delighted to see, incidentally, that these two services are being maintained despite inevitable cuts in certain of the smaller vernacular services. It is really remarkable to find, even in the most remote villages, people turning on the radio. They are listening not even to Cairo, and certainly not to Moscow: they are listening to London.<lb/>
The fourth area I would put to your Lordships where the Soviets have failed is in their aid programme. We in the West have given agricultural, medical and other forms of aid which have proved far more effective, both in quantity and in quality, than anything which the Russians have to offer. The Russians, we know, have offered substantial military aid but they have not helped in any of the ways I have indicated; and their failure has been particularly marked in connection with national disasters. I am thinking particularly of the two earthquakes with which I was associated: one in Libya in 1963, which I missed by a few hours, and the second in North Yemen in December 1982. On neither occasion did the Russians produce any aid.<lb/>
What are the communists doing now in the Middle East? I would say they are basically playing a waiting game. They are keeping well in the wings over the Arab-Israeli dispute. It is very important to note that they are profiting by the discomfiture of the Americans; but we must bear in mind that they will take any opportunity that offers itself to make a great effort to establish themselves if, for example, there is a serious failure of American policy. I fully share the views which have been expressed by several of your Lordships that if we are to counter Soviet influence in the Middle East and in Africa, or wherever it may be, we can do so only by continuing to offer what we have offered so effectively in the past, even on a limited scale&#x2014;aid, increased broadcasts and so on. In my
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0069"/>
<col>121</col>
view, we shall not get anywhere by trying to undermine the Russians' position by a policy of mudslinging. It has been tried once or twice, but has almost always failed. My experience of the Arab world has been that we are still liked and still respected. We have an important role to play and we must play it. In so doing, we can perhaps go some way towards confounding the Soviet politics and frustrating their knavish tricks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00569">6.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00570"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are privileged to have had a speech from the noble Viscount, Lord Buckmaster, with his great knowledge of the Islamic world as a whole as well as the Middle East in particular, and indeed for the heartening remarks he made, which are encouraging. I should like to thank very much my noble friend Lord Cathcart for thinking of this debate and for introducing it so skilfully and comprehensively. I think we all owe him a debt. I will trust not to keep your Lordships too long because time is getting on, but there are one or two things I feel that I must say in view of what other people have said.<lb/>
There is no doubt&#x2014;I think most noble Lords, wherever they speak from, will agree&#x2014;that much Soviet effort is being spent on propaganda and on making efforts to subvert the free countries in the third world. I think perhaps there is a suggestion&#x2014;it certainly was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Walston, and to a certain extent perhaps from the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn&#x2014;that the basic problem of the Soviet threat is certainly there but there is an almost equal basic problem of massive inequality in third world countries which makes it easy from the Soviets to get in.<lb/>
It is a kind of chicken and egg problem that this throws up, and I suggest to your Lordships&#x2014;I think the noble Viscount, Lord Buckmaster, indicated this too&#x2014;that the Soviets have been on this game for a very long time. After all, they did try to subvert Europe in the 1940s and the 1950s. They go where they can; and I think that one can get distracted because if one concentrates on the appalling inequalities and shortages within the third world&#x2014;which indeed we must do from time to time&#x2014;one might fool oneself into thinking maybe that is more important than the Soviet threat and then get one's eye taken off the Soviet threat as the main ball which we have got to counter. I believe that until we counter that main ball in the longer term, nobody will be secure and nobody will feel absolutely sure that the third world, or any other parts of the world, will be properly succoured and fed. So one really must get the priorities right and I suggest very much that the Soviet subversion is a problem all of its own which needs to be tackled first.<lb/>
I was very struck by what I thought to be a very perceptive article about Andropov in the <i>Observer</i> last Sunday and, with your Lordships' permission, I will quote a little from it, because you really cannot accuse the <i>Observer</i> of being a Conservative paper in that sense. It reads:
<quote>"The Resagans and the Thatchers and the Foots etc. are, and have to be, responsible to ordinary men and women of goodwill who want to make the world a better place &#x00B7; Mr. Andropov is not responsible in this manner. He is in the deepest sense irresponsible".</quote>
<col>122</col>
I go on with another quote:
<quote>"The Soviet leadership does not accept and has never accepted (since Lenin) the principle of 'live and let live'."</quote>
The article went on to say that Andropov cannot change things, because
<quote>"The Kremlin is the prisoner of its own lies",</quote>
and its own bureaucracy ensures that it remains so. We also need to remember that belief in God is scorned by the communist creed and religion is as tightly controlled as is practicable within the Soviet empire. False propaganda is thus seen as legitimate in a way that ordinary western peoples cannot understand, and therefore they do not expose them as fully as they should. I really think that this is a great danger.<lb/>
We have had mention from the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, and my noble friend Lord Cathcart of various countries where subversion has taken place. I, too, have studied those countries and I noted&#x2014;I shall not go into detail, because I do not want to keep your Lordships too long&#x2014;that there are 12 what I call firmly subordinate countries, starting with Cuba and including Ethiopia and South Vietnam. There are four that have been dragged towards full subservience&#x2014;countries such as Nicaragua and Grenada&#x2014;which were mentioned, in particular, by the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont.<lb/>
However, in a way I find that the most interesting countries are those which are additional to the ones I have mentioned and which accept Soviet Military advisers. There are 18 of those and there are some surprising ones&#x2014;at least, they were surprising to me until I heard other noble Lords&#x2014;such as Peru, Nigeria and Madagascar. It is sad that so many of those countries have allowed themselves to become linked to a power which is not only "the prisoner of its own lies", as I said earlier, but is one of the very few countries which, with its closest satellites, has signed the human rights conventions but practises detention without trial.<lb/>
I also find it ominous that several of the countries can readily provide overseas base facilities, as has been mentioned by other noble Lords. Perhaps <i>Pay Britannica,</i> which the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, mentioned, was not too had a thing while it lasted. It is sad, indeed, that it cannot be re-created; it at least ensured the peace.<lb/>
So, my Lords, what is to be done? I asked myself this question before I heard the noble Lord, Lord Oram, saying that most noble Lords here are weak in saying what to do. I, too, agree with my noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing, and indeed with the noble Lord, Lord Oram, himself, that selective and careful aid, medical aid, food aid and so on, where relevant, should certainly he provided to the third world. Indeed, I think that we do provide it and are continually tackling this problem. Maybe we do not do enough, and perhaps we do not do enough because we do not have enough resources, but the more we can spend on this aspect the better.<lb/>
The other thing that we can and must do is to increase the exposure of the tyranny of the Soviet system and the lying nature of much of its propaganda. We have the inestimable advantage of a free press, but it is sad when a free press itself seems to be subverted, or at least to have closed eyes that cannot see the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0070"/>
<col>123</col>
desperate, lying failings of the Soviet system. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, who mentioned the BBC programmes and articles in <i>The Times,</i> and it is a tragedy that our free press men are not aware of how they can be led astray by false ideas about priorities, and by not understanding the essential falsehoods of the other side. We should also do the most we can to expose the bogus claims of the Soviets when they make them in the third world. I hope that we shall keep on battling and that we shall topple these people one day&#x2014;not by aggressive fighting and action of that sort, but by the essential truth of our cause and by exposing the lies of theirs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00571"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I ask him a question? Does he not think that this constant talk of a Soviet threat is a very subtle form of flattery? That is what it comes to. What do we mean by that? Of course the poorer countries, the countries which are worse off, will turn to anybody who is ready to help them and might turn to take up some of their ideas. It seems to me that we are going about things in a very odd way by this great attack and this great emphasis on the Soviet threat. They are not threatening us. They are not threatening Britain. They are not threatening us with going to war&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00572"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thought that the noble Baroness was asking me a question, but she went on to make a speech. If I may turn it into a question, the answer is that so long as the Soviets take the very false line that they do, and have done for 50 years or more, it is extremely important to get them in the right proportion. I quite see what the noble Baroness is saying and my answer to her is: yes, certainly, we should do what we can to help&#x2014;I said that earlier&#x2014;but, for heaven's sake, do not let us blind ourselves to the falsehoods of the Soviets. We must not blind ourselves.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00574"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened, as always, with great attention to the noble Lord who has just spoken; but he formulated one proposition in a way with which I disagreed. He said that we had to tackle the Soviet subversion first before we tackle the terrible social conditions in these third world countries. I shall come to the whole topic as I proceed, but I do not think that it is a question of tackling one before the other. I think that they must both be tackled simultaneously.<lb/>
I come to the Motion so well moved by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. I feel about the noble Earl's Motion as I felt about the Motion moved not so long ago by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, which called upon us to support the Atlantic Pact. I agree with the statement made by the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart; but in itself it is a very incomplete statement of the whole issue. That is no criticism of the noble Earl. It is up to us to round off the picture. My own leader, the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, and the noble Lord, Lord Oram (who have left us for the moment), emphasised the appalling social conditions and in many cases the political tyranny which exist in these underdeveloped countries. They have called on the Government to do
<col>124</col>
what they can to improve matters. Obviously we wish to take such steps, but this evening I am going to confine myself primarily to the Motion, which calls attention to the Soviet menace. I am sorry that my dear old friend, Lady Gaitskell, does not believe in the Soviet threat.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00580"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Baroness, but if she cannot contain herself I shall give way at any moment. My Lords, to resume what was to have been the thread of my discourse, I agree with all that has been said on these Benches about the social conditions. I agree also with what has been said about Soviet subversion. I am bound to point out to noble Lords opposite that in a debate on overseas aid which we had only last week (I am not sure which noble Lords opposite took part) it was pointed out repeatedly from this side that since they have been in power the Conservative Government have cut overseas aid by 19 per cent. and have done a great deal of damage so far as grants to overseas students are concerned. If therefore we are to discuss how we can deal with these problems we have to give this Government a very bad mark on that side of the ledger.<lb/>
Turning to the Soviet threat itself, I shall not attempt to add anything to what has been said on that subject. The noble Earl speaks with a great deal of military authority. Other speakers, like the noble Lords, Lord Orr-Ewing and Lord Chalfont, placed before us a number of very unpalatable and, I am bound to say, very depressing facts. Do we mind about this? Here I come into collision, perhaps, with the noble Baroness, though not with her late husband, always to be revered, who was a supreme champion of the Atlantic Pact. This is a matter of record. Everybody is well aware that the Atlantic Pact exists only because of the Soviet threat. We are spending thousands of millions of pounds a year not because we are being threatened by El Salvador or America but because we are being threatened by the Soviets.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00581"><member>The Earl of Cathcart</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in an attempt to protect the noble Earl from the noble Baroness, my Motion is not to take note of the Soviet threat but to take note of the increasing Soviet influence, which is a very different thing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00582"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: I am trying to put this matter in perspective and to consider its implications. If this were purely an academic discussion we might discuss the French influence or the Belgian influence. We
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0071"/>
<col>125</col>
could discuss many influences. However, we are discussing this influence in a spirit of considerable and well-justified gloom, because of what it implies. All those who have served in any Government, Labour or Conservative, since the war believe that the Soviets constitute a threat, so if their influence spreads the threat is greater. I join my colleagues in everything they have said about social conditions. Also I join in belabouring noble Lords opposite for their failure to do very much about overseas aid.<lb/>
I come now to the question of what can be done. Let us suppose that the Soviet influence is not benign or even neutral but is to be regarded as a threat to the survival of the free world. I am not going to attempt to embark upon a military discussion. We must leave that for a defence debate. Nor will I cover much of the ground which was covered so well in the debate initiated last week by the noble Lord, Lord Oram. When we were in power, we on this side took a very different view of overseas aid from that which has been taken by noble Lords opposite. Last week I dealt with the moral aspect. Everybody dealt with it, more or less, but I concentrated on the duty of the rich powers to make sacrifices on behalf of the poor. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, gave us a good lead in that direction. That was what I said last week and I shall not repeat those arguments today.<lb/>
I am trying to ask a practical question: what do we do if there is this increasing Soviet influence and, as I must call it for the last time, a Soviet threat? Various points were mentioned, apart from aid and the attempt to improve social conditions. The problem of overseas students was mentioned. I looked up the report of the debate which we had a little while ago on the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Boyd of Merton. I was one of his oldest friends. I knew him well at Oxford and while we were there I wrote an article about him called <i>Isis Idol.</i> Therefore I pay my heartfelt tribute to his life of service. The noble Lord raised the issue of overseas students in the debate. Some improvement was announced by the Government. When I looked at the report of the debate I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Caradon, pointed out from these Benches that, even under the improved arrangements announced by the Government, the amount that this Government will be paying towards overseas students will be no more than 15 per cent. of what the last Government were paying. On that count also therefore they fall down very badly.<lb/>
However, I am not going to deal with that point now. I tried to find something which is unlikely to be said by every other speaker. Therefore I did a little homework about the British Council. Most of us know about the work of the British Council and have admired it for a long time. I found a passage in the introduction by the chairman, Sir Charles Troughton, which sums up so well my own approach to these problems that I venture to quote it. Sir Charles writes:
<quote>'The council"&#x2014;</quote>
he refers there to the British Council, of which he is chairman&#x2014;
<quote>"builds bridges of understanding and appreciation between the people of Britain and other nations. It does this"&#x2014;</quote>
this is the passage I want to emphasise&#x2014;
<col>126</col>
<quote>"in Britain's own interests. But because our country has so much to offer the rest of the world in such fields as education and training, the sciences and technology, the arts and the English language, and because the council's style is both practical and of manifest goodwill, its activities are welcomed all over the globe.".</quote>
As the chairman, Sir Charles Troughton, sees the work of the British Council, it is attempting to promote a better understanding of Britain. It is also doing something of the utmost value for the peoples whom it is trying to help, whether overseas or when they are brought here as students. When I have spoken to one or two who have served for many years abroad on behalf of the council I have not found that they consciously divide in their own minds the role of serving Britain and the role of serving the peoples whose countries they visit. However, I believe that they are happy in their own minds that there is no clash between those purposes. In fact, I am sure that the two purposes are well harmonised.<lb/>

We have to think of ways in addition to military assistance which will be provided for, we hope, by NATO and the allies generally. To use the phrase employed by my noble friend Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos and one or two other noble Lords, we have to find ways with our hearts and minds. The British may do this on a comparatively small scale, although I wish that it could be on a larger scale. But at least they are doing the kind of work that is necessary; the kind of work that in the end produces friendship. In that sense, it is a patriotic British value, but it has a deeper spiritual meaning because it is conceived and carried out in the interests of the people themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00585">6.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00586"><member>The Earl of Cork and Orrery</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with fascination, as always, to the speech, or whatever it was, of the noble Earl, Lord Longford. I am so overwhelmed by such a display of fireworks and virtuosity that I believe it would be a mistake to try to follow him in any detail. Instead, I will begin with a quotation from the same gentleman who has been mentioned once or twice by other noble Lords, and particularly by my noble friend Lord Cathcart. The quotation I would offer is:
<quote>"It is always to be recalled that the Russians are masters at the game of chess and they treat the whole world as a hoard whereon Africa is only one segment".</quote>
Some noble Lords may recognise that from a paper that Mr. Louis Fitzgibbon wrote not very long ago. It continues thus:
<quote>"Nonetheless, their strategy is all embracing and they take advantage of the Western error of seeing continents, not as a whole, but as individual trouble spots. Only by also seeing the problem in its entirety can the West hope to combat Soviet influence."</quote>
Seeing problems in their entirety is, I agree, precisely what we usually fail to do. But why does the strife between the East and the West, between Russia and ourselves, exist at all? We know that it stems from the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, resulting in the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0072"/>
<col>127</col>
communist ideology of the state which succeeded to the Russia of the Czars.<lb/>
What is so fundamentally wrong in this creed from the point of view of the democratic West? The fact is that the Russian point of view is based on a misconception that is so utterly unacceptable to us that we cannot possibly come to terms with it at all. We can learn to live beside it&#x2014;we must in fact&#x2014;but to live with it, no. The action of the communist state which has split it so completely from the rest of the world is the denial of the significance of the individual human person. This it has to do because in communism the state is the supreme and only authority in the lives of the people. This means that there is no appeal against its decisions; no outside authority or yardstick against which its decisions can be measured and judged.<lb/>
This is not the normal condition of man. Man in his normal condition must believe in some kind of god or gods and is thus equipped with the kind of yardstick that the communist system cannot tolerate. I will quote now the words of the great psychologist Carl Gustav Jung:
<quote>"It is not ethical principles, however lofty, or creeds, however orthodox, that lay the foundations for the freedom and autonomy of the individual, but simply and solely the empirical awareness, the incontrovertible experience of an intensely personal, reciprocal relationship between man and an extramundane authority which acts as a counterpoise to the 'world' and its 'reason' ".</quote>
It is precisely this idea of an "extramundane authority" that is intolerable to an authoritarian state. Thus we have Karl Marx's celebrated dictum about religion being
<quote>"the opium of the people".</quote>
What he did not mention, and indeed perhaps did not even know, is that religion is not, like opium, an acquired addiction in man, but is a congenital fact. So much so that if none of the better accredited religions is known to him, Man will invent one of his own and become a sun worshipper or an animist.<lb/>
This being so, it follows that when Soviet leaders say there shall be no more religion, they are demanding the impossible. What happens is simply that the old religion abolished by ukase is replaced by another. That is what has happened in Russia, and the new religion that has replaced the old is the religion of the state. Not that the old religion is dead, but that is another matter. To quote Jung again,
<quote>"The state has taken the place of God; that is why, as seen from this angle, socialist dictatorships are religions and state slavery is a form of worship".</quote>
If the noble Lord cares to read what I have said in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, he might do well to read it alongside the quotation given by my noble friend Lord Mottistone from the article in The <i>Observer.</i><lb/>
The result of this is that on matters of ethical principle one cannot argue with the Soviets. Nor can we hope to influence them by example. Our whole morality is based on whatever extramundane or supramundane authority we think it is that imparts significance to the individual, whereas theirs is dictated inexorably by the state system to which they themselves are slaves. For them, one course of action is not worse or better than another; it is simply more or less expedient for the state. I quote once more from Jung:
<col>128</col>
<quote>"The West has unfortunately not yet awakened to the fact that our appeal to idealism, reason and other desirable virtues, delivered with so much enthusiasm, is mere sound and fury. It is a puff of wind swept away in the storm of religious faith, however twisted that faith may appear to us".</quote>
Those quotations, incidentally, were from Jung's book <i>The Undiscovered Self,</i> first published in 1957.<lb/>
I will now drop the word "religion", hoping that I have made the point that from beyond the Iron Curtain we are faced by a faith as strong as our own and a good deal more fanatically pursued. It is as useless for us to argue with a communist as it is for him to argue with us about democracy. Furthermore, we may as well acknowledge that if they look twisted to us, we look equally twisted to them; I suppose that a skewer looks twisted to a corkscrew.<lb/>
But to the third world countries we can deploy our arguments, and what do they hear? What do they think when they hear, for example, President Reagan describe the USSR as "The sinful empire" or "The focus of evil in the modern world", seeming to imply that the West is the exclusive home of the righteous and the good? If the president is talking to those third worlders I dare say he would like them to think of such names as Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Hungary, Poland and Afghanistan. But suppose, instead, they were reminded of El Salvador, Nicaragua or Vietnam. There are (let us face it) some who think that the world would be a happier place without the Central Intelligence Agency&#x2014;that weird body which seems, like Satan in the first chapter of Job, to spend its time
<quote>"going to and fro in the earth and &#x00B7; walking up and down in it".</quote>
very often with a lighted cigarette between its fingers looking for bits of blue touch-paper to ignite.<lb/>
I hope that no one thinks that it is wrong to be rude to the Americans as long as one is trying to be just. They are our friends and allies on whom our very existence may again depend at some time in the future. It is to them, above all people, that we should be able, and must be able, to speak freely. To them we can be outspoken without malice in the belief that they will listen and in the hope that some among them may detect a grain of truth in what we say. That is a far more profitable exercise than being rude with malice to the Russians, who will neither listen nor heed.<lb/>
In initiating this debate my noble friend Lord Cathcart has done a valuable public service by compelling us to look squarely at what I believe is the most menacing problem of our time. Europe, I believe, is safe despite the attentions of the unilateralists. On the NATO front Russia is held and will continue to be held, but we in turn are held by them while the Red flood seeps slowly round the flanks. Russia is almost ready in the Middle East and in the Horn of Africa to take over the oilfields when her own oilfields run dry. In the rest of Africa, by proxy, and also in Central and South America, the dominoes lean ever more shakily one against another. The third world is a world of dominoes, but at least dominoes form a set. One must play with them all at once. One cannot have much of a game with only the sixes or only the threes and fives. It is the same with chess: one cannot win by keeping a reserve of a few pieces in the box. Total commitment from the beginning is the only way of winning the game. The battle for the third world is a battle, as has already been
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0073"/>
<col>129</col>
said, for hearts and minds, and it is for the whole of that world, not for just one or two pieces while the others stay in the box.<lb/>
The one thing which I should have thought (erroneously as it turns out) would by now be abundantly clear, especially to the Americans, is that it is not a battle that can be won by force of arms. Anyone who doubts that may reflect on the recent history of Indo-China and wonder fearfully whether Vietnam may possibly be reappearing in Central America, which I for one do not believe.<lb/>
The Motion speaks of "penetration and influence". These are two distinct and separate things. If we are to stop the penetration it is by means of influence that we must do it, and not by force of arms. It must be concerted influence. Not only is it a deadly error to regard continents as isolated collections of more or less unrelated trouble spots; it is equally dangerous for our nations to regard these as more or less unrelated formations on the battlefield.<lb/>
This is the point where I ought to meet the just criticism of the noble Lord, Lord Oram, and have something constructive to say, as others have. I suppose I have very little except to say that certainly the EEC has a part to play, and that is something we forget at our peril. We fret and whine over such things as cruise missiles and dual keys, but these things, viewed against the denial of all human rights that is creeping into and through the third world like some spillage of crude oil on the surface of the cold and wholesome sea, are, in the words of the Earl of Clincham, "as piffle before the wind".<lb/>
I do not think we have that much time left. If freedom is to survive in those countries that have and cherish it, we must draw the third world countries into our comity. Let us listen to the warning voice of Solzhenitsyn in recognising that this is the great question of our time. But how do we start? Where is the foundation on which to build? Obviously, it is not in the United Nations. Perhaps it is in the Atlantic Assembly. The noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, had some interesting remarks about the possibilities here in the way of aid and education, and in other ways, although some noble Lords may feel that there were parts of his speech that the others cannot reach.<lb/>
I pray that when this debate is done we may learn from the Minister, in his reply, that our own Government are showing the first faint glimmering, at least, of awareness of the peril that besets us, and of the magnitude and urgency of the task from which, if we are not to go whining into the dark, we must not shrink.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00587">6.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00588"><member>Lord Thomas of Swynnerton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like other noble Lords, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for introducing this important and interesting debate. Governments derive their legitimacy from various sources: consent, divine right, brutality or despotism. In the case of the Soviet Union such legitimacy as they have derives from the theory of Marxism&#x2014;Leninism. The view of Marxist&#x2014;Leninists is that that creed is destined to spread to the ends of the earth and that it is the duty of good Marxist&#x2014;Leninists to accelerate that
<col>130</col>
process. If the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, thinks that that is a psychotic remark, I dispute it. It is purely the remark which derives from a study of what Soviet leaders say themselves. It is not psychotic it is simply literate.<lb/>
The Soviet Union, since 1917, has pursued its aims of extending its influence by various ways; sometimes by subversion, sometimes by the astute use of foreign communist parties, sometimes by the use of front organisations, and sometimes&#x2014;and here I dispute the remarks of my noble friend Lord Cork and Orrery&#x2014;by the use of or threat of force. He instanced the case of Vietnam as an occasion when force did not work. Many of us would think that it was the use of force by North Vietnam which gained that country an overwhelming military victory. Other occasions will occur to us which suggest that the threat or use of force in modern circumstances can still be a very effective instrument of action by a state against states which are not prepared to arrange for their own defences.<lb/>
All the time since 1917 the Soviet Union has been prepared to use international supports to carry on its activities. Even in the Russian civil war the Soviet Government of the time organised Austro-Hungarian prisoners-of-war into an international Red Army. In the Spanish civil war there was an international brigade which acted as a focus for international volunteers but which was effectively managed by communists or by Soviet citizens.<lb/>
In the past 10 years or so we have seen the use of another instrument for the extension of Soviet influence; namely, the use of surrogate states. We have had the activities of these states well chronicled by several of those noble Lords who have spoken: South Yemen, Libya, Vietnam, and of course Cuba. Although a lot has been said about Cuba during the course of this debate&#x2014;not least by my noble friend, Lord Chalfont, in a most eloquent speech&#x2014;I think that, since I have studied the history of Cuba, it would be appropriate for me to say a few words about that country.<lb/>
Cuba is especially useful to the Soviet Union for a number of reasons. First, the population is about a half to a third black or mulatto, and therefore can be expected to identify itself with the cause of others of those races. The charm of most Cubans is something which enables Cubans&#x2014;even revolutionary Cubans&#x2014;to get away, it might be said, with murder. A certain romance still attaches, surprisingly enough, to the Cuban communist cause because of the apparent achievement of Castro in the late 1950s in overthrowing a r&#x00E9;gime, apparently well-established and well supported by the United States, with a handful of men. The style of Castro's anti-Americanism has a certain resonance among people who should know better, even in Western Europe, and who would find it very disagreeable themselves to be living under a regime sponsored by Castro. Nevertheless, they find themselves able to give Cuba the benefit of the doubt.<lb/>
The Cubans, it must also be remembered, come from a country which was relatively well developed and relatively technologically aware before Castro got into power, as is natural, bearing in mind that Cuba has produced not only the world's best cigars for nearly 200 years but has also been a major supplier of sugar
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0074"/>
<col>131</col>
for a very long time. And there is the emphasis on war which the Cuban revolution has from the beginning given in its culture, ideology and propaganda: three things which are often in the modern world muddled together&#x2014;quite effectively, it must be said. There was an occasion, for example, in 1961, just after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, when Castro said that he was certainly not going to give every Cuban a vote; he was instead going to give every one of them a rifle, a threat which he has certainly carried out since that time.<lb/>
The strategic importance of Cuba in the Caribbean has been mentioned by several noble Lords. It is a fact that has been recognised by British, as well as American, military experts and soldiers for at least 200 years&#x2014;indeed since Lord Cathcart's ancestor, the eighth Lord Cathcart, carried out an expedition against Cuba in 1740.<lb/>
What must be puzzling for the world and for your Lordships is why Cuba should have accepted this impulsion towards world revolution under Castro's and Soviet direction. Could it perhaps be because the regime is itself a very popular one within Cuba? Considering that something like 10 per cent. of the population fled in the first two or three years, that would seem to be an unwarrantable assumption. It has also to be remembered that, when for a second or so last year the Peruvian embassy in Havana was opened to those who thought that they might wish to fly or get away (despite the fact that the frontiers had been closed for some years) no less than 10,000 people fled into the extremely overcrowded courtyard of that embassy within the course of a single night. That would rather suggest that popularity is not the main thing which characterises the Cuban r&#x00E9;gime.<lb/>
Indeed, there have been instances of heroism in flight from Cuba which compare with those marvellous flights carried out by people getting away from East Germany. I remember, for example the Cuban who escaped to Spain by tying himself up inside the wheel undercarriage of an Iberian aeroplane and hung on all the way across the Atlantic. That is an instance of persistence which would surely question those who say that the Caribbean or Latin American people are full of frivolity and incapable of carrying through policy.<lb/>
Your Lordships may be thinking that the political life of Cuba has changed, so that at least there is some degree of participation within the r&#x00E9;gime. A recent political prisoner, Armando Valladares&#x2014;whose plight I had occasion to draw to your Lordships' attention some months ago after he had been in prison for 22 years&#x2014;mentioned, when he appeared before a Senate sub-committee not long ago, that indeed there is a lively political life in Cuba but it is a life carried out almost entirely within prisons. There political controversy can indeed be carried on.<lb/>
To turn to economic success, I am afraid to say that during the 24 years since Castro got into power Cuba has fallen from the top of the Latin American economic league to somewhere near the bottom. Sugar is also, if anything, more of a dominant crop than it was in the days of Batista. Some of your Lordships will be thinking that schools and health have changed for the better in Cuba, but the question must occur to all
<col>132</col>
of us: what is the point of being educated if all you learn is Marxism and Leninism? In a democratic assembly, it must also occur to us that there is little point in being saved by the doctor if the air that you breathe is the air of despotism. So I cannot really believe that these are reasons why the Cubans put up with this r&#x00E9;gime.<lb/>
The fact is that Cuba was turned into a communist regime by the will of a determined leader&#x2014;of great qualities, it must be said&#x2014;determined to ruin the United States wherever he possibly could and motivated by deep hatred of Anglo-Saxon culture. The small Cuban communist party before the revolution played a part after Castro had got into power in order to maintain the communist management of the regime; but it played, as a matter of fact, a very little part in achieving the r&#x00E9;gime.<lb/>
I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Walston, argued that the United States had pushed Castro and Cuba into communism. My researches suggest that that is not the case. Indeed, they would suggest that a conscious act of will was taken by Castro, who was not at that time a communist, to establish a communist regime in the country. He was able to play on an anti-American nationalism (very similar. I suppose, to the anti-British nationalism which characterised Egypt in the 1950s), although afterwards those who expressed themselves so strongly in favour of Cuban nationalism found that they had exchanged the control of their economy by the United States for an even tougher control by the Soviet Union.<lb/>
There is one other point which should be mentioned in relation to Cuba's role in the world. I mentioned the fact that it did play a part for many years as a great sugar exporter and a great exporter of tobacco. As many of your Lordships will be aware, it also made great contributions in the world of the dance. However, there is another contribution for which it was well known in the years before Castro came into power, namely, its contribution to Caribbean gangsterism. One cannot help feeling that under the Castro r&#x00E9;gime there has been, as it were, a kind of politicisation of a gangsterism already latent in the national culture.<lb/>
While I have been speaking, no doubt some of your Lordships will have been asking yourselves one or two questions: for example, whether Cuba is entirely, even now, a Soviet satellite. I suggest that there are indications that some capacity for initiative does still exist in the Cuban system. It is conceivable, for example, that ideas of the Cuban penetration into Africa, to which much attention has been paid, actually derive from a suggestion by Castro himself. It is also possible that the activities in Central America and the Caribbean derive from a long-standing desire on the part of the present Cuban Government to achieve a row of sub-satellites which might be of assistance to them should the Soviet Union ever decide, in the nature of things&#x2014;which happens in international politics in the Soviet Union&#x2014;to get rid of their own very useful satellites, such as they have been up to the moment. There are some ways too in which Cuba is a different kind of communist r&#x00E9;gime from some of the others.<lb/>
In conclusion, I refer to a final question which has run as a current throughout the debate: to what extent
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0075"/>
<col>133</col>
has the United States exaggerated, overdone, the Cuban or the Soviet threat in Central America? I believe that this is a very serious question, and we ought all to pay a good deal of attention to it. The noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, pointed out the strategic significance of the extension of Cuban influence in Central America. He might perhaps have added the importance of oil in Central America; it, too, is a factor. It might also be more appropriate to note that, if by any chance the whole of Central America were to go wrong, and be captured by a Cuban-style r&#x00E9;gime, the main consequence would be the enormous number of refugees who would seek entry into the United States. No doubt there would be Western European Governments, who might have taken up strong attitudes before such a collapse, who would be rather unlikely to take a very large number of refugees, should it come to that.<lb/>
I believe that all the evidence is that the leaders of the guerrilla movements in El Salvador, like the leaders of the r&#x00E9;gime in Nicaragua, were trained in Cuba, and that the armaments primarily come from outside the region and, as the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, has pointed out, primarly from Cuba and the Soviet Union. Even moe important, is that there is no evidence whatever that the peoples of those countries would prefer to have a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist r&#x00E9;gime. Indeed, the evidence available is that they would infinitely prefer to have a democratic pluralist r&#x00E9;gime, such as is enjoyed by the peoples of Costa Rica and Honduras, and indeed is enjoyed by all the larger countries in the region; namely, Venezuela, Colombia, and, after a fashion, even Mexico.<lb/>
There was, as your Lordships will be aware, something which looked to the outside world very much like a fair general election in El Salvador last year. The report on that seemed a convincing description of how a general election should be carried out. Therefore, I believe that in its activities in support of democratic experiments in Central America, the United States should be given all the encouragement that we can summon up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00589"><member>The Marquess of Ailsa</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must confess that I welome this debate. As a result of my journeys and my contacts with the various countries which form part of the Horn of Africa, and the neighbouring countries and oceans, I am very concerned about the extent of Soviet penetration in that area. On previous occasions I have drawn your Lordships' attention to the Pact of Aden, which was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Cathcart. This is a Soviet-inspired alliance between Ethiopia, South Yemen, and Libya&#x2014;an alliance in which the signatories bind themselves, among many other things, to promote the common revolutionary struggles, and to support both African and Arab liberation movements.<lb/>
In consequence of that pact, in July 1982 Ethiopia invaded Somalia, supposedly in support of some Somali dissidents who were seeking to overthrow the Government of President Siad Barre. This invasion took place under the aegis of the Pact of Aden. Much of the funding and supplies for the dissidents, such as they were, came from Libya. From South Yemen
<col>134</col>
came artillerymen and other military technicians. The Soviet Union very quickly&#x2014;the first day&#x2014;gave its public backing and full support to the invasion. I understand that even to this day Ethiopian troops are on Somali territory. In fact, this morning I was told that if I went back to trenches that I visited in September last year, I would find that nothing had changed; they are still there.<lb/>
It is true, as has already been said, that Ethiopia, South Yemen, and Libya make no secret of their adherence to Soviet doctrine. Ethiopia is proud of its endeavours to be a truly Marxist-Leninist state. South Yemen is similar. Libya is slightly different, since Colonel Gaddafi is really a law unto himself, provided that he has the support of the Soviet Union.<lb/>
All three of these countries derive a vast amount of aid, both military and otherwise, from the Soviet Union and her satellites&#x2014;East Germany, North Korea and Cuba. There are Russian military bases in South Yemen. There are also Russian bases in Ethiopia. In South Yemen the Cubans and the East Germans have camps for the purpose of training guerrillas and other persons in the art of subversion. If, as I have done, you ask members of these countries what is the purpose of all this, they state that they wish to resist imperialism and to pursue the paths of peace. When asked who is the imperialist they state, the Americans and anyone who in any way is allied to, or assists, them. They define peace as being a struggle for a victory for socialism throughout the world; and by socialism they mean Marxist-Leninism. That is the only form of socialism that is acceptable to them.<lb/>
Before concluding my reference to this area, I should draw your Lordships' attention to the attempt earlier this year by Colonel Gaddafi to overthrow the Government of President Nimeri in Sudan. Sometimes the attempt appeared to be a kind of off-the-cuff event. I fear that it was not. It was very well organised, and it was very fortunate that the Government of the Sudan was able to stop it before it took place. Had the attempt succeeded, it would have helped our Soviet friends no end to spread their influence further into parts of Africa&#x2014;and parts of Africa which, having sampled the Soviet influence, wish to have no more of it.<lb/>
The same applies to Somalia. One has to bear in mind that it was the Somalis, under President Siad Barre, who first invited the Soviets into the Horn of Africa. However, they quickly decided that enough was enough, and said, if I may be excused a Scottish expression, "Get'oot". The Soviets were put out but, unfortunately, went to Ethiopia.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00590"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Marquess agree&#x2014;in case there is any misapprehension in people's minds that the Soviet Union might equally leave Ethiopia, as it left Somalia&#x2014;that there would be no question of the Soviets agreeing meekly to do so because of the importance of its naval base off the coast of Eritrea? If Colonel Mengistu was inclined to throw out the Soviets, the Soviets would be able rapidly to replace him with someone else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00591"><member>The Marquess of Ailsa</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that intervention. I agree with every word. I had intended to come to this matter by a different

<col>135</col>
route. It is true that the Russians have bases in Ethiopia. It is not in their interest to get out. If they did, they have better places to which to go. This is the problem that we face.<lb/>
I wish to move now to the Indian Ocean and what I would term the island states of Madagascar, Mauritius and now the Seychelles. In each of these countries there is now a socialist Government which is, in some form or other, under the influence of the Soviet Union. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, mentioned the Port Louis pact. I do not know about that, but I do know about the zone of peace. The three countries have united to create in the area of the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. But it is peace as described by Lenin, not peace as we understand it. The object of this peace, clearly and openly stated, is to remove the American rapid deployment force from Diego Garcia.<lb/>
At the same time, while demanding peace, the Governments of these islands offer the facilities that they possess to the Soviet navy and the Soviet air force. I understand that even at the present moment there are regular Russian-manned MiG squadrons based in Madagascar. There are certainly refuelling facilities for long-range bombers; and the Soviet fleet makes use of the various naval ports in that island. I do not know about aircraft movements in the Seychelles, but the Soviet fleet certainly makes use of facilities that are available there.<lb/>
In passing, I should like to comment that only in Mauritius has the socialist Government arrived through the ballot box. In Madagascar and the Seychelles the socialist Governments arrived at the point of a gun and, so far as I can learn, are maintained at the point of a gun. In Madagascar, the more important posts and higher offices within the Government&#x2014;I am not talking about the president, but of the people who do the work&#x2014;are held by North Koreans, East Germans and others. I heard the other day that the chief of the intelligence service in Madagascar is a North Korean. If the Soviet Union has not penetrated there, it certainly has a strong influence.<lb/>
I also heard the other day, in talking about Madagascar, of the persecution of religion. I have referred to this issue before in your Lordships' House in connection with Ethiopia. I gather that the same r&#x00E9;gime is now operating in Madagascar to discredit and destroy religion. That tends to go with Soviet doctrine.<lb/>
We have talked of the Soviet penetration that has taken place and the influence that possibly exists in that region. I cannot help raising the question: what are we going to do about it? It is no good sitting here talking about it. We must try and find some way of combating it. I feel that we in this country, other countries of Europe and the United States have not tried hard enough to win the hearts and minds of people, especially in those countries that are currently free and wish to remain free. We have somehow to get across the message that we understand the problems that face them. Some of those problems are possibly of their own making; some are induced by the intense recession felt throughout the world. That should not stop us saying, "We believe in you". We should try to
<col>136</col>
see them, not from our position standing here but as they see themselves. We should try and understand their view of events. We should explain that we understand their problems, that we are behind them, and that we will try to help them to keep their countries free, not according to the Marxist-Leninist definition but according to our definition, in which people are free to live their lives and to get on with their business as they desire.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00593"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in joining the expressions of thanks to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for initiating the debate, and having had the advantage of hearing it, may I say that I have been able to see the vast range of knowledge, information and opinion that can be brought to bear by your Lordships on this important issue. If I am at all disappointed, it is that there has perhaps been more concentration on the periphery and on the areas in which the influence of the Soviet Union is exercised than on the Soviet Union and its policies. It is no good expecting to discover what we can do to deal with these threats without an understanding of what the Soviet Union is about. This point was made, before he embarked upon a fascinating disquisition on Cuba, by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas.<lb/>
It is important that we should try to get inside and understand the way in which Soviet policy appears to Soviet policy-makers. It is not desirable&#x2014;this is one of the weaknesses perhaps of the American response at the moment&#x2014;to chastise the Soviet Union, to refer to it as the fount of all evil and to point to the many crimes that its leaders have undoubtedly perpetrated. It is more important to come to an understanding. Equally, that understanding must not be blinded by sentimentality. We must not take what we should like to be the case for what is the case.<lb/>
I can illustrate this latter point by a remark of the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, who said that he would like to see the Soviet Union and the West collaborating for the benefit of the peoples of the third world. If two institutions, two countries or two individuals are to collaborate, they must share the same goal. No evidence has been presented to us in this debate and nor is there any evidence in any of the practices of the Soviet Union to show&#x2014;and the noble Viscount, Lord Buck master, referred to its failure even to assist on occasions of national disaster&#x2014;that the Soviet Union puts the welfare of peoples of the third world among its policy objectives. Therefore, it is hardly possible to find out how we could co-operate with them in promoting it unless we take their own view, which has been consistent ever since the Russian Revolution, ever since 1917, that the evils, the problems and the social objections to societies in the third world as everywhere else, will only be solved when they accept the Soviet model of development.<lb/>
In other words, the problem of solving the needs of the third world is not something which can be done by aid. It is not something which can be done by encouraging their national institutions or their national cultures. It can simply and solely be done by giving what assistance is compatible with the other objectives of Soviet policy&#x2014;namely, self-preservation&#x2014;and what assistance is compatible with those objectives of
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0077"/>
<col>137</col>
establishing Marxist-Leninist r&#x00E9;gimes which in turn&#x2014;and the reference to Yugoslavia was pertinent&#x2014;must be prepared to accept Soviet interpretation of the way in which the history of the Marxist-Leninist part of the world is to run in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00594"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to intervene? As I understand it, his thesis is that the leaders of the Soviet Union are guided entirely in their foreign operations by the principles of Marxist-Leninism. How is that compatible with what we hear&#x2014;namely, that hardly anybody now in the Soviet Union believes in communism any more?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00595"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that there is any incompatibility between those two statements. There may be, and no doubt there is, a decline in the emotional adherence to the tenets of the communist faith in a country which has had a communist r&#x00E9;gime so long established. But that does not mean that the leadership do not interpret the affairs of the rest of the world in the terms of Marxist-Leninism. I see no contradiction whatever in those two views being held simultaneously.<lb/>
At present we are talking about our present predicament and the third world. What may be the situation in the 21st or 22nd centuries is a matter which your Lordships may wish to debate on another occasion; but if you do so I shall not be a participant. It is important to grasp this fact because it does present both the strength and the weakness of the Soviet Union. Undoubtedly the belief that that is the only suitable solution to the problems of the world gives a continuity, a pertinacity and in some cases a personal devotion, which any r&#x00E9;gime, any Government, might wish to have at their command. But it also&#x2014;and this has been pointed out in various local contexts&#x2014;runs up against the fact that it is very difficult to sell this view permanently to large numbers of people and, therefore, the ways in which it can be done are limited.<lb/>
First, there is the straight way of military conquest&#x2014;the Red Army paves the way for socialism. In spite of what my noble friend Lord Cork and Orrery has said, the Soviet Union does not, has never and, so far as I can see, never will repudiate in particular circumstances the use of force. It is using it&#x2014;to go no further&#x2014;in Afghanistan today. Indeed, it goes right back to the first destruction of the independent republic set up in the Caucasus after the Russian revolution in 1920 and 1921. That is one way, but it is a way which is limited by the fact, particularly today, that there exists an alternative focus of power in the world which the Soviet Union is highly unlikely to challenge.<lb/>
The other way is that of penetration of national movements&#x2014;originally anti-colonial movements in the era of colonialism, but today other national movements&#x2014;in such a way that they bear the brunt of changing the political scene while the nucleus of communists can take over at their leisure at a later stage. That method is occasionally rumbled. The most famous case of this occurred as long ago as 1927 when Chiang Kai-shek who had made use of the communists in the course of his advance against the
<col>138</col>
foreign powers that then held a dominant position in China, found that the communists were planning to supplant him and massacred them with some severity&#x2014;an event which has left its mark on the history of the Far East right up to this day. I cannot accept that the Chinese revolution would have been successful at the particular time it was successful, without at least the assistance given by the handing over to the communists of some of the resources amassed by Japan in Manchuria. But as regards the second occasion there was repudiation. Once a communist r&#x00E9;gime, apparently faithful to Moscow, was in power, there was the repudiation of Moscow leadership in 1960. So there are dangers also in penetration.<lb/>
Nevertheless, we ought not&#x2014;and here I agree with many noble Lords who have spoken&#x2014;to be complacent about this and to say that because, for example, Sadat got rid of the Russians and Siad Barre got rid of the Russians, other countries in due time will be able to do so. It will depend upon the local balance of forces. It will depend upon the extent to which these Governments are dependent, if not on Cubans, on East Germans, on Soviet citizens, on North Koreans&#x2014;the number of surrogates seems to be almost infinite. It will depend upon the ability and willingness of Western Governments to come in and fill what a breach with the Soviet Union would bring about.<lb/>
These are grave and difficult problems. There can certainly be no general solution. It is certainly an over-simplification to think that land reform or any other measure of social or economic betterment, would necessarily impede the progress of such movements and of communist parties manipulating them. But certainly one must begin&#x2014;and this is my final point&#x2014;by saying that here is a great empire and we, as the heirs of an empire, ought to be fascinated by studying its successes and its failures. It is only when we study it <i>sine ira et studio</i> can we hope&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00599"><member>Lord Stewart of Fulham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are much indebted to the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, for initiating this debate, and I think that he must feel rewarded by the quality of debate that has followed. It has been full of reliable, personal, first-hand information from many parts of the world, and it has been very soberly and earnestly argued. I would add that my own impression is that it has ended in more agreement than I thought likely at the beginning of the debate.<lb/>
There are two aspects to it. One is the consideration of the present situation; the next is the answer to the question: what do we do about it? On both of these&#x2014;and particularly on the second question of what should we do&#x2014;we found ourselves coming to a greater measure of agreement than I would have thought likely at the beginning of the debate. Let me
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0078"/>
<col>139</col>
try to begin by defining terms. First, I define "Soviet penetration and influence". We cannot deny that that exists. If one looks over all the continents in the world, time and again one will see that wherever there is difficulty of any kind, the Soviet Union is usually playing some active part in the matter. The attempt to penetrate is certainly there.<lb/>
Then there is the definition of "third world". So far as I can see, we, the United States and our allies make one world; the Warsaw Pact makes another; and what is left is presumably the third world. But the term has come to be used to designate particular countries of which you can predicate some of these things&#x2014;that they are poor, that they have newly come to independence, that they are non-white, that they are non-aligned. Not all those four propositions are true of all of them, but I think you find that for the countries that we call "the third world" usually at least three of those propositions are true, though not necessarily the same three in every case. These facts make the third world particularly liable to Soviet penetration.<lb/>
What are the forces behind Soviet penetration? I would agree to this extent with the noble Lord who has just spoken, that part of it is certainly an ideological drive. It is true that in communist writings&#x2014;particularly the writings of Lenin&#x2014;it is argued that communism will spread, and that it will spread particularly in countries that have been the subject of imperial rule or which are the victims of social injustice. But, in addition, today of course we find that another motive for Soviet penetration is a simple strategic one. You can look around the world and find plenty of places where there is injustice. However, the Soviet Government will be particularly interested in those where there is injustice and trouble of some kind and which also might be of strategic advantage to the Soviet Union if it could get control of them. I think that we see both these motives working in Soviet penetration, and it would be extremely unrealistic to deny it.<lb/>
But, of course, the penetration is most likely to be successful where there is internal weakness, where there is social injustice and particularly where there is one kind of oppression or another&#x2014;be it personal, class, particularly racial, or imperial. I listened with interest to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont. He was rather sharply critical of the speech of my noble friend Lord Cledwyn. I am bound to say that I am inclined to make one criticism of his speech and it is this. Charles Dickens writes in A <i>Tale of Two Cities</i> that the attitude of the English upper classes to the French Revolution appeared to be that it was the only harvest that had never been sown. It had occurred somehow, but there were no reasons in the previous history of the country to explain it. It seems to me that the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, was falling into that error. He referred to Cuba, Nicaragua, and E1 Salvador. At no time did he mention or describe the appalling misgovernment that preceded the rise to power of communists in those countries. The reason why Fidel Castro is where he is and to a certain extent why he stays where he is is due to the nature of the r&#x00E9;gime that he succeeded.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, was considering why the Cuban Government seemed to
<col>140</col>
have a hold over its people. Possibly one reason is a memory of what it was like before Castro came in, even if they have been somewhat disappointed in his r&#x00E9;egime. I am afraid that the other reason&#x2014;and it is rather a grim reflection on mankind&#x2014;is the degree of military success and prestige that Cuban forces have had. There is no surer way for a revolutionary government to bind its people to it than to have military successes. In his Diary, Samuel Pepys, describing one of the less fortunate events that occurred in this country in the wretched reign of Charles II, when we were humiliated abroad, remarked:
<quote>"Everyone is talking of old Oliver and what great things he did and made all the neighbour princes fear him".</quote>
As long as we have people talking seriously about the influence of Cuban forces in Africa, the ordinary Cuban will feel that his Government has something to be said for it.<lb/>
I have digressed a little, because I want to emphasise the point that it is no use at all talking about the Soviet penetration as if it sprang solely from the malice, ill-will or motivation of the Soviet Union. It succeeds where the soil is fertile, or where the defences are weak. As I say, the oppression can be social; it can be racial. That, of course, is what gives the position of South Africa in the African continent such a relevance in this whole field. It is something that we find very difficult to understand&#x2014;to be told that because of the colour of one's skin one is not temporarily but permanently excluded from equal political rights. For all the improvements they may have made in cricket matches, that is what the South African Government are, in fact, telling the majority of their people. While they do that there will be deep and bitter resentment and the people will tend to judge the other powers of the world by their attitude towards this doctrine of apartheid. I shall want to return to that matter again a little later.<lb/>
However, in this situation of the Soviet Union moved by strategic ambitions and by ideology and the world presenting many vulnerable spots, we get in consequence the Soviet penetration in Africa, Asia&#x2014;Afghanistan in particular&#x2014;and in Central America. Afghanistan is a particularly interesting case where a communist Government came to power basically because Afghanistan was one of the old-fashioned tyrannies that had very little to recommend it to its people. With the spread of modern ideas in the world, it was not surprising that communists took power there. But the Russians decided that the particular kind of communists there were not quite the right kind and that, anyhow, Soviet strategic interests would be greatly served if they were in control of Afghanistan. There you have a striking example of how the two motives have come together, and very unfortunate it has been for the people of Afghanistan.<lb/>
The Soviet Union tends to concentrate its penetration in those areas that are strategically advantageous to us and those where it can add to the general weakness and confusion of the West. My own feeling is that in the tangled problems of the Middle East, for a long time the main interest of the Soviet Union has been that the problem should remain unsolved and that the West should remain divided and, in consequence, weak. That more than anything else describes their behaviour. It is true, of course, that
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0079"/>
<col>141</col>
there have been a number of examples of countries which have admitted the Soviet influence in order to get themselves liberated from shocking social injustices and which, after a time, have found that it has not worked out in the least as they thought it would.<lb/>
There is a dreadful fable written by Robert Louis Stevenson in which he imagines a country where everybody had to wear an iron shackle on the right leg. There grew up in this country a zealous, heroic youth who thought he would rescue them. By long study he found that he must travel to a far country and slay the enchanter who was responsible for all this. This he did, and returned triumphant. The first person he met was wearing an iron shackle on his left leg. "Why are you doing that?" said the returning hero. "Oh, don't you know? We learnt that wearing it on the right leg was a superstition". They were the first example of people who changed one tyranny for another and who, I am afraid, were not much the better at the end of it. Where tyrannies exist, however, I am afraid that that still does not prevent people from trying to get rid of them and hoping for the best. Very often, having once embraced communist doctrine and Soviet help they find it is very difficult to get out of it even if they repent of their choice.<lb/>
In this tangled situation, what are we to do? I remember a song everybody sang very cheerfully towards the middle and closing years of the war. If I remember rightly, the refrain was:
<quote>"There'll be love and laughter,</quote>
<quote>And peace ever after,</quote>
<quote>Tomorrow, when the world is free".</quote>
Let nobody say it is politicians who deceive mankind; song-writers are just as responsible. We all had the feeling that when this fearful Nazi tyranny was overthrown there was a real chance for the world to start again. We are now learning (as we ought to have known if we had studied history) that it is never quite as simple as that. We now have an immense confusion of rights and wrongs in which it is increasingly hard to say exactly where right, truth and justice lie.<lb/>
We now have to face the question: what do we do in this situation? It was here that none of us on either side of the House was quite sure, and neither am I. I am quite sure of some things that we ought to do, but I am not sure that they will be adequate. There seemed to be a general feeling that in Central America it would be a mistake for the United States, by its own military power, to try to seek forcible solutions to what is now happening there. How far it may be wise for them to give military assistance to one side or another is largely a matter for them to judge, but we can at least say&#x2014;and this has been urged on both sides of the House&#x2014;that if there is any kind of coalition or middle way to be found in any of the countries concerned, they ought not to be too ready to find themselves on the same side as people like the Government of E1 Salvador. I am perfectly aware that that is not entirely an unequivocal or certain statement. All I can say is that it is the best I can make of the present extremely complicated situation.<lb/>
Next, we ought to use our influence in the world wherever we can to promote and encourage social justice. I think it was my noble friend Lord Oram who
<col>142</col>
urged this point, and my noble friend Lord Walston who drew the connection between land ownership and stability and freedom from communism. I think that to a considerable extent it was the land reforms of Venizelos in the early years of this century which resulted in Greece never embracing out-and-out a communist form of government. There are other examples as well.<lb/>
We were all agreed that we should try to extend many forms of aid to those parts of the third world which are not yet under Soviet control. In particular, I mention food aid in certain specialised circumstances, the help of technicians and of technology, and the work of the British Council&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, spoke particularly of the need to encourage their students. If I may say so, he must pursue that topic diligently with his Front Bench, and we shall all applaud while he does so. Seriously, there is no doubt that all that is perfectly sensible. Whether it is in time, whether it will be adequate, we do not yet know. It is certainly the kind of thing we ought to be trying at the present time.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Hatch suggested the possibility of joint projects of aid between ourselves and the Soviet Union, if I did not misunderstand him. I remember being present at a conversation between Sir Harold Wilson shortly before he became Prime Minister of this country and Mr. Khrushchev shortly before he ceased to be the ruler of the Soviet Union. Sir Harold Wilson put forward that we should try to find a part of the third world where we could jointly try to carry out an aid project. Mr. Khrushchev's reply was the sort of immediate reply you sometimes get from communists when you know you have pressed the right nerve and the response comes out automatically; namely, that we were different cultures, had different views of society, and therefore we should not be able to work together. Mr. Khrushchev has gone. It may be that Mr. Andropov will take a more liberal view, but I doubt it.<lb/>
Another thing we ought to do and which some noble Lords have mentioned, although not as many as I should have liked, is (and I have said this before) make our opposition to apartheid and the policies of the South African Government absolutely unequivocal. I cannot accept the view of the noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, that South Africa is gradually moving in the right direction. I wish I could. If it proves at any time that they are deciding to move in the right way and we can make it easier for them, by all means let us do so. In the meantime, we must make quite clear our steady opposition to apartheid and our readiness to approve all those measures which show South Africa how she cuts herself off from the rest of mankind by this policy.<lb/>
I know it can be said that there are other examples of tyranny&#x2014;even other examples of racial tyranny&#x2014;in the world. The distinguishing feature of the South African one is its extreme danger, being practised there in the African continent and inflaming feeling throughout black Africa. It is for that reason that we have to make clear our opposition to it and our complete dissociation from it.<lb/>
In general, we seem to feel that it should be possible, dangerous as the world is, to find a solution on the basis of seeking for greater justice, greater equality and
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0080"/>
<col>143</col>
the removal of the harsher features of life so far as they can be removed by aid and by international action. People have often argued which of the various mottos is more suitable for those who want peace. To say, "If you want peace, prepare for war", is a mere truism and does not help you. I think the right answer is found inscribed on the offices of the International Labour Office. I am not sure that I can imitate the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, and risk pronouncing the Latin, but roughly it can be translated:

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00601"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must add my thanks to my noble friend Lord Cathcart for drawing attention to one of the most important factors in the international situation today, and also&#x2014;and not for the first time&#x2014;I should like to express my thanks for the splendid speech which the noble Lord, Lord Stewart of Fulham, has just delivered. I expected Cubans to figure in your Lordships' debate today, but I had not thought that the perceptions of the average Cuban citizen of Cuban surrogates serving in Africa would be compared with fond memories of Oliver Cromwell during the time of restoration England. However, the noble Lord was able to make the comparison, and to make it in his own inimitable way.<lb/>
This debate has enabled the speeches of your Lordships to bring out the scale of Soviet activities in the third world and the threat which those activities present. If anyone doubts the nature of that threat not only strategically, but also in human terms to the individual citizen, then I would refer him to the speech made by my noble friend Lord Cork and Orrery. My noble friend Lord Beloff advised that we would do well to try to understand the motives of Soviet policy makers. I should like to try to follow my noble friend's advice and to look at the objectives which underlie Soviet activities in the third world. I emphasise from the outset, as indeed did the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, that the Soviet Union by no means always succeeds in its aims.<lb/>
All great powers have worldwide interests. That is unremarkable. But what is remarkable in the case of the Soviet Union is the narrow range of its interests. It seems that the Russian leadership is only capable of expressing its super-power status in military terms. If the Soviet Union were engaged more naturally&#x2014;indeed, more generously&#x2014;in economic affairs around the world, we might begin to see signs of greater interdependence with other countries, leading to greater restraint and greater responsibility in the conduct of its external relations.<lb/>
In the context of my noble friend's subject for discussion I shall not dwell upon the Soviet record in dealing with its immediate neighbours in Eastern Europe; the annexation in 1940 of the Baltic states and the postwar record of direct intervention in East Berlin, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The grim reality of an iron curtain rung down across the face of Eastern Europe is in many aspects as true today as it was when Winston Churchill coined the phrase nearly 40 years ago. The recent Soviet record in bringing pressure to bear on Poland to ensure the suppression of Solidarity is consistent with its past policy. I make those points
<col>144</col>
briefly because such attitudes and actions cannot but raise major questions about the Soviet Union's claim to be the friend of the oppressed in the third world.<lb/>
Since 1979, Soviet imperialism on its borders has been dramatically illustrated in Afghanistan; a formerly independent and non-aligned country, let us not forget, which has been occupied by Soviet troops, now numbering well over 100,000, for more than three years. Countless Afghan people, including women and children, have been killed and maimed. In many areas the economy has been permanently damaged. The Russians have destroyed irrigation and much of the agricultural infrastructure. Over three million refugees, one-fifth of the entire population of the country, have now fled to Pakistan and Iran. My noble friend Lady Airey expressed her apprehension about the territorial gains of the Russian troops, but resistance remains strong and the Russians have had no success at all in establishing a broad base of popular support for the client r&#x00E9;gime of Babrak Karmal.<lb/>
Internationally the United Nations General Assembly vote last autumn has demonstrated once again world condemnation is still as resolute now as it was in the immediate aftermath of the invasion in December 1979. Because of Afghanistan, the international standing of the Soviet Union has been gravely damaged. It must, I suggest, be our constant aim that this should not be forgotten until the Russian leadership withdraws and restores their lawful rights to the Afghan people.<lb/>
Soviet ideology has always attempted to portray the Soviet Union as being in the vanguard of progressive forces worldwide, to endorse the concept of just wars of national liberation. Under this banner the Soviet Union sought, in the immediate post-colonial period of the 1950s and 1960s, to present itself as the natural ally of the newly-independent countries in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. It claimed to be a super-power friend and ally with the political and economic answers for developing nations, but most countries have found to their cost that neither claim was borne out by experience.<lb/>
They found that the Soviet Union could and did provide arms and advisers, but technology to help their development, a market for their products, a currency with which they could trade or aid in any generous measure, were not the characteristics of the Soviet policy towards the third world. For all its rhetoric, the Soviet Union has proceeded on the basis of narrow political and economic self-interest combined&#x2014;and it has to be said&#x2014;with cynicism and opportunism. A comparatively recent example of this has been Soviet policy in the Horn of Africa, where in 1977 we saw a rapid Soviet switch from Somalia to Ethiopia. In Somalia and Djibouti the West has provided substantial assistance.<lb/>
I mention first the help given to deal with the enormous refugee problems. This help is needed in large measure because of the Soviet tendency to exacerbate, not to assuage, long-standing animosities in the area&#x2014;a tendency which was so clearly brought out in the most interesting speech of my noble friend Lord Ailsa. Their humanitarian assistance has been a mere token. They leave the relief work to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, which is funded by voluntary contributions (I need hardly add
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0081"/>
<col>145</col>
that the Soviet Union is not a contributor), to the bilateral help given by individual Western countries, and perhaps most important to the selfless efforts of the voluntary agencies to which I am glad to pay tribute because this country is so well represented. I cite just a few figures to illustrate the point. In 1982 European community aid for Somalia was &#x00A3;9 million of which our share was just over &#x00A3;2 million. We also gave half a million pounds for refugee relief in 1982&#x2013;83.<lb/>
In Somalia's case total Western economic assistance in 1981&#x2014;which is the last year for which I have figures&#x2014;amounted to 305 million dollars. Our own bilateral contribution last year amounted to just under &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million of which over half a million pounds was in the form of capital grants and about &#x00A3;1 million was for technical co-operation.<lb/>
We have helped in ways which met the practical needs of Somalia; for example, in developing the fisheries of a country which has perhaps the longest coastline in Africa, and in a scheme to tackle infestation by the tsetse fly&#x2014;that perennial scourge mentioned by my noble friend Lady Airey. But if the figures I have given for the United Kingdom's contribution sound small, let us remember the importance, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn said, that we must attach to the European Community dimension, for we contribute a substantial share to the European Development Fund, which I am glad to say has committed the equivalent of roughly &#x00A3;145 million for 1980&#x2013;85 to Somalia of which our contribution is about &#x00A3;27 million.<lb/>
It is instructive that notwithstanding the Russians' close relations with Ethiopia, the Soviet Union maintains its position principally by its willingness to sell arms and use its Cuban surrogates. The noble Viscount, Lord Buckmaster, gave two first hand examples of earthquakes occurring in states where no Soviet aid was then forthcoming. In Ethiopia there is a very serious drought and it is left to the West to provide the practical help. The United Kingdom, by no means the only contributor, has provided 27,000 tonnes of grain through the world food programme and we have given &#x00A3;400,000 for famine victims for distribution by the voluntary agencies. Again I reiterate the Government's appreciation of the agencies in which Britons play so large a part: Oxfam, Christian Aid and the Save the Children Fund. Recent events have reminded us&#x2014;if we needed reminding&#x2014;of the risks taken by those who readily work in places where the threat of guerrilla warfare exacerbates the harshness of natural catastrophe.<lb/>
The Soviet approach is best judged by what we see of its actions. In our own case, which I believe resembles that of other Western countries, our policy approach can simply be described thus: it is to promote British interests by helping reduce the tensions in the area thus enabling the countries concerned to concentrate on dealing with their political, economic and social problems free from outside interference.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Oram, who has great experience of these matters and who made a most interesting speech today, may not entirely agree with the Government about the means and the speed by which we try
<col>146</col>
to achieve those objectives, but I think he would agree that we are on the same wavelength in knowing that those are our aims.<lb/>
I should like to say just one word about the Horn of Africa. I should make quite clear that we recognise, in common with the OAU and the international community as a whole, these countries' existing boundaries. We are well aware of long-standing problems in the area which have yet to be resolved and successive British Governments have expressed the hope that they be solved by negotiation rather than fighting. We continue to hope for reconciliation and continue to believe that it must be sought within the existing framework of existing frontiers. I think that the situation in the Horn is an individual example of a wider truth. What is the Soviet Union's main contribution to its partners in the third world? The answer can be summed up in one word&#x2014;arms.<lb/>
We assess Russian arms sales to be of the order of 4 billion dollars to 5 billion dollars a year. Although this is a lesser global sum than the figure given by my noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing as far as Africa is concerned&#x2014;and therefore my noble friend and I are not quite seeing eye to eye on the figures we are giving&#x2014;I am sure that my noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing and I can certainly agree that the Soviet Union is the foremost arms dealer with the developing world&#x2014;a very doubtful position to be in.<lb/>
Net Soviet aid in 1982 amounted to 2&#x00B7;4 billion dollars, I am advised, the equivalent of &#x00B7;19 per cent. of Soviet GNP. This compares with over 25&#x00BD;billion dollars provided by the West in 1981. And 89 per cent. of Soviet aid is given to its closest client states, Vietnam, Mongolia, Cuba, Afghanistan, Laos and Cambodia. Aid, as we understand the term, remains negligible from the Soviet Union and much of it is provided on hard terms. Your Lordships may be surprised to know this; and I was surprised to learn it. We estimate that in 1982 developing countries other than the Soviet clients which I have mentioned made repayments arising from earlier Soviet aid loans which amounted to 110 million dollars more than they received in new loans&#x2014;hardly a creditable aid programme.<lb/>
There are two other areas to which I should like to refer. I take very seriously on behalf of the Government the references of my noble friend Lord Cathcart and other noble Lords to naval facilities which Russia has procured over past years. Like my noble friend Lord Ailsa, the Government attach importance to United States plans to improve facilities on Diego Garcia, which we regard as filling an important role in the protection of Western interests in the area. The facility helps us to respond flexibly to the threat of Soviet expansionism in the Indian Ocean and in its hinterland. It is sometimes argued that this threat is a figment of Western imagination: in effect, that if we pretended that it did not exist, it would not materialise at all. The reality is otherwise. About the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan there is nothing imaginary. Despite the problems that the Russians have got into in Afghanistan, they could well turn their attentions elsewhere in the region. I think that we are fortunate that Diego Garcia is there to be used if required, and it is symbolic of Western commitment and preparedness.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0082"/>
<col>147</col>
The other area, if I may turn to that, is Central America. Although there is little direct involvement by the Soviet Union in Central America at the moment, the Government are concerned at the spread of Marxist-Leninist ideology in that part of the world and the role which Cuba is playing in assisting the spread of that ideology in Central America&#x2014;a matter which was spoken about by many of your Lordships but not least by the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, in a very interesting speech, my noble friend Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Walston. Thus, although Central America is not&#x2014;except for Belize&#x2014;an area where major British interests are directly involved, we do share the fears that have been expressed in this House and elsewhere about the risks which a deterioration in the situation could pose for vital supply routes through the Caribbean and the Panama Canal where the interests of the whole free world must surely be involved. So we welcome the comprehensive restatement of United States policy in President Reagan's address to Congress on 27th April. We broadly support the basic goals which the President set out: support for democracy, reform and human freedom; continued help for economic development; assistance in protecting the security of the region's threatened nations; and support for dialogue both between and within countries as steps in the direction of a solution to the problems of the region.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, and the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, asked me about the Condadora front initiative. Her Majesty's Government are following closely the various recent moves by the Condadora group and others to try to resove the problems of Central America through some form of peace conference or dialogue. We must wait to see where this attempt will lead. The point that I would like to make in answer to the noble Lords is that we think it is for the countries of the region to find their own solution to these problems, but within the context of the very helpful points which I believe were made by the President of the United States on 27th April.<lb/>
I come finally to the ground to which all your Lordships have come: how does it really look to us in the final analysis? What are we to do? How are we to regard the repeated attempts of the Soviet Union to spread their ideology throughout the third world? As inevitable? I think not. Soviet reverses have been significant. They have been mentioned today, but they bear a last mention. In 1972 they were effectively expelled from Egypt; in 1977 from Somalia. Their invasion of Afghanistan has damaged their standing in the Islamic world and among the non-aligned countries. Although there were many things I did not agree with in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Hatch, I certainly do agree with the noble Lord that nominally Marxist and pro-Soviet r&#x00E9;gimes in Africa are increasingly seeking to strengthen their links with Western institutions, including the European Community.<lb/>
The cruel occupation of Cambodia by the Vietnamese, who are clients of the Soviet Union to the tune of over a billion pounds a year, has attracted the united opposition of the five ASEAN countries. Here,
<col>148</col>
again, there is a very important link between the European Community and the ASEAN countries, as was evidenced by the very fruitful conference between the Foreign Ministers of the states concerned on 24th and 25th March this year. I am glad to say that on more than one occasion island states of the South Pacific have, to my knowledge, rejected Soviet approaches designed usually to gain naval facilities of one kind or another.<lb/>
While, therefore, I share the serious concerns which have been expressed by your Lordships this evening, I see some causes on behalf of the Government for optimism, provided that, with our partners and allies, we continue to take practical steps to deal with the negative effects of Soviet policies in the third world. Provided we take a long view of our interests and a realistic assessment of the underlying problems with which most of the developing countries are grappling, surely there is no reason to flinch from competition with the Soviet Union in the third world. After all, our political message is infinitely more attractive. Our economic model is incomparably more productive. We must continue, I accept, to offer aid, trade and technology&#x2014;all the things which the Soviet Union singularly fail to provide in adequate quantities even for their clients. We must continue to lend our support to individual countries wherever they are pepared to uphold standards of freedom, self-determination and resistance to domination.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Gaming (Amendment) Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00603">8.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00604"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. As a public company of which I am chairman has an interest in one licensed bingo club, I declare that as an interest; but I hasten to emphasise that the reason I am pleased to be taking the initiative in commending this Bill to Parliament is in no way connected with that interest. I am doing it because, in the first place, I believe in the content of the Bill of course but I also believe that the subject matter is ideally suited to the Private Bill procedure which we are using now. It covers the three main ingredients that I think a Private Bill ought to have. It is extremely modest in its scope and it has the approval of the Gaming Board, a statutory body set up by the Government in 1968. The third reason is that it will add to the enjoyment of something like 6 million people in this country.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0083"/>
<col>149</col>
In looking back at the beginnings of the Gaming Act, which this Bill is intended slightly to amend, history shows that the general intention which inspired the 1968 Gaming Act clearly has been attained: that is, the general intention. Then in 1968&#x2014;and most of us will remember it&#x2014;it was recognised that bingo had an innocent and worthwhile appeal to many people. It was recognised at the same time that without some legislative control there was a risk that ill-intentioned promoters might unfairly exploit the appeal of that game for self-advantage. There was that risk: anything that verges on gaming carried that risk with it. But now, after 14 years of that 1968 Act, it can safely be claimed that because of the Gaming Board's powers, plus the police surveillance and the quality of the promoters who have emerged under that Act, all the apprehensions of possible risks have been mitigated and in most cases removed altogether.<lb/>
As is usual in such matters as this&#x2014;thinking back again to 1968&#x2014;when framing the original Gaming Act, Parliament built into its clauses every foreseeable protection against possible misuse of any of the licences that were to be granted under the Act&#x2014;every one you could think of. That is Parliament's job in bringing forward legislation that gives new powers to people. It is Parliament's job to try to anticipate any weaknesses or possible misuses that may arise and to try to include them in the legislation in order to avoid such things happening on any scale.<lb/>
That was certainly done as regards the 1968 Gaming Act. Every foreseeable protection against any possible misuse, however remote, was built into it. But now, with hindsight following 14 years' experience, it can be seen that, while the main structure of the 1968 Act has proved to be the right vehicle for implementing Parliament's intentions on that part of the Gaming Act, I think any reasonable person would admit that that legislation was over-protective in many of its detailed restrictions. As a result of that, because so many of these things were written in which I believe have proved to be unnecessary in actual operation, it means that the people who are now running the clubs that were allowed under that legislation are having to face all sorts of problems and obstacles which make it almost impossible for the fully approved clubs&#x2014;and they cannot be a club unless they have passed the test of their suitability by the Gaming Board and all the investigation that carries with it&#x2014;to attract new members to replace the inevitable fall-out of old members.<lb/>
It is almost impossible to compete fairly with other forms of entertainment that do not have these restrictions built into legislation affecting them. It is almost impossible to combat the impact of the recently-arrived newspaper bingo competitions, with their jumbo-sized cash prizes. It is because the experience of 14 years has shown so clearly that this over-protection is defeating what was the main object of the original Act&#x2014;to allow this to happen in a good, healthy way which would encourage lonely people to have somewhere to go without doing themselves any sort of harm&#x2014;and because we have had that over-protection, that this Bill I am now presenting for the second time has been framed.<lb/>
I have to say that it is mainly to meet this last newspaper competition that the Bill itself has been
<col>150</col>
designed after lots of consultation with the authorities by the two official bingo associations, which are only too eager to comply with the law and to do it in a way that will bring satisfaction to their clients, who are many. It is a design which I am able to say&#x2014;that is, this Bill I am now presenting&#x2014;meets with the approval of the Gaming Board and I hope that it will be given a fair wind by all sides of this House in order that we can progress to the varying stages of amending the original Act in a way which will make it more acceptable and more desirable, both to the country and to the people who use the clubs.<lb/>
The Bill sets out to permit a national scheme of bingo to be played regularly in many licensed bingo halls simultaneously&#x2014;at the minute they are separate&#x2014;by means of a telecommunication link and central control. It is now possible, with all the new inventions in telecommunications, for this sort of thing to be done easily and efficiently. As of the minute, it is not possible to have a wide number of clubs working simultaneously together with the use of that aid, which puts them at a disadvantage alongside the newspaper bingo schemes, which have no restrictions at all on them.<lb/>
Linked games of bingo are already specially provided for under the present Act, but the Act limits the amount of prize money which can be won. As a consequence of this limit, at the minute it means that no more than four clubs at the most can play together under the type of scheme that would bring it somewhat within the realm of a newspaper scheme.<lb/>
As I said, the Gaming Act 1968&#2014;15 years ago&#x2014;set this legal limit on prizes, and it has not been altered. The legal limit that was imposed in 1968 takes no account of inflation and the new value of money, which means that the figures, which may have seemed fairly reasonable then, have now dropped to a point which one can only describe as derisory in terms of their being a reasonable attraction to the people who want to use their leisure in this way. One must remember that prizes in other forms of small-stake gambling, such as football pools, horse-racing jackpots and, recently, newspaper bingo, run into six figures, with all the attraction and excitement that that brings. I am not suggesting that we want to compete at that level, but under this Bill it is possible to bring the derisory level under the 1968 Act to one which is more sensible and attractive.<lb/>
This restriction on bingo hall proprietors, however well conceived it was thought to be in 1968, has had the effect of disabling club proprietors from legitimately defending their business from the incursions of these other forms of gambling. The difference between the position under the old Act and these other operations, which have no restrictions at all, is tantamount to a charge of unfair trading, although in much of our other legislation we have gone to a lot of trouble to try to avoid what we consider to be unfair trading between people who are competing with one another.<lb/>
But it does not end there. The bingo proprietor is unable to tell people about the services he can offer, limited though they are. He is not able to tell the public at large about these comfortable, well-managed meeting places, where there is social intercourse and togetherness for many who would otherwise be lonely.
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0084"/>
<col>151</col>
I emphasise that. If we remove ourselves from the level of the High Court of Parliament and go into the towns and villages in this country, we will see that the people who regularly attend the bingo clubs, who are mainly middle-aged and elderly ladies find a happy atmosphere in well-conducted premises, which goes a long way towards removing that feeling of loneliness from which so many of them suffer. They are able to participate together in a way which suits them.<lb/>
This Bill is merely intended to redress the balance, to some extent, by allowing the bingo halls to link together from time to time on a national scale, whereby larger money prizes may be offered to members of the participating bingo clubs. Even now, despite the uncontrolled competition outside, this Bill provides for a maximum individual prize under this linking of no more than &#x00A3;50,000. The stake being laid by each individual player will still be a very modest sum of money, and the licensed bingo hall will still have to adhere to the criteria laid down in the original Act. Under my Bill, sadly, the proprietor will still not be able to advertise this new attraction to the public, but must confine himself merely to telling members of his club all about it. This Bill does not ask for any concessions on that matter.<lb/>
But I quite soberly warn that, unless the changed circumstances of today, compared with 1968, are taken into account the survival of this form of recreation is truly in peril. The word "peril" may seem an emotional and dramatic one to use in connection with the game of bingo, which we sometimes laugh at and pass off but it is a form of recreation which means a great deal to many people. Unless we can bring up to date the general circumstances in which clubs are run, and take present circumstances into account, I quite firmly warn your Lordships that the very existence of these clubs is in peril.<lb/>
I would remind your Lordships that this is not an inconsiderable industry. It provides &#x00A3;52 million a year to the Exchequer; it provides jobs and a living for tens of thousands of staff; and it provides recreation for 13&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the adult population of Britain. This is the general case that I had in mind when this Bill received its First Reading in this House on 30th March this year. Though unbeknown to me then, four weeks later, on 26th April, an impartial report for 1982 was issued by the Gaming Board, which confirmed all of these last points. I quote Clause 45:
<quote>"The figure for the 12 months ended 31st August 1982 was &#x00A3;469 million. This figure represented a decrease of 4&#x00B7;5 per cent. compared with the figure for the previous 12 months. It is the first time since the Board have published figures that there has been a decrease."</quote>
I quote Clause 46 of the Gaming Board's report, which states:
<quote>"The number of clubs licensed under Part II of the Gaming Act 1968 continued to decrease. The number of clubs licensed at 31st December"</quote>
decreased from 1,720 in 1978 to 1,556 in 1982.<lb/>
I quote Clause 49, which states:
<quote>"The number of clubs participating in linked bingo declined slightly from 1,091 to 1,013. The number of links operated decreased from 344 to 322."</quote>
I quote Clause 52(a):
<quote>"The number of regular bingo players seems to have decreased again, from about 5&#x00B7;7 million to about 5&#x00B7;4 million&#x2014;which would mean that about 13&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the adult population played bingo."</quote>
<col>152</col>
I quote Clause 67:
<quote>"The were 7,370 certificated staff in the bingo and gaming industries on 1st December. This is a reduction of about 600 in casinos and 200 in bingo as compared with 1981."</quote>
That is confirmation of the peril that I say exists unless we bring the position up to date. It comes from the impartial report of the statutory body which was set up by the Government, which confirms the scenario that I have tried to describe, supported by facts, figures and impartial reports. It is because all those facts go together that I confidently ask this House to give the Bill a Second Reading. My Lords, I beg to move.<lb/>
Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Harmar-Nicholls.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00605">8.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00606"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with a lightness of touch and without too much of a sense of pathos, the noble Lord, Lord Harmar-Nicholls, has moved your Lordships from the problems of the third world to the problems of the bingo world. Because it is a world with which I am not too familiar, I, too, in order to judge the merits of the Bill which the noble Lord has presented to the House for a Second Reading, referred to the report of the Gaming Board for 1982, to which the noble Lord made very adequate reference. I shall not repeat the paragraphs he quoted to your Lordships. They showed without any doubt that there has been a decrease in the bingo industry and in the number of people who attend bingo clubs.<lb/>
The noble Lord believes that one of the main reasons for this is the restrictive nature of the Gaming Act 1968 and the conditions which have been imposed thereunder. However, the noble Lord mentioned the competing force from Fleet Street in the form of the free bingo competitions, with lurid prizes, which so many Sunday and other newspapers now offer. It may very well be that this is a greater restraining element than the restrictions which the noble Lord mentioned. Your Lordships may feel it is a shame that our great newspaper industry does not use better presentation of news and more attractive features in its newspapers to increase circulation instead of competitions of this kind. However, the purpose of the Bill is not to try to restrict any newspaper competition which there may be; it is to ensure that the bingo industry, in the words of the noble Lord, does not die.<lb/>
There are some interesting facts to which the noble Lord did not refer, only because he was limited by time. The information which he gave to your Lordships was extremely interesting. However, may I add that attendances have fallen drastically and that it is obvious that the majority of bingo players are ladies who are no longer particularly young. May I quote an interesting sentence which is to be found on page 18 of the Gaming Board's report:
<quote>"The percentage of the players who were men went down slightly from 17 per cent. in 1980 to 16 per cent. in 1982 and the percentage of players who were under 30 went down from 11 per cent. in 1980 to 10 per cent. in 1982".</quote>
Therefore, one's first deduction is that most of the participants are ladies who no longer have the full bloom of youth. Secondly, it may well be&#x2014;the Talbot Report which was recently produced by the industry said so&#x2014;that this industry has a social content which is of use to the community.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0085"/>
<col>153</col>
Next I looked at the report of the Gaming Board to see whether the social content is nullified to a large extent because those who participate in the clubs are tempted to gamble with a quantity of money which they can ill afford. Therefore, I was interested and pleased to note, again on page 18 of the report, that the average amounts paid for admission and as participation fees over the past six surveys were, in the larger clubs, 20p in 1972, whereas they were &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;24 in 1982 (where the capacity was 751 to 1,000) and &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;40 where the capacity was over 1,000. So far as the smaller clubs are concerned, the figure was &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;11 where the capacity was up to 500 and &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;28 where the capacity was between 501 and 750. The average amounts staked with the larger clubs were &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;10 in 1972 and &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;27 in 1982 where the capacity was 751 to 1.000, &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;86 where the capacity was over 1,000 and &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;17 where the capacity was 501 to 750. Therefore, one approaches the subject&#x2014;and certainly the proposals made in the Bill&#x2014;in the knowledge that this is not hard gambling.<lb/>
With both of those aspects in view, this Bill seeks to make it possible for bingo, on account of the benefits of modern technology and computers, to become a national game. When I heard the noble Lord say that, I pricked up my ears because I thought he was going to say "a nationalised game". However, bearing in mind where the noble Lord sits, I thought that that must be wrong and I found that indeed he was only talking about a national game. One can see that there are attractions about that, but I believe that the House will want to make very sure that if the Bill meets with the approval of the Government (the noble Lord has said that it has the approval of the Gaming Board) very definite safeguards are laid down.<lb/>
One notices that, according to the Bill, concerted bingo games would have to be under the supervision of the Secretary of State, that rules and regulations would have to be laid down and that there would have to be the right to inspect the machines and the places at which this larger bingo game would be carried on. Your Lordships may believe that it would be necessary to have real safeguards because the opportunities for cheating, whether by the staff or anybody else, are great. I am sure that the public would want to feel that they were adequately safeguarded, otherwise the whole of the bingo industry would be disgraced and would fall into ill repute.<lb/>
It seems that the Bill deserves a Second Reading, provided that care is exercised at the Committee and Report stages to incorporate the safeguards I have just mentioned. I do not wish to resist its Second Reading, but I await with interest, having heard that the Gaming Board favours the Bill, the Government's response.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00608"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened to my noble friend Lord Harmar-Nicholls with great interest, as he has spelt out the background against which this Bill must be seen. Essentially, that background is one of decline in the popularity of bingo. Bingo seems to have reached the peak of its popularity in the early 1970s, when average daily attendances were near the half million mark. Since then, attendances have
<col>154</col>
declined steadily (except in 1974 when there was a slight rise), and in 1982 average daily attendances were 358,550&#x2014;which represented a drop of 13 per cent. on 1981 figures. The number of licensed clubs reached a peak in 1974, with 1,820 clubs licensed in Great Britain. The figure for 1982 was down to 1,556 of which only 1,451 were actually operating. The picture is thus one of steady decline since the early 1970s, with an accelerated decline in the past two or three years.<lb/>
I shall not trouble your Lordships with speculation about the reasons for the decline in bingo&#x2014;several have already been advanced. We could all, no doubt, think of different explanations for its loss of popularity. What is clear is that those who run the bingo clubs believe that their business is unduly restricted by the controls contained in the Gaming Act 1968. This Bill seeks to remove some of those controls, to enable bingo clubs to combine on a group, regional or even national basis to provide a joint game with aggregated stake money and a maximum top prize of &#x00A3;50,000.<lb/>
Before I deal with the Bill itself, it may be helpful to your Lordships if I briefly set out the background to the controls in the 1968 Act which this Bill seeks to amend. The 1968 Act was introduced because the controls in the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 had proved to be inadequate to prevent damaging social excesses in casinos and bingo clubs. To all intents and purposes, bingo clubs had converted themselves into public gaming houses. The purpose of the 1968 Act was to purge commercial gaming of its criminal elements, to cut out excessive profits, and to ensure that play was honestly conducted in decent surroundings. To that end a distinction was drawn between bingo clubs and casinos. Casinos were made subject to rigorous controls, to cater for confirmed or determined gamsters, while the controls on bingo were designed to restrict it to a neighbourly and sociable form of gaming for moderate prizes, and to encourage the provision of amusements and entertainments in the clubs.<lb/>
Today we have only around 120 casinos&#x2014;about one-tenth of the number which operated in the early 1960s&#x2014;but almost every high street has a licensed bingo club, and these places have become an important part of the social life of many people. Indeed, recent research has shown that for many members, winning a prize is not the main reason for playing bingo. Many housewives and pensioners rely on the club as a place to meet old friends and make new ones. It is often their only recreation outside the home. The clubs therefore perform an innocent and important function.<lb/>
But bingo is gambling, and gambling does have its dangers&#x2014;particularly for vulnerable members of the community and those of limited means. Up to now, the controls in the 1968 Act have been effective in ensuring that bingo clubs have provided gambling on a modest scale&#x2014;a scale which does not, by and large, attract the compulsive or avaricious gambler. That is the test which the Government believe should continue to be applied to proposals for changes in the law.<lb/>
The question we have to ask ourselves is this: is this proposal for joint games consistent with the idea of the bingo club as a neighbourly and social place in which
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0086"/>
<col>155</col>
large sums of money cannot easily or quickly be lost? Our initial reaction was one of reserve but, on the basis of the information which the bingo associations have now given the Gaming Board about how it is intended these games should be run, and subject to certain qualifications which I shall mention, the Government now believe that the proposal is broadly acceptable.<lb/>
Our understanding is, first, that the stakes will be low; about 10p or 20p for a card. Secondly, that these joint games will not drive out all ordinary games of bingo but will be played, at most, once nightly in place of one ordinary game. Thirdly, in addition to the winner of the joint game (who might win as much as &#x00A3;50,000) there will always be a club winner, who will also win a prize. None of these is evident on the face of the Bill; it is intended that these matters shall be dealt with in regulations or in the scheme to be approved by the Gaming Board&#x2014;and no doubt the bingo associations have been reluctant to undertake too much detailed planning without having some confidence that the principle was likely to be accepted.<lb/>
However, although the Government are prepared in principle to accept the idea of joint games, we are not prepared to give this Bill our support until the details of how the games are to be played and controlled are settled and agreed with the Gaming Board and the Home Office. We believe that Parliament should have that assurance before being asked to consider such a change in the law.<lb/>
It may be helpful at this point if I indicate to your Lordships some of the points on which the Government believe that further work must now be done. As we understand it, the game and the cards used for each game will be controlled by computer. The numbers called in each game will be predetermined and printed on a master card distributed sealed to each club, together with the participants' cards to be used in that game. There is here a clear potential for fraud. Someone with access to the computer could find out which card had the winning numbers printed on it&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, made that clear. Naturally the promoters will be as anxious as anyone to prevent this, but it is something on which Parliament will require to be satisfied.<lb/>
Then there is the predetermined nature of the game. This poses difficulties. The essential character of bingo is that it is a game of equal chance. In normal bingo, which is played simultaneously, the numbers called are entirely random and known only at the time of calling&#x2014;so that at the beginning of each game, each participant has a genuinely equal chance of winning. In this joint game, that will not be so. At the beginning of the game, the winner will already be determined because the numbers to be called will already be fixed. The game then becomes akin to an instant lottery&#x2014;it will be the card picked that will determine the winner, not the numbers called. At the beginning of the game, most people will have no chance of winning because they will have cards with totally inappropriate numbers.<lb/>
The fact that the game will be played at different times and places also poses problems. Suppose that the winner of the joint game is found in a club which plays the game early in the evening. Anyone buying a card for the same game in another club later that evening
<col>156</col>
will clearly have no chance of winning the joint game. There is, of course, no statutory definition of bingo but it is not easy at first sight to see how this new game, with its predetermined numbers, can be woven into the fabric of the Gaming Act. That is why we believe further and more detailed discussions are necessary between the bingo associations, the Home Office and the Gaming Board so that these points can be sorted out. They will most certainly require amendments to the Bill.<lb/>
There is one further and important qualification to mention, and this concerns the promotion of the game, and of bingo generally, through advertising. At present, the law prohibits the advertising of gaming&#x2014;and that includes bingo. There are specific exemptions for a notice on licensed premises indicating that gaming takes place there; for advertisements in respect of grant, renewal or transfer of a licence; and in respect of newly-licensed premises. The effect of the relevant section of the 1968 Act, Section 42, is, however, uncertain. It is now not uncommon for advertisements to be displayed on premises licensed for bingo giving the amount of major prizes which are or could be won or the aggregatee amount of prize money won over a period. Your Lordships must have seen such advertisements in your travels around any town.<lb/>
The Government believe that the opportunity should now be taken to clarify the position and to tighten controls in one area while relaxing them in another. We agree with the Royal Commission on Gambling that advertising the size of prizes gives undue emphasis to the gambling rather than the social aspects of bingo. This would be even more so were prizes of &#x00A3;50,000 nightly advertised. So we believe that the advertising of prizes should stop; but we see no reason why the clubs should not advertise their social facilities. They are rightly proud of these and they form much of the attraction of the clubs.<lb/>
Clearly care will need to be taken in considering how to give effect to the intended relaxation in the law without negating the tightening aspect&#x2014;and the Bill as it stands will need amending. Nevertheless, I hope it is clear from what I have said that the Government are not unsympathetic to the aims of this Bill. I have dwelt at some length on the points of difficulty, not because I want to pour cold water on the proposal but rather the reverse. It is because we are prepared to accept the proposal in principle that I have taken the trouble to indicate the areas where further work needs to be done if these joint games are ever to be played in practice.<lb/>
I know that my noble friend Lord Harmer-Nicholls, is anxious to see this Bill make headway. The best way for it to make headway is for the bingo associations now to discuss and reach agreement on these matters with the Home Office and the Gaming Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00609">9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00610"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel a certain amount of satisfaction from that reply, but I have to say that it is very limited. We agree in principle that what is behind the Bill, if it could be implemented properly, is satisfactory to the Government. We know that it is satisfactory to the Gaming Board. I believe
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0087"/>
<col>157</col>
that the time has come when it ought to be implemented. So we have agreed in principle. To that extent I am grateful to my noble friend for reflecting the Government's point of view.<lb/>
I do not see why all the special protection that my noble friend suggested cannot be dealt with in Committee. I think it could. The object of a Committee stage is to put the flesh on the bones of a good idea which is set out on Second Reading. I feel that all the desires to make certain that there should be no cheating and that everything is properly run could be incorporated in the Bill, or the regulations that come under it, to give satisfaction to everyone. It is with that hope in mind that I think we ought to take this Bill through its next stages.<lb/>
I can promise my noble friend that the bingo associations, who are expert in these matters, will tomorrow make contact with both the Home Office and the Gaming Board with a view to seeing whether we can find words which will meet the doubts expressed by my noble friend as to whether or not it can be operated fairly.<lb/>
May I in a friendly way issue a note of warning? If my noble friend is so concerned about whether or not computers can be run correctly to meet the need of the nation properly and without cheating under this Bill, he must be careful that he does not throw doubt on the computer which operates for the ERNIE premium bonds. If a computer in one field can be manipulated, there is the suggestion that it can be manipulated in another. I purchased a lot of premium bonds when the scheme was instigated but I have not had any winnings. Is it because the computer has been manipulated, or is it that we know from the experience of operating ERNIE that this machine operates properly? I prefer to believe the second reason and I believe that that applies to the operation of this Bill.<lb/>
I suggest that we now give the Bill a Second Reading in the knowledge that there is still much work to be done in Committee and on Report to satisfy the Government, very properly, on all the safeguards that are necessary. That should be done without any delay and I hope that the Home Office will not drag its feet in getting together with the experts on the side of the promoters to find the sort of answer to the queries put forward by my noble friend and by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, who I thank very much for his support. I recognise the apprehensions that he had if the proposals in the Bill are not properly implemented.<lb/>
As we agree in principle, which is the main thing, and we have an undertaking from the Government that they look with sympathy to a little bit more advertising for the social side of the club premises, if not to the prize money levels, we have gained something. Let us hope that in the remaining stages of the Bill that we can reach a point where everybody will be satisfied with what, at the end of the day, is a very popular form of recreation. I beg to move.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Citizens Advice Bureaux: Grant</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00611">9.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00612"><member>Lord Winstanley</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's government whether they will explain the reasons for the uncertainty about the allocation of grant for 1983&#x2013;84 to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in view of the fact that neither of the Statements made in both Houses on April 12th and 27th made any reference to those reasons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00613">The noble Lord said: My Lords. I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper, I should declare something of an interest. As many noble Lords know, I have spent much of my time during the past 13 years presenting a TV advice and information programme&#x2014;a kind of Citizens Advice Bureau of the air&#x2014;in the Granada area in the North-West of England. In that capacity I have been deeply dependent on the services of CABs and I have worked closely with them on a daily basis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00614">It therefore follows that I could not fail to be aware of the damage which was&#x2014;and I emphasise and underline "was"&#x2014;being done to the morale of the organisation by all the rumour, speculation and innuendo which inevitably arose from this recent and, in my view, regrettable episode. My Question, as now amended, as noble Lords will have noticed, merely asks for the reasons for that uncertainty over the funding of the NACAB for 1983&#x2013;84. None of those reasons was given in either of the Statements made to both Houses of Parliament on 12th April and later on 27th April. I am constantly being asked for the reasons. I think it is right to say that friends and acquaintances who work very closely in the CABs, have come to me in large numbers and asked me what on earth has been going on. They say they are all desperately worried and feel very uncomfortable and have an awful feeling that something has been going on in London that they do not know about.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00615">The reasons, if there are reasons, ought to be given. Looking at the Statements, it is apparent that they do not give the reasons. The Statement on 12th April does not give what the reasons were but only what one of the reasons was not. The statement says:
<quote>"These steps have absolutely nothing to do with the current CND campaign".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00616">If they had nothing to do with it, why mention it? It might just as well say that it had nothing to do with the industrial dispute at Cowley or ship repairing in Malta, or whatever. Perhaps the clue lies earlier in the Statement. In the same column reference is made to the need for,
<quote>"avoiding activities which can be seen as politically motivated".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report.</i> 12/4/83; col. 116.]</quote>
That is a question to which I shall want to refer in more general terms and on which I must ask the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, some specific questions a little later.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00617">I should like to make it absolutely clear that the NACAB is now wholly satisfied with the outcome of this dispute, if dispute be the proper word. Indeed, I am aware that the NACAB would have preferred me to withdraw this Question. I acknowledge that it asked me to withdraw it and in its efforts to persuade me to do so it told me that not only has the NACAB now got
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0088"/>
<col>159</col>
everything it wanted but it had in fact got more. I had to reply that, far from allaying my suspicions that information, if anything, aroused them still further. It seemed to suggest that perhaps there was some element of guilt on the part of the Government and that an injustice had been done to the NACAB for which amends should, and had, been made. But I have no wish to rock that particular boat.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00618">I believe that the inquiry which is now on foot&#x2014;an inquiry agreed and welcomed by the NACAB&#x2014;will in the end show that the organisation is under-funded rather than the reverse. But I think that the inquiry may also point to ways of making the NACAB even more effective than it now is: for example, by more co-operation and integration with other voluntary bodies and even closer links with central and local government departments. But I am bound to say that it seems to me that the link with central Government will not have been strengthened by the recent episode.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00619">Only one point remains about which I am not yet entirely happy so far as the NACAB is concerned, and that is the possible effect on local government funding of CABs in their areas. As we all know, local government is under very heavy pressure financially. Some councils may have been tempted to delay, however temporarily, their funding of the CABs in their areas. I hope that at the end of this debate, the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, will be able to tell the House that his department has used its best endeavours to make absolutely sure that that does not happen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00620">I have persisted with this Question because, as I said earlier, I believe that some very important points of principle regarding the relationship between the Government and voluntary bodies arise from this whole matter. These principles are highlighted in a letter to <i>The Times</i> of 15th April from Mr. Peter Jay, who was writing in his capacity as Chairman of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Among other things, this letter refers to the importance so far as these various national voluntary bodies are concerned of securing:
<quote>"the proper balance between independence and accountability".</quote>
These are bodies which have become increasingly dependent upon central Government funding, and there are many of these bodies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00621">That brings me back to the words that I quoted from the Statement to your Lordships' House on 12th April, referring to the need for:
<quote>"avoiding activities which can be seen as politically motivated".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00622">Mr. Peter Jay's letter does say that he thinks that perhaps the Charity Commissioners can look after this whole matter, and I say at the outset that I do not accept that. I do not think that is a satisfactory solution or a satisfactory safeguard. But, Mr. Jay's letter goes on to say:
<quote>"There remains lamentable confusion about what is and what is not 'political' activity. Case law suggests that some aims are classified as political whereas others are not, even though both seek to influence public policy, legislation, etc; and this breeds suspicion that the judgment between them is itself 'political', with a bias against those who would change rather than conserve the status quo.</quote>
<quote>It would be more in accordance with the principle that law should be clear, ascertainable and predictable if a simpler, more objective test were adopted&#x2014;namely, that politics is essentially about the retention and transference of government power and that, in a democratic society and in the present context, 'political' activity
<col>160</col>
consisted only of activity whose aims include, overtly or covertly, the influencing of the electoral process in favour of (or against) any person or party".</quote>
This is a difficult area. If I may say so, it is well illustrated in an excellent report to the Minister for Consumer Affairs, published only last week. It is a report by the National Consumer Council on information and advice services in the United Kingdom. It shows the complexity and the vast number of organisations operating in the field&#x2014;organisations upon which the Government of the day are deeply dependent and which themselves are dependent on central Government for funding. It illustrates the complexity of the scope of their various activities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00623">The problem here is that this kind of organisation changes. Many of them start off as help organisations. For example, Shelter started its career as a body trying to do what it could to house the homeless, but it very rapidly became a campaigning body, acting in the main to pressurise local authority housing departments. More recently, CLEAR, the voluntary body campaigning for the recognition of the danger of lead in the environment and so on&#x2014;a body which is not, I think, in receipt of Government funding&#x2014;campaigned and influenced public opinion, as a result of which the Government recently changed policy. That is a decision which I commend and upon which I congratulated the Government. That activity by a voluntary body was political, but the essential point is that it was not party political.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00624">Returning to the Statement of 12th April referring to the need for,
<quote>"avoiding activities which can be seen as politically motivated"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 12/4/83; col. 116.],</quote>
I think that it would be extremely regrettable if a vital and important body like the CABs nationally felt inhibited about occasionally taking steps in order to change legislation. The NACAB has done that successfully on many occasions. I remember that it mounted a campaign about the anomalies and injustices which arose from the 5 pence concessionary television licence for certain elderly people but not for others. As a result, the Government changed the rules&#x2014;and rightly. That activity was political, but it was not party political.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00625">I have never seen any evidence, anywhere, of the NACAB adopting a stance which is in favour of one political party rather than another. If ever it did&#x2014;even if it adopted a stance which was in favour of my political party&#x2014;my association with it would be at an end. It is very important that after this episode the NACAB should understand its right to advise Government about the need for changes in legislation, about gaps in services, or about special needs of which it becomes aware through the very important function which it fulfils on the Government's behalf. The Government are dedicated to improving the take-up of certain benefits, and we now know that the actual take-up of many benefits depends upon the degree and nature of the activity of the CABs in certain areas. It must be made clear that doing that kind of thing, or pointing out deficiencies in legislation, is not party political, though it must be political.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00626">I add no more, save to say to the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, that I genuinely believe that his presence here at this very late hour will itself have done
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0089"/>
<col>161</col>
something to reassure the Citizens Advice Bureaux because I believe that it will have indicated the importance which his department attaches to morale in the organisation. I am very grateful to him for his presence here at this very late hour. I hope that he is able to reassure us on the various points: first, that clear, coherent, and unequivocal advice has been given to local government with regard to the funding of the bureaux, which is important; secondly, that no attempts will be made to restrain voluntary bodies which are in receipt of Government funds from activities designed to influence legislation as opposed to activities which, frankly, are party political. If the noble Lord can clearly and unequivocally give us a reassurance on those points, my Unstarred Question at this very inconvenient and late hour will not have been in vain, and it will have proved necessary to have dragged along the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, at this time of night.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00627">9.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00628"><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for not withdrawing this Question, because I believe that there is here something which needs clarification. In Scotland, it is felt that whatever happened did not happen in Scotland, and so far as I know, that is perfectly true. I am very glad that my noble friend Lord Cockfield is answering the Question, because I am quite certain that he will make the position quite clear. I am told that a review&#x2014;not an inquest&#x2014;is taking place on what is going on. In Scotland we have had two reviews in the last few years. One review was carried out in 1981 by the Department of Trade and Industry and Commission Services. In 1982 there was another review by staff inspectors for the Department of Industry and Trade Commission Services of the Establishment Management Services Manpower Division. Both of the reviews were carried out at the request of the Scottish association itself. We wonder whether another inspection is necessary at this time, or whether the matter refers only to England.<lb/>
I ask the noble Lord to bear in mind that the Scottish citizens advice bureaux have been developing quite rapidly. In 1975 the various bureaux were federated together, and in 1980 the federation became independent. The organisation is, curiously enough, run mostly by women, and there are about 30,000 inquiries a year. What I believe is important is the fact that about 90 per cent. of those people working in the organisation are volunteers, and it is extremely important that they should not be led to think that there is happening something of which they are not properly informed.<lb/>
In this House, and in Parliament generally, we must recognise that bodies such as the bureaux are necessary. We approve statutory instruments and pass them on to the general public, many of whom have the utmost difficulty in understanding what we have done. They quite naturally turn to the CABs and ask, "Can you tell us what Parliament really means by these things?" This reflects our failure to make statutory instruments and regulations much clearer and simpler.<lb/>
I often wonder why on that remarkable television programme "Mastermind&#x2014;I think it is broadcast on
<col>162</col>
a Sunday evening&#x2014;a contestant does not take as his special subject the welfare services of this country. It is quite possible that no one feels brave enough to answer all the questions which might arise under that heading. But I would invite Mr. Magnus Magnusson to try to encourage someone to take the welfare services as a special subject, since it would be of very great interest to an extremely large number of people.<lb/>
There is only one other point that I should like to raise. It is whether the Scottish association that is said to be independent should not receive its grant directly from the Department of Trade instead of through the NACAB. I would have thought that it would benefit the Department of Trade to deal directly with the Scottish association that is after all located 400 miles from London. It is generally found more effective and useful that voluntary organisations should be firmly based in Scotland where they can be approached and have a very much better understanding of the nature of the problem. I am confident that the noble Lord will clear up these matters, but I hope that he will bear in mind the last question that I have mentioned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00629">9.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00630"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to thank the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for leaving this Question on the Order Paper, not out of politeness but because I feel that it is necessary for us to have this opportunity to discuss in a calm atmosphere the problem that has arisen and that concerns a great many people. I am particularly glad that the Secretary of State is here tonight so that we can know his opinion on these most unfortunate happenings.<lb/>
Having said that, I want to approach the matter from a different angle, especially as the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, is present. Noting what the Minister for Consumer Affairs said in another place on 22nd April, I wish to ask what on earth we are discussing tonight and what all the fuss is about. When one considers what the Minister stated, these questions must be asked. He said at column 580:
<quote>"The Government have consistently said that they admire the CABs. We respect and value the work that they do. Together with NACAB, they carry out an important national and local job. As I have said before, they provide a fine example of volunteers from all walks of life working with professionals for the good of the community. We respect, admire and support that".</quote>
Speaking of the increase in Government grant, the Minister went on to say:
<quote>"that is surely a measure of the confidence that we have in the movement. It reflects our considered view that the citizens advice bureaux provide an essential and a highly cost-effective service of general and consumer advice at a time when it is desperately needed".</quote>
In view of those remarks I am not sure whether one should use the word "obviously" or "apparently", but the comments that I have quoted can mean only one thing; namely, that the Government feel about the CABs exactly as we do&#x2014;all of us&#x2014;and that is that they perform a first-class and much-needed service.<lb/>
Moving on from the question of what the fuss is all about, I should like to ask a second question. How and why did all this arise? It is a question that should be asked. The Minister said:
<quote>"The origin of the recent controversy is both interesting and important. It came in an article in the <i>The Sunday Times.</i> Unfortunately, it appeared without any contact with me and was incorrect"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> Commons; 22/4/83, col. 580.].</quote>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0090"/>
<col>163</col>
I believe that <i>The Sunday Times</i> has some responsibility for its article of 10th April, which I have with me. Its leader of 24th April stated that Dr. Vaughan,
<quote>"gave a tendentious account of the original report of this affair in <i>The Sunday Times".</i></quote>
Tendentious or not, we shall not get far by pursuing that aspect, but we all realise the power of the press.<lb/>
Before leaving this point of interpretation, one detail did strike me and I think it is a reasonably good example. In its leader of 12th April, the <i>Guardian</i> said:
<quote>"About two weeks ago, Dr. Vaughan told the Association that he was withholding its grant for the second half of the coming financial year until he had satisfied himself that various 'problems' had been resolved";</quote>
whereas <i>The Sunday Times</i> on 10th April said that Dr. Vaughan had written to the NACAB on 23rd March,
<quote>"telling them that they will receive a grant of &#x00A3;3 million for the current financial year, compared with &#x00A3;6 million last year".</quote>
Those interpretations are not the same, and I think that we should conclude this section by noting that on 25th April, at column 588, the Minister said:
<quote>"My Department did not confirm what appeared in the article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> and no contact was made with me".</quote>
Hence, I feel that Dr. Vaughan may have some cause for complaint about media interpretation, but&#x2014;and it is a big "but"&#x2014;why did he start the whole affair? And why has there been such a mounting reaction? I do believe that, at best, the Minister has been extraordinarily inept, and the more the recriminations levelled at him the more this ineptness has been evident. There is just no answer when you, personally, have reached this stage.<lb/>
But why has there been such a mounting reaction? The answer, of course, is a spontaneous tribute to the Citizens Advice Bureaux. We all think so highly of them and of what they do that such implications produce amazement, disbelief and anger. Most people would accept that the question of Government funding is of fundamental importance. The current annual grant allocation to the NACAB of up to &#x00A3;6&#x00B7;04 million is higher than for the previous year. As we all know, of course, that money does not go directly to the local bureaux, which receive some &#x00A3;10 million from local authorities; the Government grant goes to NACAB, the central body, and is used to finance a range of support services for all bureaux. Obviously the Minister has a responsibility to ensure that the funds are used in the best interests of the service. That, I am sure, is the attitude of the NACAB.<lb/>
But it has been handled in such a "ham-fisted" way (I could not find a better adjective to describe it). Here at Westminster, in both Houses, Members are always prepared to accept from anyone, Minister or Back-Bencher, that an error has been made when this is admitted. The fault may have been ineptness; it may have been that of the media; certainly it has not been that of the CABs.<lb/>
I should like to revert to the Statement made in our House on 17th April and to two points which I made, because I would appreciate the Minister's comments. On the point of financial management and the calling in of management consultants, I was under the impression that a representative of the Minister concerned
<col>164</col>
sits on the national committee and on the council of the NACAB. I should like to ask: had they expressed concern? However, as we have the management consultants, it is important&#x2014;most important&#x2014;that the third member of the committee, as yet unannounced, be someone from the voluntary services movement. The Citizens Advice Bureaux give a service of incalculable human value to people who would not know where else to go for the type of advice that they need. I hope that the report to be made will recognise and support their excellence.<lb/>
I do not know how many of your Lordships saw in <i>The Times</i> on Saturday 30th April an article on pensions. It was headed:
<quote>"How to take problems out of the biggest investment in your life".</quote>
I should like to quote two paragraphs from it, because I think that they are important perhaps as regards what the Minister will say in his reply. It is speaking of the Occupational Pensions Advisory Services, which it then calls "OPAS". It goes on to say:
<quote>"OPAS is trying for charitable status, and will probably be partially funded by the pensions industry. It is linking up with the Citizens Advice Bureau to provide a pensions information service at CAB's 850 branches, backed by a panel of local, and central pensions experts &#x2026;</quote>
<quote>"CAB workers, 90 per cent. of whom are voluntary, will be trained to deal with pensions queries: hence the two month gap before the service starts."</quote>
I am citing that, in case the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, has not seen it&#x2014;he may have done&#x2014;in order to emphasise the type of problem that comes to the CAB. I am very much hoping what I know the two previous speakers have already hoped, that in the reply that the Minister will give us tonight, out of this most unhappy episode may come further tributes to the work of the Citizens Advice Bureaux and what they do.<lb/>
In conclusion, I should like once more to pay tribute to the National Consumer Council. I hope that their report, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, and published last Monday, entitled <i>Information and Advice Services in the United Kingdom,</i> will have a wide circulation. Indeed, the report is made to the Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Dr. Vaughan.<lb/>
Those of us from all sides of the political spectrum who have supported the voluntary advice system over many years know full well that the National Consumer Council is correct when it says that in some areas no public money is available for advice centres, such as the Citizens Advice Bureaux, while in others central and local government set up competing services. Problems of today have led to increased demands on advice centres, and during 1981&#2013;82 the inquiries dealt with by the Citizens Advice Bureaux rose by a tenth, to nearly 5 million. I want to emphasise, as I am sure all past Members of another place and those of us interested in the social services will confirm, that people who come to Members of Parliament on this type of problem and people who go to the Citizens Advice Bureaux on this type of problem really do regard both those sources as sources of a last resort. They do not know where they would go for help if they did not go there, and I think that that cannot be overemphasised.<lb/>
I believe that whatever sort of Government we get as a result of the general election, there is a job that must
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0091"/>
<col>165</col>
be done. I quote from the report of the National Consumer Council:
<quote>"Central Government departments still have no common policy towards information and advice services. It is still extremely rare to find any coherent strategy at local government level".</quote>
If that statement is correct&#x2014;and, knowing the source, I think it is&#x2014;I am pinning great faith on the belief that the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, will think that something must be done about this. It is certainly a job which the political party to which I belong would regard as necessary and I believe that that would apply to any party in either the House of Commons or the House of Lords. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, will be able to reassure us on those matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00631">9.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00632"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened with great interest to the points that have been made, and in due course I should like to reply on one point in particular. This has been a good debate and this matter is of a kind which we in this House are, I believe, very well placed to tackle. Despite all the excitement of recent weeks, it is not a party political issue&#x2014;as the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, said&#x2014;any more than the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux is a political organisation. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, pointed out, it raises some very important general questions on Government relations with grant-aided organisations, and I think that we must consider those.<lb/>
I have attempted some rapid research on this matter of Government grant-in-aid funding and I am surprised how little information there is readily available. There are the somewhat obscure statements in the Treasury handbook, <i>Government Accounting,</i> that:
<quote>"a grant in aid reflects Parliament's agreement to surrender in some degree its control over the spending of the monies it has granted";</quote>
and that Government departments providing grants-in-aid should aim to ensure,
<quote>"prudent management",</quote>
of the money,
<quote>"from the point of view of the taxpayer, while leaving a reasonable degree of freedom to the bodies concerned".</quote>
In addition, there is the Management and Personnel Office's Guide on Non-Departmental Public Bodies, which contains some useful general principles on Government policy in this part of the area. There are some grant-aided organisations&#x2014;and the NACAB is one&#x2014;which do not seem to fit the guide's own definition of what is a non-departmental public body.<lb/>
Neither of these publications has much to say about the underlying issue: how can Government ensure that public funds are effectively and properly used, while leaving an appropriate degree of independence to the organisations concerned? I am not the only one to ask this question. The noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, has referred to the letter from the chairman of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, and he raised many of these points. I agree that efficiency and propriety are essential conditions which any Government must satisfy themselves are met in the use of the funds they provide. As to the need for efficient use of the grant money, there can be no room for argument. It is fundamental that taxpayers' money must be
<col>166</col>
economically and effectively used. That is the principle which the Government&#x2014;and I applaud them for it&#x2014;have done much to bring home in the citadels of Whitehall where rigorous disciplines have been imposed. Have they been equally rigorous, I wonder, in considering grant-aided bodies?<lb/>
These bodies are as dependent on the taxpayer as any part of Government itself, yet they claim&#x2014;and are accorded&#x2014;substantial independence in determining their spending priorities and aims. In the particular case of the NACAB there is, as we all know, to be a wide-ranging independent review of cost-effectiveness, and I warmly welcome this. As has already been mentioned in the debate, the NACAB themselves welcome this, and the point has been made that they are more than happy. I enjoyed that the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley&#x2014;and I felt that it was a typical comment to come from those Liberal Benches&#x2014;thought that because people were more than happy he was suspicious of it, but that is just a sidelight.<lb/>
The second condition&#x2014;propriety in the use of public funds&#x2014;looks entirely straightforward, but in reality it raises some complex issues of principle and practice. We all agree&#x2014;and again this was mentioned in the opening speech&#x2014;that grant-aided organisations should not campaign politically in the party political sense, and they should not overtly associate themselves with any particular political party.<lb/>
However, it would not be right to say that grant-aided bodies should be precluded from commenting on matters of public interest and concern merely because a few people might regard the views expressed as political. The definition of political is the important thing. Politics come into everyday life all the time, but there is a vast difference between that concept of politics and the overt party political activity and even campaigning. CABs are there to help people to know and obtain their rights. That is their prime purpose. But the general issue here affects a wide range of grant-aided bodies.<lb/>
The work of the CABs involves the interests of a legion of departments: the Department of Trade; the DHSS; the Home Office; the Department of the Environment; the Inland Revenue for tax problems; and even the Lord Chancellor's Department for legal aid and related questions. All of these departments are interested in the work because the work is directly related to the legislation for which they are responsible.<lb/>
Public debate and mentions in the press seem to have generally confused the issue of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and the local offices where the public go for advice, and indeed here tonight we have all talked about both national and local offices. They seem to be so inextricably linked that we have to deal in a way with both. The National Association is the body mentioned in the noble Lord's Question.<lb/>
But I should like to take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, about the local bureaux and the funding from local authorities. I should mention that the greatest workload in terms of new and repeat inquiries, according to the report of the NACAB, is in London where the four areas handle
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0092"/>
<col>167</col>
21.4 per cent. of the total CAB workload, whereas the Midlands, the East and the West handle about 14.8 per cent. At the other end of the scale, the smallest percentage of cases is in Devon and Cornwall at 2.4 per cent. To me, that difference is particularly interesting as my local government and other political experience has been in both places. My local government experience was in London, but I was a parliamentary candidate in Cornwall. Thus, I have seen the difference in these areas. The NACAB figures typify these differences.<lb/>
I understand that in most of the large cities the voluntary element within the local CABs has almost gone. The staff are almost entirely fully paid. Since the 1976 decision by the London borough of Hackney to regrade all the staff in line with local authorities' related pay scales, pressure has built up in London and in almost all areas staff are now paid full local authority rates.<lb/>
This has resulted in the fact that, although local authorities may choose to give a sum of money to the Citizens Advice Bureaux, the bureaux may say that that is not enough and in most areas in London they have cut back their service. The City of Westminster last year gave a grant of over &#x00A3;155,000 for the four CABs in the borough, plus the premises, which cost a further &#x00A3;35,900. In applying for the local authority grant that year, the Greater London CAB area office, which comes between the national and the local, asked for an estimated &#x00A3;44,000 extra to regrade the bureaux staff. On the other hand, the council took the view that it could manage to increase the grant only in line with inflation&#x2014;10 per cent.&#x2014;and the council committee made clear that it did not mind what the Greater London CAB did, provided it did it within its own budget.<lb/>
Perhaps I should point out that the council also funds two law centres and an immigrant employment bureau, and all of these work closely with the Citizens Advice Bureaux, and that is another quite large amount of money for the local authority to find. In grant-aiding voluntary organisations the local authority intends to provide a needed service for ratepayers. Here I should point out to the noble Baroness, Lady Burton of Coventry, when she says what the local authority should or should not do, that a local authority is actually empowered to give grants but is not obliged to give them. It is its choice where it decides money should be spent.<lb/>
The addition of the direct personal and voluntary effort which we see in the rural areas is a most interesting point. It is highly relevant to the debate and the controversy that has arisen over this issue. In London, as chairman of the social services committee, I have had a considerable number of complaints over the years about the operation of local bureaux. In rural areas people are rightly proud of the marvellous volunteer service. The same applies to Meals on Wheels. It applies through the whole structure of social services. In the big cities we have lost the voluntary element and the community spirit of the rural areas. I only wish we could reproduce this in London and retain those very valuable elements.<lb/>
The problem in London is that the local authorities are concerned about duplication of effort and the
<col>168</col>
double expenditure of money involved. Looking briefly through that local authority's budget, I saw that it was giving a further &#x00A3;220,000 to bodies exactly duplicating the work of the Citizens Advice Bureaux.<lb/>
When I was a chairman of the social services committee, I had complaints about the local Citizens Advice Bureau from both sides. One group of people would say to me, "They are not trendy enough for us. It is not relaxed and informal enough. When you go in, they do not let you have a cup of tea and just sit down". The other side will say that they are too trendy. It is extremely difficult to produce a service that satisfies all sectors of your community.<lb/>
I think that the CABs do a marvellous job and I am not complaining about that. Where my surgery is now&#x2014;that is, in Islington, that borough that flies the red flag over the council chamber&#x2014;I am shocked to see that at the moment this service has been cut right back. On Mondays, they open from 1.30 to 4.0; Tuesdays, from 3 to 6; Wednesdays, 1.30 to 4.30; Thursdays, 12 to 2; and Fridays 10 to 12.30.<lb/>
I am sure that the noble Lord, having been in medical practice (and I am a dental practitioner) will know that the one thing that is essential in life is to have regular hours. It does not matter what time you are there, but if you are there at the same time every day, patients will get to know about it and will come. I hear all the time from my patients that they go along there and it is closed. That is no service for people. There is a need for much to be done. I think there may be complaints sometimes with political motivations but those are not the complaints that I have had. The complaints I have had are complaints about the service. I think that there is a vast difference between "outside London" and "in London". I think that anything that can be done to encourage the voluntary sector to continue would be wonderful; and I am sure that this largely could be done nationally.<lb/>
The only point that I feel that I must draw to the attention of the Minister&#x2014;because it concerns me greatly&#x2014;is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, in his opening speech. He asked the Minister to direct local government on what action they should take in relation to local citzens advice bureau. As someone who has spent considerable time in local government, I would point out that, first of all, I do not think that the Department of Trade has direct connections with local government; but secondly, local government values its autonomy and local government is elected to know the needs of local people. As in the past, those pressures occurred to create alternatives to the CAB, in a time when social services were expanding. In fact, that is what is causing the problem now. There are so many and we can no longer afford to carry them on. I would say to this House that if the Minister attempted to direct local government as to what they should or should not give to any sort of voluntary body, there would be another uproar to equal anything we have had in the past.</membercontribution></p>

As organisations carry on&#x2014;and this one has been going for many years and very successfully&#x2014;it is always good to have the opportunity to stand back and look at it. I should like to say that I am very interested that the subject was debated tonight and thank the House for listening.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00635">9.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00636"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether or not I join with other noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for leaving his Unstarred Question on the Order Paper this evening. In fact, I think that, as the Unstarred Question has been set down, the debate this evening has concentrated very much on the question of the Citizens Advice Bureaux; but the underlying question which I think Lord Winstanley wanted to draw out of the debate this evening concerned the reasons for the uncertainty about the allocation of the grant for 1983&#2013;84 to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. I think the thought that he had in mind in altering the wording of his Unstarred Question was to highlight some of the problems by way of Government grants to non-departmental public bodies or to voluntary-aided bodies which exist from time to time.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness, Lady Burton of Coventry, reminded us, we gathered something about these reasons from the articles which appeared in the Sunday newspapers before the Government's Statement of 11th April. I do not wish to dwell on the specifics of those articles, which have been refuted&#x2014;and, indeed, I do not think that any speaker has dwelt on them&#x2014;but I should like to dwell for a moment on the problems that a sponsoring Minister inevitably has with a national organisation which has autonomous branches or local units throughout the country. Some of those local units will inevitably, in their campaigning work, run foul of the susceptibilities of local politicians. For this reason it is important that there should be clarity for those who work for voluntary bodies about what their personal and public roles are in relation to that work.<lb/>
I speak tonight as a former chairman of the Greater London Citizens Advice Bureaux and also as a former chairman of the Community Projects Foundation, in both of which roles I have been involved in this problem with two different sponsoring Ministers. For example, in the Community Projects Foundation we agreed that, in order to clarify the situation, for all who worked for the Foundation there should be guidelines drawn up on the question of party political involvement. We made it quite clear that the staff of the Foundation, whatever their private political beliefs, were expected to avoid being identified in their professional role with any particular political party, and that they should not allow any personal political beliefs improperly to influence the work for which they were paid. Staff were, and are, encouraged to stimulate or induce community initiatives, but not to proceed with proposals unless there is clear and substantial support for proposals from within the community for which they are working. We hoped that these guidelines helped to solve some of the problems.<lb/>
Some problems have also been laid at the door of the Charity Commissioners. Their annual report for 1981 referred to what was regarded as "party political activity" by War on Want, and to the need to clarify exactly the nature of the activity and who carried it out.<lb/>
<col>172</col>
I think it is important for us to be slightly clearer than we have been in the past, so that everybody who works for voluntary organisations or for organisations falling within this general category should be absolutely clear as to where his or her duties lie and what should be the extent of his or her political involvement in a non-party sense. It would be helpful if this matter could be clarified, because a lot of the problems which have been raised in the case of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux seem to have arisen in particular local areas, since there was not absolute clarity as to the role of individual people working for the local advice bureaux.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Burton of Coventry, recalled the whole saga of the grant to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. What she said was absolutely accurate and I agree with her, inevitably, that this question was rather ineptly handled. I remind her that in one of our earlier debates I pointed out to the Minister who was answering for the Government that representatives from the Department of Trade attend meetings of the executive committee of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, and that they have not at any time raised at those meetings any questions about the management of the finances of the National Association.<lb/>
Another problem which this incident has highlighted is the very unsatisfactory procedure for voluntary organisations of being funded from year to year, and of not being certain what level of funding&#x2014;if any funding at all&#x2014;they are to receive in succeeding years. One would have thought that if a rolling funding operation, carried forward from year to year&#x2014;maybe, over a three-year period&#x2014;could be adopted, an organisation would be able to plan its future activities in a surer way than it can at the present time. This point is emphasised in the report from the National Consumer Council, which refers to the very unsatisfactory nature of the short-term funding of these organisations.<lb/>
The question of local authority funding was also raised. This varies very much from area to area and it does not necessarily reflect the need for advice services in certain places. I have always thought that the National Association ought, in some ways, to be able to even out some of that funding when it was not adequate. It would have been much better if the review had been set up as a routine action. It is quite normal for organisations of this type to have a periodic review by the Minister responsible, without its arising in the way in which it arose after the concern about the withholding of the half-year's grant. Without the concern, the review could have proceeded, and there was no need for the uncertainty which was created as a result of the Minister's initial action in withholding half of the year's grant. As many noble Lords have pointed out this evening, that induced a feeling of uncertainty about the work of the national association. Nevertheless, the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, felt that this was good. It showed how much the work of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux was valued, because everybody came to their aid.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0095"/>
<col>173</col>
I must I feel say a few words about the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes. She said that the Citizens Advice Bureaux service in London is now almost 100 per cent. paid service. I must confess that my information is not absolutely up to date, but until recently the position was that although it was almost 100 per cent. paid service in the Inner London area it was very largely voluntary service in the Outer London area. This was because the two services had developed in a quite different way during the last 30 or 40 years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00637"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to correct my statement and say "Inner London". The noble Lord is, I believe, correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00638"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for confirming that what I have said is correct.<lb/>
The noble Baroness referred in particular to the very generous grants made by the City of Westminster to a number of voluntary organisations within the area of the city council. I am well aware of this. However, one should remember that local authorities approach the question of how services in their areas should be run in a different way. Some local authorities like to run their services directly, whereas other local authorites like to provide these services through voluntary agencies. That is certainly the case in the City of Westminster. Not only does the City of Westminster provide funds for the Citizens Advice Bureaux; very substantial funds for Age Concern are also provided.<lb/>
A great deal of social service work is also done through a voluntary agency in the City of Westminster. As the noble Baroness said&#x2014;this was reinforced by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, in his intervention&#x2014;I do not believe that we should quarrel about the discretion given to local authorities as to how to run their services. I support the noble Baroness entirely in her statement that local authorities should not be directed and that they should have the power to do what they wish to do within their own areas. That is a sentiment which we very much support.<lb/>
I hope that this debate has been useful and has managed to bring out some of the problems which have been associated with this rather unhappy episode.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00640"><member>The Secretary of State for Trade (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, posed his Question in a speech which was both moderate and helpful. I have also listened very carefully to the contributions made by my noble friends Lord Selkirk and Lady Gardner of Parkes, and also to the contributions made by the noble Baroness, Lady Burton of Coventry, and the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede. May I assure all of them that what they have said will be most carefully considered and will be brought to the attention of the independent review team under the chairmanship of Sir Douglas Lovelock. The one golden thread that has run through
<col>174</col>
the whole of this evening's debate has been the high regard in which the Citizens Advice Bureaux are universally held. I join in the tributes which have been paid to them. Some 90 per cent. of the people who work in CABs are volunteers, and this is just the kind of movement which is most valuable to the community and which I am sure we all want to encourage.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Selkirk said that we need to recognise that movements of this kind are necessary. The noble Baroness, Lady Burton of Coventry, made much the same point. We ourselves take this view, as is clearly borne out by the Government's record in this field. It is important that I should state this quite clearly. In 1979&#2013;80 the total grant amounted to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;8 million. In 1983&#2013;84 (that is, the current year) the cash limit is &#x00A3;6&#x00B7;04 million&#x2014;an increase of three and a half times in money terms and approximately double in real terms. If one goes back to 1978&#2013;79, when the total funding was &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million, the increase over the period is even more striking than the figures I have given.<lb/>
If we look at the staff employed&#x2014;and this essentially reflects the increase in the funding which has been provided&#x2014;in March 1979, the total staff, in full-time equivalents, was 151. Today the figure is 224. This is an increase of nearly 50 per cent. The head office staff has increased in the same proportion, by a figure of approximately 50 per cent. These figures illustrate the extent to which the Government have provided the funds for the development of the Citizens Advice Bureaux movement.<lb/>
May I turn from that to the question of the need for a review. As long ago as March 1981 a suggestion was made by my own department to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux that a staff inspection would be helpful. A staff inspection is not a staff cutting exercise but is designed to ensure that resources and needs are properly matched to one another. For various reasons, delay occurred, I wish to make it clear that there was no question of any delay on the part of the National Association; there were various reasons for the delay. But delay did occur and the matter was further complicated by the fact that the post of director remained vacant for some 10 months until Mrs. Filkin, the present director, was appointed on 1st February of the present year.<lb/>
The need for a review, therefore, has been common ground for some considerable time. The need for it was agreed with the National Association as well as by my own department. It is not the position&#x2014;as the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede, rather suggested&#x2014;that the review was simply set up as a result of the difficulties which arose recently. It is a subject that has been on the table for a period of approximately two years.<lb/>
The terms of the present review&#x2014;which have been agreed with the association&#x2014;go wider than the staff inspection originally contemplated.<lb/>
I think it would be as well if I reminded your Lordships of the actual terms of reference of the review. These were announced in another place on 27th April and repeated in your Lordships' House. The remit is as follows:
<quote>"To review the functioning of' the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and to make recommendations, with a
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0096"/>
<col>175</col>
view to ensuring that the Association gives the best possible service and support to local Citizens Advice Bureaux and that the monies available to the Association are spent in the most effective way".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27/4183; col. 940.]</quote>
To ensure that the questions of staffing and management structure, which were at the heart of the original proposal for a review, are examined in detail a firm of management consultants will be appointed to assist the review team and a senior member of the firm appointed will be a member of that review team. The chairman of the review is Sir Douglas Lovelock who is a First Church Estates Commissioner. He recently retired as chairman of the Board of Customs and Excise. As well as his distinguished public service career, he has a long connection with voluntary work&#x2014;particularly church work&#x2014;and I am sure that he will make an admirable chairman with both knowledge of and an association with voluntary work and a real sense of the needs of the situation.<lb/>
The review may well suggest ways in which the NACAB can improve its own efficiency and spend the money available to it to better advantage. That we must wait and see. The position therefore is that it has long been agreed that a review was needed, that the financial provision made had increased substantially over the years and, indeed, was being increased in the current year by a figure much in excess of the rate of inflation.<lb/>
There is a responsibility on Ministers to ensure that public money is properly and effectively spent. In these circumstances, having regard to the agreement that a review was necessary, to the rise in expenditure over the years and to the provision of a greater amount in the estimates for the coming year, it was perfectly reasonable at the start of the current year to delay a decision on the appropriate level of the grant for the second half of the year, pending a decision on the review of the kind which has now been agreed. It was equally right, when it became clear that the review could not now he completed before September, to confirm at once that in these circumstances funding would be maintained on the expected basis of the &#x00A3;6&#x00B7;04 million cash limit throughout the year as a whole.<lb/>
The position of local authorities was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, and also by my noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes. This is a point of importance. We have made it absolutely clear that we hope local authorities will do all they can within the constraints on public spending as a whole to maintain and, indeed, improve their support for the Citizens Advice Bureaux.<lb/>
Perhaps I may turn briefly to the question of political activities by grant-aided bodies. This question was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, and referred to in a recent letter by Mr. Peter Jay in <i>The Times</i> newspaper. There was a particularly valuable and cogent speech by my noble friend Lady Gardner on this very point. What she said illustrates the difficulties that exist in this field.<lb/>
It is one thing laying down general rules, although that is hard enough. But the interpretation of those rules in individual cases can give rise to very considerable difficulties. Indeed, much of what the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, himself said illustrated this point. A very penetrating and interesting speech was
<col>176</col>
made on this point by the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede. What he said will certainly repay careful study. But these matters go rather outside the limits of the Unstarred Question in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley.<lb/>
So far as the National Association is concerned, the association has made it clear that it will investigate any complaint of political bias or activity, and that I am sure is the right approach. The National Association is also this week reissuing and consolidating guidance to its employees and to all local bureaux on political impartiality. That will be helpful and, I am sure, will be generally welcome.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Selkirk raised two points relating specifically to Scotland. I have no doubt that the review body will in fact seek evidence from Scotland, but the staffing and management structure of the Scottish association will not be examined in detail. Quite simply, the reason is that our own staff inspectors recently completed an appraisal of that kind. I am sure my noble friend will be glad to know that it identified no major problems. My noble friend also raised the question whether it might not be desirable for the Scottish bureaux, or the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, to receive a grant direct from the Department of Trade. We shall certainly consider this proposal sympathetically, and we are in touch with SACAB about this. Perhaps we might proceed with those discussions with them.<lb/>
Finally, may I say this. The position is that an independent review is now to be carried out on a basis which has been fully agreed with the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. The right course, I am sure, is to allow that review to proceed and for anybody who wishes to make a point of view known to make it to the review team, who will no doubt give it careful consideration. The review team will work closely with the National Association and the report will be available to them once we have received it. The report will be published: and this will give us all the opportunity of considering these matters in the light of the findings and recommendations of the review team.</membercontribution></p>

He will remember that I asked him that question.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00646">Whether local authorities using commercial kennels for the temporary housing and eventual disposal of stray dogs make it a condition of the contract that Section 3(5) of the Dogs Act 1906 (which prohibits the sale of stray dogs for vivisection) shall be strictly observed.</p>

Any evidence of possible contraventions of that provision ought to be drawn to the attention of the local police.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00650"><member>Lord Elton</member>: Unless the prisoner is under 21, it is for him to notify his family of his transfer, and he will if necessary be allowed a letter at public expense to enable him to do so. Prisoners are normally told of their moves in advance, but we recognise that difficulties can arise for some unconvicted prisoners who may have to be moved at short notice and for prisoners in the highest security category whose transfers cannot be disclosed in advance. If a prisoner has been unable to notify his family before a transfer and it is known that a visit may be planned, prison governors try to prevent a wasted journey but occasionally they may not be successful.</p>

<title>Air Transport Tariffs: Enforcement</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00669"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00670">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00671">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they accept the recommendation of the International Civil Aviation Organisation that organisations issuing licences have an important obligation to see that the terms of the licences are carried out; and whether they will make a statement clarifying the position of the Department of Trade and the Civil Aviation Authority on this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00672"><member>The Secretary of State for Trade (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Her Majesty's Government accepted the recommendations on tariff enforcement which were adopted at the Special Air Transport Conference in Montreal in April 1977 and the Second Air Transport Conference held there in February 1980. The policies of the Department of Trade and of the Civil Aviation Authority are consistent with this position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00673"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could the Minister go a little further than that? Although I am glad that the Government accept the recommendations made at both those conferences, does it mean that the Government, the Department of Trade and the Civil Aviation Authority will check that this clause is held to by those holding the licences?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00674"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is one thing making the rules and the regulations, which is what we have in fact done. It is much more difficult ensuring that the rules are obeyed. The chief offenders in this respect are the airlines themselves. We are doing everything we can to persuade them to forsake the sin that does so easily beset them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00675"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, but does the Minister understand&#x2014;I am sure he does&#x2014;that the airlines themselves would welcome the Department of Trade seeing that this clause is adhered to? Does he recall that last Thursday in this House he did say that the operating permits we are discussing now make it clear that the approved fares must be charged? Will the Government see if they can help in that matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00676"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. As I have said on a number of occasions in the past, we are taking every
<col>182</col>
measure we can to ensure that the airlines comply with their obligations, but it must necessarily be done primarily by persuasion, because many of the airlines of course are foreign airlines and they are backed by foreign Governments. If we were to take too vigorous action in this country, it would almost certainly lead to retaliation against our own airlines.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00677"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to persist, because I am sure the Minister wishes to help. But, while we in this House think he is a very firm Minister and will stand by what he says, does he not feel that some pressure should be brought to hear on airlines (if there are any) which persistently break the clause which the Minister himself has now inserted in these permits?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00678"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. We have in fact taken action by way of persuading airlines, where that remains the only course open to us. But it is impossible, I fear, to solve this problem completely so long as there remains a large amount of surplus capacity in the airline business. But, as the noble Baroness knows, agreement has been reached on a number of important routes to ensure compliance with the published and approved fares. That is progress, and we will continue to do our best to ensure that progress is maintained.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Leaded Petrol: Future Availability</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00679">3.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00680"><member>Lord Montagu of Beaulieu</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00681">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00682">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they appreciate the necessity of having leaded petrol available after 1990 for use by vehicles constructed previously, the modification of whose engines to use unleaded fuel would be impossible or impractical.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00683"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government fully accept that when lead-free petrol is introduced transitional arrangements will be needed for a number of years to ensure that leaded petrol continues to be available for vehicles that need it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00684"><member>Lord Montagu of Beaulieu</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Is he aware that what he has said will be of considerable comfort to the owners of the more exotic and historic vehicles, such as vintage Bentleys and so on, the continuing use of which gives immense pleasure to the general public?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00685"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for those remarks. I am equally glad that we are able to give that comfort to those owners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00686"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do the Government accept the view of the Royal Commission that so long as there is a demand for leaded petrol there is no reason at all why it should not be supplied? Will the Government, in their various consultations, be having talks with the motoring organisations on this
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0100"/>
<col>183</col>
important point which has been raised by the noble Lord? Finally, as everything will depend upon negotiations with the EEC, will the Government keep Parliament informed of progress in this direction in case things should not be going satisfactorily?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00687"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, that full consultation with all the interested parties in the United Kingdom&#x2014;the oil industry, the motor industry and, indeed, the users&#x2014;will be undertaken. I am quite sure he will accept that these consultations may take some little while to resolve, as there are a number of problems. So far as the EEC is concerned, noble Lords may like to know that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment will be discussing this matter with colleagues at the council meeting in Europe next month, in June.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00688"><member>Lord Mowbray and Stourton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, am I right in thinking that Her Majesty's Government are ordering that by 1985 the lead content in petrol for all new cars should be down from 0.4 grammes per litre to 0.15? Can my noble friend give me some indication of the percentage of lead reduction that is?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00689"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is quite right. It was in 1981 that the Government recognised the problems associated with lead in petrol and made arrangements for the level to be reduced from 0.4 grammes per litre to 0.15 in 1985. This will be a 60 per cent. reduction in the lead content in petrol, and will make the most significant difference to the whole problem of leaded petrol. The move towards lead-free petrol, I am quite sure it will be realised by all noble Lords, will therefore be of a very much smaller denomination.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00690"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while we are talking about petrol, may I ask the Minister whether he is aware that at many garages announcements on the pumps say that the petrol is so much per litre? Can we please have the announcements on these pumps in gallons?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00691"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the price of petrol is somewhat wide of the Question on the Order Paper, but certainly there has been a move during the last few years to adopt the litre system. But if one looks very carefully one will see, certainly at all the garages and filling stations with which I have been associated over a number of years and have knowledge of today, that there is a chart on the side of the pump giving the equivalent rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00692"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister give some thought to the need to keep the cost of petrol down, especially if there are any changes in the lead content? I think he will recall that exactly four years ago today, at the last general election, petrol could be bought for about 93p per gallon&#x2014;and that price has now almost doubled. If the present trend continues, and if the present Government stay in office, the cost of cars and motoring will be such that the only vehicles to be seen will be in motor museums.</membercontribution></p>
<col>184</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00693"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first. I have little doubt but that the present Government will remain in power. So far as the cost is concerned, noble Lords will recall that lead-free petrol was shown to be somewhat more costly. If people wish to have all the environmental benefits of lead-free petrol, they must recognise that they have to be paid for. In Chapter 7 of its report, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution sets out all the costs associated with this move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00694"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend not agree that the rise in the price of petrol has nothing whatever to do with Government policy? It is entirely due to the increasing surplus of refining capacity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00695"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure that I have any note about the surplus of refining capacity, but certainly the cost of petrol at our pumps results from a wide variety of factors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00696"><member>Lord Hankey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Government tell the House whether any encouragement is being given to industrial and chemical research with a view to producing a substitute for lead which will maintain the octane level in petrol without being equally damaging to the health of the population?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00697"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, research has been going on for a number of years, and there are a number of alternatives to lead. One is methanol, and another is MTBE. These are both produced in small quantities, largely on the continent. They are very expensive, but they could certainly provide an alternative additive to increase the octane rating.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00698"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the best answer that he can give my noble friend Lord Bishopston is quite simple: get on your bike?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00699"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the cost of petrol in this country, which has its own oil resources&#x2014;as we understand it, quite ample resources&#x2014;is very much higher than it is in some countries which do not have any oil at all of their own? Can he explain how his Government have managed to arrange that for us?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00700"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord cares to put down a specific Question on the Order Paper, I shall be delighted to give him what answer I can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00701"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord investigate the whole question of the cost of additives to petrol to be used in substitution for lead, to which he referred in answer to another noble Lord? My information is that there are additives which do not add significantly to the cost of the fuel itself. Will he undertake to investigate that a little further?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00702"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite happy to give the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, an assurance that I shall look at that point. He uses the word "significant", and I would point out

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00710"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00711">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00712">To ask Her Majesty's Government how many non-industrial civil servants are now engaged full-time on trade union activities, and what is the estimated cost to the Exchequer of their incomes, accommodation, telephones, typewriters. <i>et cetera.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00713"><member>The Lord Privy Seal (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret that central figures are not available at present, but are due to be collected in the summer in order to monitor the effects of the new national framework agreement on facilities introduced in 1982. I gave the last available figures in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, on 1lth March 1982.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00714"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not the expense involved in employing these civil servants entirely on trade union duties quite considerable, and should the cost to the Exchequer still be justified when the unions can now well afford to bear it?</membercontribution></p>
<col>186</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00715"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the first part of the noble Lord's supplementary question, I should like to make it quite clear that the greater part of time off is for industrial relations duties, and not in fact trade union activities. But I should also say that the new national framework agreement provides for greater control of facility time through increased accountability for individuals' time off, and through provision for a review at least annually of the facility time allowances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00716"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00717"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Leader of the House whether it is not the case that in Civil Service departments highly paid, full-time officers are engaged in watching worker relationships, and should not the workers themselves have the same right to representation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00718"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, has made an allegation about what might be going on in Civil Service departments on which I would rather not comment. The object of this particular exercise is to negotiate not only the new national framework agreement, as has been agreed, but also agreements within departments, and this is intended to encourage both responsible activities of trade unions and responsible debate on industrial relations matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00719"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Baroness confirm that she is satisfied with the state of industrial relations in the Civil Service at the present time, and does she agree that the national facilities agreement will assist towards improving industrial relations in the Civil Service? Does she also agree that the amount of money spent is negligible and is well worth it in terms of achieving good industrial relations in the Civil Service?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00720"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that industrial relations in the Civil Service are good. The national framework agreement has been agreed. It is now being discussed with departments. Over 60 per cent. of non-industrial civil servants have now reached agreements with departments, and, as I indicated in my original Answer, we expect the rest to be completed later on in the summer.<lb/>
So far as the expense is concerned, this was the point of the Question that was asked originally by my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, and I stated the sums of money involved. However, in answering today's Question, I should like to make it clear that the paid time off allowed to union representatives for trade union activities is strictly limited, and that, under employment legislation, employers are required to allow reasonable time off for trade union activities.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Agricultural Holdings (Amendment)<lb/> (Scotland) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00726">3.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00727"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (The Earl of Mansfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to introduce changes in the law governing the relationship between agricultural landlords and tenants in Scotland; changes affecting the procedure for determining rent in rent review cases which go to arbitration and the arrangements for succession on the death of a tenant. The House may find it helpful if I briefly describe the background to the Bill.<lb/>
As your Lordships may be aware, there has been a gradual decline over a considerable period of time in the number of farms available to let. This decline was noted by the committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Northfield, which reported in 1979 on its inquiry into the acquisition and occupancy of agricultural land. I should like to pay tribute to the noble Lord for his personal contribution to that far-reaching inquiry. I am sure that the majority of noble Lords here will agree with the view of the Northfield Committee that there is a good case for retaining and encouraging a healthy and reasonably large let sector.<lb/>
In Scotland over the past 10 years, the percentage of total area of agricultural land held under the traditional landlord/tenant system has dropped from 36 to 31 per cent. Both sides of the industry in Scotland, the Scottish Landowners' Federation and the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, were of course aware of, and concerned about, this decline, and with every encouragement from this Government and at my instigation they entered into discussions
<col>188</col>
with a view to considering what action might be taken which would be acceptable to both sides of the industry.<lb/>
These detailed discussions led to agreed joint proposals presented to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State in February 1981. Clearly provisions for succession to tenancies and arrangements for determining rent levels on arbitration are sensitive issues in which there are differing views relative to landlords' and tenants' interest. The fact that joint proposals in this sensitive field were agreed by both sides of the industry is a measure of the responsible and statesmanlike way in which they approached the exercise and I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the union and the federation for the spirit of co-operation in which they carried out this difficult task.<lb/>
On receipt of the joint proposals, which I of course welcomed, I immediately met both sides of the industry and set up a working party under the chairmanship of my department with a remit to examine and establish the precise intention of the proposals on rent and succession with a view to translating these into amending legislation. The working party, which included representatives of both sides of the industry, met on six occasions and reported at the end of 1981 when there followed a round of consultations on the report with a wide range of interested bodies in Scotland. Comments on the recommendations were discussed at a meeting of the reconvened working party in June 1982 when final agreement was reached with both sides of the industry on the legislative changes necessary to implement the intentions of the joint proposals.<lb/>
I now turn to the Bill. The legislative changes affecting rent and succession are provided for by way of amendments to the provisions in the principal Act, the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949, and the clauses of the Bill follow the order of sections in the 1949 Act.<lb/>
Clauses 2 and 5 deal with the determination of farm rents on arbitration. Under existing legislation, the criterion for determining rent on review by arbitration set out in Section 7 of the 1949 Act, as amended by Section 2 of the Agriculture Act 1958, is the level of rent a particular holding would be likely to attract if available to let in the open market and the means of establishing what that level might be in comparison with similar holdings which have actually been let in the open market. For a variety of reasons, very few farms are now offered to let in the open market and, accordingly, there are situations in which rent offered may be unrealistically high because a particular would-he tenant is prepared, for one reason or another, to offer an abnormally high rent, possibly even including an element of "key money" to secure the holding.<lb/>
It is considered appropriate to modify the existing statutory formula to allow arbiters, where appropriate, to take into account other factors than open market rents to correct for any element of "key money" in the open market comparable. Clause 2 therefore provides that while normally the criterion for determining rent on review will remain as at present&#x2014;that is, comparison with the open market&#x2014;in future, an arbiter who considers that the available evidence
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0103"/>
<col>189</col>
about a comparable open market rent is insufficient or insufficiently reliable to enable him to determine the review rent on straight comparison, shall be able to take into account other factors defined in the new subsection (1A) to Section 7 of the 1949 Act introduced by Clause 2&#x2014;factors which as already explained will enable him to discount any element of "key money" in the open market evidence.<lb/>
The new factors are fourfold: first, open market comparisons outwith the surrounding area; secondly, entire range of offers made for comparable subjects; thirdly, sitting tenants' rents fixed by agreement for comparable subject in the surrounding area; and fourthly, current economic conditions in the relevant sector of agriculture.<lb/>
Clause 2 also reduces the period between rent reviews from five to three years. At this stage I should explain that during the course of the proceedings of this Bill in another place, concern was expressed to me by both sides of the industry that Clause 2 of the Bill, as drafted, might not achieve one of the main aims of the Bill, namely, that in rent review cases, an arbiter should have regard to factors additional to open market rents in the surrounding area where these rents were unrealistically high because of scarcity of subjects to let. Similar concern lay behind an Opposition amendment to Clause 2 at the Report stage in another place.<lb/>
It has always been the Government's intention in this Bill to provide that the arbiter must look to factors other than evidence of open market rents for comparable subjects in the surrounding area where he is of the view that such evidence as there is is "insufficient or unreliable" and it was envisaged that this phrase would encompass situations in which there was a scarcity of subjects to let. We acknowledge, however, that it is vitally important to ensure that the wording of the proposed new statutory formula for determining rent on rent reviews by arbitration is the correct one since this formula will affect the whole of the let sector in Scotland.<lb/>
In the circumstances the Government gave an undertaking at the Report stage in another place to re-examine the wording in detail and, if necessary, to present an amendment for the consideration of your Lordships at the Committee stage in this House. Our re-examination of the wording is in hand and I shall report the outcome to the House when it is in Committee on the Bill.<lb/>
Under existing legislation in rent review cases, there is no right of appeal by either party against an arbiter's findings of fact, or against the level of rent he finally determines, although there is an appeal on questions of law. An arbiter's decision in any particular case can be of vital importance to the livelihood of a tenant or, indeed, a landlord, particularly since rents can now involve considerable sums of' money. In present circumstances, we consider it appropriate that the important question of level of rent should be subject to review. Clause 5 of the Bill therefore provides for a right of appeal by either party to the Scottish Land Court, on questions of law or fact, against an arbiter's award in a statutory rent review case, and associated with this a provision that the arbiter shall be required
<col>190</col>
to explain in writing the reasoning behind his decision. The clause also details procedural requirements as regards the arbiter's award and arrangements for appeals.<lb/>
The provisions in the Bill relating to succession to tenancies and security of tenure are contained in Clauses 3 and 4. In Scotland, as your Lordships may know, a tenancy does not automatically end on the death of a tenant and can normally be bequeathed or transferred by the executor if there is no will or if the bequest is for any reason invalid.<lb/>
The existing legislation differentiates between near relative successors and non-near relative successors. Where a non-near relative has succeeded to a tenancy on the death of a tenant, the landlord can, if he wishes, gain repossession of the holding by serving an incontestable notice to quit on the successor within certain time limits; and the existing provisions contained in Section 6(3) of the Agriculture Act 1958 are re-enacted in Clause 3 of the Bill, in a simplified form.<lb/>
Where, on the death of a tenant, the successor is a near relative, statutorily defined as a surviving spouse or child including an adopted child, that near relative successor has considerable security of tenure and the landlord can only regain possession of the holding if he can prove to the Scottish Land Court, following service of a notice to quit, that he should get repossession of the tenancy for specific reasons defined in statute. These are that the successor has neither sufficient training in agriculture nor experience in farming to farm with reasonable efficiency; that the holding is not sufficiently large to provide full-time employment for more than two men and the landlord requires it for the purposes of amalgamation; or that the successor already has an agricultural holding of his own prior to the death of the tenant. Existing tenants have an expectation that these statutory provisions will apply to their near relative successors for unlimited generations and the Government consider it appropriate that this expectation should be safeguarded in the amending legislation&#x2014;a view shared by both sides of the industry in Scotland. For tenancies let before 1st January 1984, the existing provisions shall continue to apply to future generations of near relative successors, provided of course that there is no break in that succession. Clause 4, as read with Cases 1 to 3 in Part I of Schedule 1 to the Bill, re-enacts the provisions of the existing relevant statute&#x2014;that is, Section 18 of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968&#x2014;in a simplified form.<lb/>
For existing tenancies, therefore, the statutory provisions relating to rights of succession and security of tenure remain exactly as they are under existing legislation, and the reason for re-enacting these provisions in this Bill is to bring together as a matter of convenience in one piece of legislation the main statutory provisions relating to succession to tenancies in Scotland. The relevant sections of earlier Acts are repealed.<lb/>
So far as new tenancies are concerned&#x2014;that is, tenancies created on or after 1st January 1984&#x2014;the Bill in Clause 4, as read with Cases 4 to 7 in Part II of Schedule 1 to the Bill, adjusts slightly in favour of the landlord but only in that it enables the landlord to
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0104"/>
<col>191</col>
regain possession where the tenant is clearly not suitable. Both sides of the industry&#x2014;landlords and tenants&#x2014;share this view and are agreed that the balance should be adjusted in this way in favour of the landlord by widening the grounds on which a notice to quit may be served on a near relative successor to a new tenancy. The new circumstances are set out in Cases 4 to 7 of Part II of Schedule 1 to the Bill and are briefly that a successor does not have sufficient financial resources or relevant training or experience to farm the holding with reasonable efficiency, or that the successor at the date of the notice to quit occupies other agricultural land capable of providing full-time employment for himself and at least one other man. In these cases the onus of proof before the Scottish Land Court, following the service of a notice to quit, will shift from the landlord, as at present, to the tenant. Where a notice to quit is served on the grounds that the holding is required for an amalgamation, the onus of proof will remain with the landlord as under the existing law.<lb/>
For new tenancies, therefore, the Bill does not introduce any dramatic change in security of tenure for near relative successors but adjusts the position slightly in favour of the landlord, though, I would emphasise, only so far as the continued good farming of the holding requires.<lb/>
There is no question of providing an instant solution to the problem of the decline in the let sector which has taken place over a period of time under successive Governments. We consider it important, however, to take steps towards halting this decline and encouraging the traditional landlord/ tenant system. We also consider it important that any changes in this sensitive and complex field should be acceptable to both sides of the industry, as indeed the measures in this Bill are. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00730"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we should be grateful to the Minister of State for his explanation of this Bill. It is a limited Bill. I do not agree with the Minister in another place, who said that it was an historical Bill&#x2014;unless, of course, every Bill is a piece of history. However, it is one as regards which I have an interest to declare. I think I shall be the only one without a real estate interest in the case of this particular Bill.<lb/>
The whole of Clause 1 tells us that in this Bill the principal Act is the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949. I was on the committee of that Bill. This Bill also affects the 1958 Act, and I was on the committee of that Bill, too. Then there was the 1968 Act. There, I was the author of Part III of that Act, which applied to Scotland. In fact, both of the latter two Bills which I have mentioned were United Kingdom Bills. Now we have this Bill.<lb/>
My main interest is the wellbeing of Scottish agriculture and of the agricultural population of Scotland; that is, the farmers and the whole community. There is no doubt that in my lifetime&#x2014;and this was brought out by the Northfield Committee&#x2014;the proportion of let or tenanted farms in Scotland has gone down from
<col>192</col>
about 88 per cent. to 31 per cent. By now it is probably down to about 30 per cent. The Northfield Committee suggested that in another 40 years it would be down to half of that&#x2014;probably about 16 per cent. It represents a complete change in the whole structure of landholding and farms in Scotland. Indeed, it concerned the Labour Government because it was the Labour Government that set up the Northfield Committee in 1977. I am surprised, first, that it has taken so long to get important, if limited, legislation: and, secondly, I am equally surprised that it is so limited.<lb/>
I have here the report. Your Lordships will see that it is a very considerable report with a considerable number of recommendations about which we have heard nothing but which are probably equally important to the problems that we could be discussing today. I should like the Minister to give us an indication whether there is any other legislation coming forward to be put on the statute book in relation to this.<lb/>
I almost feel that I have strayed into a not very well attended meeting of the Scottish Landowners' Federation&#x2014;and no doubt they will all be members of the NFU. Therefore, I can well understand how they got together and came to an agreement. I do not disagree with the entire balance that has been reached. It is a very astute balance, coming down, of course, on the side of the Scottish landowners. We shall probably be hearing about the Labour Party's ideas for land, which arc not related to this Bill at all and are not related entirely to the Northfield Committee. But the Northfield Committee tackled this point with a wide range of recommendations in relation to let land and land that is let in some form or another outside the agricultural holdings statutes, and even recommended that there should be a measure of state ownership of land. They mentioned particularly the Highlands. They mentioned new powers that should have been given to the Highlands and Islands Development Board. I should have loved to hear something about that in the Minister's Second Reading speech on this Bill, but we heard nothing at all, either in the other place, or here.<lb/>
We must bear in mind that security of tenure in relation to let farms in Scotland is way beyond what has ever been known in England. We have had this measure of security of tenure since at least 1923. That was hardened up in the 1949 Act, and in 1958 the Tory Government took it away, and even the "near relative"&#x2014;who, when the father died was probably looking forward to taking over a farm which had been in the family for generations and generations&#x2014;was subject to eviction; and eviction did take place. That was why in 1968, after a considerable contest with my agricultural colleagues in England&#x2014;and I see that they have both left the field&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00732"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lord Bishopston was not there in 1968. That was why in 1968 we managed partly to restore the position in Scotland. It is what is happening to that position about which I am concerned in this Bill. The Government start with the aim of trying to increase the number of
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0105"/>
<col>193</col>
let holdings in Scotland. Quite frankly, I do not think that that will work. I am very glad that they have not gone right back to the 1958 position. With the help of Norman Buchan, the Member of Parliament who was the Scottish Minister on that particular Committee, we retained that security of tenure for existing tenants. But now we have a new position. In Scotland we have two classes of tenants, with two different measures of security. In the long run I do not think that that will be for the good. I do not think that it is the kind of compromise for which everyone would have hoped and, recollecting the support that I received from the National Farmers' Union in 1968, I dare say that they would have been unhappy if they had decided to leave Scotland alone in that respect.<lb/>
But the basis of the Bill is the importance of the let sector. As the law stands, it has considerable merit in that it imports the advantage of continuity and efficiency deriving from the tradition of the son being brought up on the farm, having a detailed knowledge of it and inheriting the tenancy on his father's death. There is every incentive for the tenant's family to put the maximum skill and effort into farming the land efficiently and, as a result, everyone concerned&#x2014;the landlord, the tenant and the community at large&#x2014;benefits from the arrangements. Those are not my words; they are the words of the Government Minister in the other place. If it is as good as that, why interfere with it? But no, the bargain was made and the balance was struck.<lb/>
But I am concerned&#x2014;and I hope that the Government are concerned&#x2014;at what has been happening. I say that this will not work, that we will not get that increase. I doubt whether we shall even stem the decline in the number of let farms. When the landlord gets vacant possession, what will he do? If the present trend continues, he will take the land in hand and farm it himself as part of an estate business. He may sell it to a pension fund. That is happening in the Aberdeen area of Scotland to a greater extent than in other parts of Scotland, and the figures are all in the Northfield Committee Report. He may let it to the highest bidder, and here we come to the question of how the highest bidder gets it. There is no doubt that premiums or key money are being involved more and more in respect of this because of the scarcity of land to let. I do not say that it happens in every case, but it has been happening, and in a particular case it can inflate the rent for existing tenants.<lb/>
At present in respect of a succession to tenancy the question of training and experience in farming arises; but when the landlord lets with vacant possession, or indeed when he sells to anyone, the question of the person buying or the person who gets the let having experience does not even arise. The only question that arises is money, which gives rise to exploitation of the land. Remember, the state has a considerable interest in the land. The state has put millions and millions of pounds into the health of the land&#x2014;certainly since 1945. So we are right to examine what is being done and should not just leave it to a get-together of the National Farmers' Union and the Scottish Landowners' Federation.<lb/>
I think that the NFU was concerned about whether or not the question of key money is properly covered.
<col>194</col>
I am very grateful to the Minister for telling us that he is still examining it, although he has been examining it for some time now. I do not know when the Committee stage of the Bill will be, but it could even be next week if the Prime Minister decides to have an early election. So I ask the Minister not to dally with his consideration and to come back with the right answer, or it may well be that this Bill will be delayed. When we may be on the eve of an election, I fear that the Government will refuse amendments, because if they accept amendments, the Bill will have to go to another place, which means more time lost. But we must get it right and we must keep the bargain with the farmers.<lb/>
I should like to comment on the mood of draftsmen. Here we have a simple Bill of seven clauses. Clauses 1, 6 and 7 do not really matter. Clause 1 is the interpretation clause; Clause 6 refers to repeals; and Clause 7 tells us when the Bill will commence. The substantive clause is Clause 4. But to make any sense of the Bill you have to read Clause 2 with Clause 5, and Clauses 3 and 4 together, or Clauses 2 and 5 with the one schedule that really matters. I admire present-day draftsmen for their ability to render the simplest of Bills obscure, complex and virtually unintelligible. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Burton, will read this Bill like a book. Like me, he has been interested in this for a long time. But legislators should be given a little better guidance than they get, even from the Second Reading speech of the Minister. I defy anyone who is not concerned with this subject, and even many of those who are concerned with it, to read this Bill and understand it.<lb/>
We have the 1949 Act; we have the 1958 Act; we have the Succession (Scotland) Act, which followed from the McIntosh Report on Succession. I believe that that took about 13 years before it was put into legislative form in 1964. I was on the Committee of that Bill too. Now we have this Bill. Will there be some measure of consolidation, or have the Government decided to wait because they have something else in mind in respect of agricultural holdings? It is only fair that we give people a proper indication, so that they can read a statute through and know just exactly how they are involved.<lb/>
I turn first to rents. I disagree with the change from five years to three years. That rents must be reviewed every three years does not show a great deal of confidence in the Government's ability to keep inflation down. Of course there is only one reason for it, and that is to increase the rents. That has been their experience over a long time. If English Peers are concerned about the fact that it was five years in Scotland and three years in England, there always has been a difference between Scotland and England, in this respect. It goes way back even before the 1958 Act, and the Government did not change it in 1958 because they realised that the traditions were different there.<lb/>
Certainly there has been a speeding up in respect of inflation over recent years, but we are told now that it is going to be relatively easy; that in fact the problem has been solved. I should like to get the justification for this change from five years to three years. It is not long enough to allow any farmer to do any serious planning in respect of it. When you consider many other aspects of legislation, the Government are certainly not
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0106"/>
<col>195</col>
prepared to act when the period is longer than three years. When were valuations in Scotland last brought up to date? It is going to be about eight or nine years before they are brought up to date. They have a considerable effect. This is one of the points I shall be taking up in Committee in that respect.<lb/>
I welcome the fact that the Government are now by statute instructing arbiters where there is dispute. We should appreciate that most of the rents and rent reviews are settled by agreement between landlord and tenant. But in those cases where they are not it is unfair at the present time where there virtually is no open market, and where a farm has been let with special circumstances applying to the person who is taken over, that that should be considered adequate, as it is at present, for fixing new rents for farmers in the surrounding area, and that there is no appeal in respect of fact. When they have taken it to the land court, the arbiter is announced, be makes his decision, comes down to the place and gives his award, and the facts may be completely wrong and there are plenty of grouses on the part of the tenant, but nothing can be done outside a question of law.<lb/>
If the noble Earl likes to go to the files of the Scottish Office for the year 1978&#2013;79 he will find letters from one William Ross, MP for Kilmarnock, in respect of certain cases which took place around that particular area. A large number of farmers received letters about an increase in their rents&#x2014;astounding increases to them. That was based on a farm in the area which had changed hands for very special circumstances indeed. The adviser from the National Farmers' Union produced another farm, but the farmers were told. "No, it cannot be done. It is outside the area". I am glad in that respect that a widening range of comparisons can now be taken where there is no really open market in the immediately surrounding area.<lb/>
I remember that particular case because one of the things I was told by the farmers was that the arbiter visited when they could not see a farm: there was snow covering all the ground, and it lay there for a fortnight. The arbiter made his judgment about comparability in respect of a particular farm. But there was no appeal. I am glad now that there is an appeal in respect of facts as well as law. That is one good aspect in the Bill that I certainly applaud. I shall be happy in respect of this provision if we get that amendment which ties the matter up.<lb/>
The other point is about possession. It is not as bad as I thought it might have been. But it leaves aside all the other questions in respect of whether we should redefine the meaning of near relatives. Is the reference to the Succession (Scotland) Act of 1964, as amended, a reference to the fact that an illegitimate child was given rights in respect of inheritance? It is mentioned in Clause 4.<lb/>
When we come to the other questions affecting let farms and the decisions of landlords to let, the Government were asked by the Northfield Committee to monitor what was happening in respect of sales to overseas buyers, and that has been happening in Scotland. They were asked to monitor&#x2014;they did not wish to stop&#x2014;sales to institutions, to pension funds, and the rest of it, because many of them put in tenants rather than put in managers. Thirdly, they were asked to have a look at partnerships.<lb/>
<col>196</col>
I was impressed by a speech made in the other House by Mr. John Conic. He was subject to a partnership agreement in which he had no security at all, and one day was told that the partnership was at an end. It is a pretty phoney partnership when that happens; when one person is really being exploited by another. I know that it does not happen in all cases, but from some of the speeches we had in another place it must have angered people who entered into them in a real business and fair co-partnership sense. The Government were asked to look at these matters by the Northfield Committee. So far as I know they have done nothing. These are all important from the point of view of stopping the decline in tenant farms in Scotland.<lb/>
The other aspect that the Northfield Committee discovered was that there was scanty statistical information about the whole field. They asked for land registration. It might be embarrassing if we had complete land registration in Scotland. People would know who owned the land in Scotland, and would not leave it to the likes of Mr. McEwan in Perthshire&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00734"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Oh, he was wrong? My Lords, of course he was wrong, because some of the information was not available. Mind you, we have plenty of information that is available&#x2014;I could gladly spell it out&#x2014;covering the whole of Scotland. But should we not have more statistical information in respect of agricultural holdings? Then it may well be that we should be in a better position to legislate and to see exactly what should be done.<lb/>
The Bill is limited. The balance which has been struck is in favour of the landlord. However, I am not surprised that there is a sigh of relief among the tenant farmers that the 1968 Act was left alone so far as existing people are concerned, but it is bad that in future we are going to have two types of land holding for let land, with it being easier for the land owner now to get vacant possession.<lb/>
I do not think the Committee stage will be a long one; but it will be an important Committee stage. I hope that the Government will be able to tell us how often and how long they have looked at the Northfield Committee, and whether they have any other ideas in respect of legislation for any of their other important suggestions and recommendations.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00736"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, detailing his part in the changes which have come about. But we have got it wrong so often that I am glad that at least this new Bill is based on some form of agreement. Whatever good intentions the Labour Party had in 1949, they produced a curious situation. They produced a closed shop for farming, and produced a privileged section of tenants who hung on, and the landlords often suffered. Not that my heart bleeds much for the landlords, but they are human beings and they deserve the same consideration as other people. The landlords were done down right, left and centre by the legislation, and many tenants grew extremely rich
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0107"/>
<col>197</col>
on taking advantage of the legislation which was enacted.<lb/>
What happened to the farm servant? What happened to the fellow who used to work his way up, work a small farm and become a farmer? He had no chance; farming was left as a closed shop. Whenever the landlords had a farm in their possession, either they sold it or they took it in hand. The effect of the policy, which was supposed to be good for Scottish farming and good for the tenant farming system, has been appalling. The result is that there are vast areas affected in Scotland. For example, in Angus alone, I can show your Lordships one estate farming 4,000 acres with eight men and eight large tractors. That is the lot. There are no tenants there whatsoever. That is all because of the type of legislation we have had. It has been one-sided and has taken no account of the social considerations.<lb/>
The legislation we have in Scotland, to which the noble Lord referred, consists of long leases and the ability to bequeath the lease to anyone, not just to relatives. The beqeathing of a lease was a fair working system. If that system had been continued with some improvements, such as those over death perhaps, it would have been far better for the country as a whole than the present system and the state we are in where one has to be enormously rich&#x2014;a football pools winner or the son of a rich farmer&#x2014;before one can take over a farm. This is an unhealthy state for farming.<lb/>
I welcome the Bill. It has flaws in it as obviously all Bills have, but it does not try to reverse a decision in favour of one side or another. It tries to reach a measure of consensus and that must be good. For that reason I welcome it. I agree with the noble Lord that it is a smallish Bill, but it is an improvement. Along with it has to go a big change in the law on taxation. It must be profitable for a landlord to let a farm and good for him in the long term. It must be profitable for him to let farms in family-sized units instead of in big units. We now have to think of the life of the countryside. We are no longer like the EEC trying to amalgamate farms to get people off the land. There are 12 million people unemployed in the EEC and many of them have come off the land. We have to forget about land purely as a commercial factor and let the free play of the market work. That is not good enough; it is much more than that. We have to look carefully at any legislation if we are to encourage the traditional system, which was a good system in Scotland. It must be more profitable for the landlord and safer for him to let land than to farm it himself or to sell it. On all hands it is agreed that it is a system that can provide a ladder, and does so. If we are trying to preserve that system then I welcome the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross, implied that many people here have an interest. When he said that he looked hard at me with that piercing gaze. I admit that I have an interest in that I have been a landlord, a tenant and an owner-occupier, all three&#x2014;and sometimes at the same time. But the point about the Bill is that it is a trade-off. I welcome the rent provisions. It is extraordinary that when the market is closed for land, somebody with a scheme to grow strawberries or roses or some obscure but valuable
<col>198</col>
product will pay a lot for a farm; but if another man starts growing that product he will knock the bottom out of the market. That is typical of what has been happening. Traditional farmers have had to pay the high rents which were achieved in the open market because of the scarcity value. Then those rents were applied in arbitration to the people farming on the normal system; farming well but not the high specialist system of farming. If that were multiplied, conditions of surplus would occur which drive prices down.<lb/>
I am sorry that the old formula has been rejected (which I thought was a good one) of the rent that a prudent farmer would offer a prudent landlord, or that a prudent landlord would take from a prudent farmer. It was not a bad formula if it was allied to the open market. I was very glad to hear the Minister say that an amendment would be brought forward because the Bill as it stands does not alter this situation and it will need amendment. At present, the arbiter is bound to take the open market rent, if there is an example in the area. That will certainly have to be altered.<lb/>
The change from five years to three years will be welcome. I do not have the same optimistic view of the future of farming that some people have. I think the tenants of Scotland will be able to get their rents down every three years instead of having to wait five. I do not look to great advancing years in farming with surpluses in every part of the world. I welcome the three-yearly period. I think it will be useful and better.<lb/>
I do not think the matter of succession has done a great deal of good to the farming industry. I do not believe it has done what it was meant to do. It is all very well for the farmer's eldest son; but if the farmer has two sons&#x2014;which many farmers have, or, indeed, daughters who may wish to farm (not wishing to be sexist)&#x2014;their chances of getting a farm will be very much reduced. Nevertheless, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ross, that to have two systems will be somewhat complicated. This Bill is welcome. It is welcome more as a step in the right direction, but it is a step that I welcome.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00737">4.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00738"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to congratulate the noble Earl, Lord Mansfield, and the Government on bringing this Bill forward. Admittedly it is limited, but it deals with a subject that is highly controversial, or has been in the past. The result of the Bill will be to take much of the controversy out of the subject. I congratulate the noble Minister on the way in which he introduced the Bill, and on the Bill itself.<lb/>
I should like to say to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, that I am a member of both the National Farmers' Union and of the Scottish Landowners' Federation. I have never found that to be very controversial. Both organisations, on the whole, are fundamentally anxious that farming&#x2014;the land and the community that lives on the land and farms it&#x2014;should have every possible help and benefit. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie. I do not like these huge areas owned by companies or insurance companies unless they are prepared to let the land to people who will treat their work as part of the community and not only as something from which
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0108"/>
<col>199</col>
they hope to make a lot of money, and who do not really care very much about the areas in which they live. That is a wrong point of view, and I hope that the Bill will help in that matter and will concentrate, as it does, on the importance of both sides of the industry and of the industry itself.<lb/>
I agree that fair rents for sitting tenants are very important. I am in favour of excluding that element of premium or key money to which the noble Earl, Lord Mansfield, referred. That is a good provision, and we should support that amendment to the existing legislation.<lb/>
The second point relates to new leases to be given to successors of tenants. It is right that such people should have to prove that they are proper persons and have some agricultural knowledge. The reasons which are outlined in the Bill, although they may not be perfect, at least deal with both the landlord who has a farm to let and with the tenant who wants to remain in it or whose son or whose relations want to continue. I think that that is fair, provided that the person who succeeds is a good person, a good farmer and one who will use the land to the best advantage. I also agree that it is a good thing that in the case of a controversy the land court decision should be subject to appeal. I understand that that has not been allowed previously, and I think that it is only fair.<lb/>
I agree that the question of revising rents from five years to three years is also only fair. I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ross, who thinks that this is too short a period. Things happen quickly these days; and changes in agriculture also happen very quickly. There is a lot to be said for reducing the limit from live years to three years. It is fair to both sides. An appeal from the arbiter's decision on a point of law is also right. The working party suggested that the right of appeal to the land court on a point of fact will also go to law. I think that that, too, is fair. This would happen if the Secretary of State appointed the arbiter. If the landlord or the tenant do not want the appeals procedure, then they can agree to an arbiter.<lb/>
These are all good points, which I think will help in this very difficult subject, because there is no doubt that there has been controversy in the past. I live in an area where there are several very big, old and well-managed estates. On the whole, the tenant and the estate owner have had a very happy relationship for a good many years. I think it is important that that should be preserved. Also, I feel that it is only fair that the landlord should be able to get his property if he wants it desperately for a son or relation. This Bill, agreed as it is between both sides, between the Scottish National Farmers' Union and the Scottish Landowners' Federation, shows that there has now been an agreement which will help both sides and also the industry. I support the Bill strongly.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00740"><member>Viscount Massereene and Ferrard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to declare the usual interest regarding agriculture, in that I have tenants and I am a member of the various landowning and countryside organisations. I remember speaking on the 1968 Bill and saying that this would cause the drying up of tenancies in Scotland and that, for any young man coming out of an agricul-
<col>200</col>
tural college and wishing to become the tenant of a farm, it would be difficult to get one. I said that it would be practically impossible. And, of course, so it has proved. As the noble Lord, Lord Ross, well knows, the reason was that the then Labour Government turned farming tenants into what could almost be called a new hereditary class&#x2014;into a closed shop, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, said&#x2014;because, provided that they kept on breeding and they had therefore reasonably near relatives, they could keep on farming the farm for a thousand years, or two thousand years. There was no end to it.<lb/>
But I regret the damage which has been done to the old landlord-and-tenant farming system in Scotland, because the majority of the landowners were very good to their tenants. I remember how, in the Western Highlands in Mull, once or twice, when there had been a bad winter&#x2014;and, of course, the rents were pitiful&#x2014;my father would not take the rent at all. Now, if the state had owned that farm&#x2014;and, of' course, the state is an absentee landlord and a very ruthless one&#x2014;I am quite sure that it would have had that tenant out. But I must not dwell on that too much.<lb/>
I made a few notes while other noble Lords were speaking. I. too, welcome Clause 2, which is associated with Clause 5 regarding arbitration. I think it is an excellent idea that the arbiter will now have to put in writing his findings, the reasons he has given, for making the new rent. I understand that one can appeal against the arbiter's ruling to the Secretary of State or to the land court if one decides to use that particular route. I also understand that one does not have to abide by that but can use the old system. I should have thought that every sensible tenant and landowner, if unable to come to a private agreement, would use the new system as set forth in the Bill.<lb/>
It is really hopeless to assess new rents on comparable farms which are let on the open market. The system in the 1968 Act, which, to a certain extent, ran through the original Act, completely dried up the supply of farms available for letting on the open market. I think that I should now say that I agree wholeheartedly&#x2014;as, I am sure, do noble Lords opposite except for the noble Lord. Lord Ross&#x2014;with the reduction of the period of rent review from five years to three years. Of course, there is the question of inflation and also the question of higher and higher subsidies for farmers and, therefore, higher and higher gross profits. Therefore, I think that five years is far too long and that a fairer period in which to go to arbitration would be three years. I think it is fairer for the tenant and the landlord. True, the tenant will have to pay an increased rent, but as I have said, owing to inflation and subsidies, he will have far greater gross income.<lb/>
I have known cases where the landlord has been far poorer than the tenant. Not so long ago in the Western Highlands there were tenants who had, say, 2,000 ewes, and those tenants were paying rents which would hardly have rented a council house. They were pitifully low. Scotland is so varied in its agriculture. One can take the land south-east of Edinburgh, for example, with probably the best arable farms in the world. It is very difficult to make comparisons.<lb/>
I should also like to go for a moment on to Clauses 3 and 5 regarding successors. I am worried about one
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0109"/>
<col>201</col>
point. I am rather on the side of the tenant here; in fact I am always on the side of good tenants because it is a well tried system. But what happens if the tenant dies and he leaves a widow and a young son? I may not have read the Bill as fully as I ought to have done. It refers back to the 1949 and subsequent Acts. What happens in such a case presumably is that if the young boy wants to follow in his father's footsteps&#x2014;though, of course, not all boys do&#x2014;there ought to be some provision so that eventually he is able to do so and farm where he was brought up.<lb/>
The other point I am not quite sure about concerns adoption. That can be abused. I heard of a tenant who was paid a large sum of money to adopt a child who could eventually take over the tenancy. Apart from that, there are no doubt questions of adoption where it would be perfectly fair for the adopted child eventually to take on the tenancy.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross, made one or two remarks&#x2014;I realise that I must finish quite soon because I have been speaking for seven minutes&#x2014;and referred to state ownership. He said, quite rightly, that the state has put millions and millions of pounds into the Highlands. That is quite true; but the state has also lost millions and millions of taxpayers' money through putting that money into the Highlands, and I should like him to bear that in mind. However, I agree with the noble Lord regarding the drafting. For the ordinary layman like myself who is not a lawyer, it is gobbledegook. It is extremely complicated and it would take you a very long time, with all the previous Acts before you, to fathom it correctly. It ought to be put into far simpler English.<lb/>
I welcome the Bill and I think it will increase tenants. The fear of the noble Lord, Lord Ross&#x2014;and of course he has a point here&#x2014;is that some landlords, when they get a farm hack, will sell it to the highest bidder. Certainly some will. I would point out that what the Department of Agriculture has now done in Scotland for its own farm tenants is to allow them to buy their farms at a third under market price; and I fear that the majority of those tenants will sell their farms extremely quickly and make a very nice profit. The trouble is that they may well sell to the wrong people. I am all against these pension funds, consortia and big companies buying land in Scotland, but especially in the Highlands. I am also against foreign companies coming in&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00746"><member>Viscount Thurso</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg the noble Lord's pardon but I thought I understood him to say that there were at least two other measures which he helped to bring before another place. I may have misunderstood him and I will look carefully at <i>Hansard</i> to make sure whether I got it wrong or right. However, as I was saying, it was hard cases which produced the original legislation and destroyed a system which had worked remarkably well for a very long time. What I worry about particularly is the effect the Agricultural Holdings Act has had upon the farming ladder. It is exceedingly difficult for a young man who is not already in a farming family, or very rich, to get his foot upon the bottom rung of the farming ladder. There just are not the let farms available. The conditions which allow him to do so just are not available.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, referred to a suggestion in an excellent report by the noble Lord, Lord Northfield, that the Highlands and Islands Development Board should have more powers to help in this matter. But from recent personal experience I am not terribly encouraged in the belief that the Highlands and Islands Development Board might be able to help in this connection.<lb/>
In the summer of last year one of my tenants&#x2014;the tenant of a hill sheep farm&#x2014;gave me notice that he wished to quit at the November term on health grounds and because his daughters did not wish to succeed him in the farm. A young man whom I employed as a shepherd approached me and said that he would like to leave farm service and go into farming itself. He said he would like to embark upon the farming ladder and asked whether I would consider him as a tenant. He is an excellent young man with an excellent wife and a small family. He was an ideal person to go into this farm, but unfortunately he was not rich. Although I was prepared to temper the terms of his lease to a shorn lamb, it was almost impossible to find him finance. The Highlands Board, at first blush, said: "Yes, we will lend you money and give you grants and so forth". But they were still arguing about what they could or could not do in early November, when he was due to do an entry at the November term. Had it not been for myself, who lent him some sheep, and for the Mart, who lent him money to buy further sheep, the young man would never have got started. To place your hope in the Highlands and Islands Development Board to start young people up the farming ladder is to place your hope in a mirage.<lb/>
There is no doubt that it is the tenanted farm which can allow young people of this kind to get started; but what has happened to the tenanted farm since the original Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act? It has
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0110"/>
<col>203</col>
begun to disappear as we know it, because it just does not pay an ordinary landlord to go on owning tenanted farms. He is much better, if he gets one vacant, to sell it or to take it in hand; and so it disappears, as we have seen over the years. It is for that reason that I welcome this measure, because it will be a little more possible to enter into arrangements which will make it economic for people to go on owning tenanted farms and offering them for rent.<lb/>
I do not fear the insurance companies and the big business people&#x2014;the pensions funds&#x2014;who buy land as investments, provided that there are legislative provisions which allow them to offer it upon a sensible basis to let, because they are then doing that useful service which has always been the landlord's traditional service, which is to provide the fixed capital and allow the farmer to provide the stock and the working capital. This is the way in which the smaller farm can be financed and the way in which the smaller farm should be financed.<lb/>
I do not think that this Bill will put right overnight all the things that are wrong with the system of farm tenure in Scotland, but it is certainly moving in the right direction to correct at least some of the things that have gone wrong, and to make it possible for some of the people who ought to be in farming to be there. It is on those grounds that I, too, welcome this measure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00748"><member>Lord Stodart of Leaston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend Lady Elliot remarked at the beginning of her speech, the subject of agricultural holdings, and particularly the tenure of them, has for as long as I can remember been an extremely contentious subject in Scotland. Just mention security of tenure to me on a moonlit night, and I can hear the sound of hooves and a gentleman whom. I suspect, some noble Lords may remember by name, Captain Arthur McDougall of Blythe, galloping across Lauderdale, shouting imprecations at every landlord in sight, with the great geniality for which he was known.<lb/>
For reasons to which I shall come in a moment, I must confess that I find it hard to work myself up into a state of enormous enthusiasm for this Bill, and I shall not be in the least surprised or affronted if, in his reply, my noble friend says that I have been guilty of damning it with faint praise. I just cannot see being achieved what the National Farmers' Union of Scotland describe as the express aim of the Bill, which is to encourage landlords to make more farms available to let; and I think that I am not misquoting the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, when I say that he, too, doubted whether this would happen. There will be so little difference after the Bill is enacted that I do not see it happening.<lb/>
But having poured what I fear my noble friend can only regard as somewhat lukewarm water on his Bill, I must very sincerely and warmly congratulate him, if not on producing some kind of consensus between the Scottish Landowners' Federation and the National Farmers' Union certainly on harnessing them, for when the 1968 legislation was passed (in which I, too, was rather heavily involved) one could hardly say that relations were warm between those two bodies.<lb/>
<col>204</col>
Legislation on Scottish land tenure has travelled a very long road, and it is quite interesting to note that in this year of 1983 it is exactly 100 years since an Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act first made it possible for the remainder of an agricultural lease to be bequeathed. Before that, there was no such possibility. As has been mentioned, there have been many milestones along the road&#x2014;some slightly more prominent than others. One might describe some as kilometre posts rather than milestones. There was legislation in 1949, 1958 and 1968, and this present legislation merits some consideration, for it is from what happened then that the proposals now before us stem. What was then described as "strong pressure" from the National Farmers' Union encouraged the then Government to bring in the legislation which exists today.<lb/>
As a result of that, as noble Lords know, not only can a husband or a wife, or a son or a daughter, real or adopted, be named as heirs, but these near relations of future generations are given the same rights. Of course, it does not follow that these heirs will be successful. As my noble friend has said, they have to satisfy various qualifications, with the possible involvement of the land court. But what I remember arguing strenuously in 1968 is that that move would inevitably reduce the number of farms which landlords would be prepared to offer to let, and that it would become much more difficult for a young man to get into farming. I make this point not only because a young man is keen to farm but because I have always believed that it is essential to bring new blood into farming, just as in every other industry, for the invigoration of it.<lb/>
As I said, when all this was going on the National Farmers' Union and the Scottish Landowners' Federation were very far from seeing eye to eye. I must tell the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, that I am one of those who does not fall into the category into which he grouped us. I have been a member of the National Farmers' Union for a very long time. I have never been a member of the federation. But in 1968 I found myself in the position of arguing strenuously against the National Farmers' Union and in favour of the federation. However, I found then that warnings to the National Farmers' Union about the inevitable reduction in farms to let fell on totally deaf ears. The National Farmers' Union thrive on controversy, and I am sure they will not mind my pointing out that the pressure which they exerted then has produced precisely the wrong result.<lb/>
My noble friend has pointed out the decline in the number of farms to let during the last 10 years, and the NFU are now expressing anxiety. They say they believe in the system, and they want to do something to halt the decline. I do not minimise the advantages of amending the rules which bind an arbiter when he is adjudicating a rent; nor do I minimise the advantages of changing the rent review period from five years to three, or tackling the vexed question of so-called key money. But none of these changes will do anything to satisfy the express aim of the National Farmers' Union to produce more farms to let. The rules for succession to tenancies, which I still regard as basic to the problem, are to be amended only in the very slightest of ways.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0111"/>
<col>205</col>
Since 1968 something has been happening which the advocates of that particular legislation&#x2014;surely not the political advocates&#x2014;can have neither envisaged nor desired. Since 1968 landlords have been playing a much more active and general part as partners. The partnership system was born out of a determination by all concerned, both landlords and would-be tenants, to avoid the restrictions that were imposed by the 1968 legislation. According to Mr. MacKay in another place, this system has been on the increase as the landlord-tenant system has declined. It is now a regular feature of many estates, at the expense of the traditional system. Share farming is in its infancy, but I am quite certain that it will grow. Both systems will ease the way into farming for many young men.<lb/>
As the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, pointed out, finance is by no means a small or minor problem. Having looked at my own valuation figures for 1968, it appears that the costs of going into a farm today are up by between five and 10 times. The irony&#x2014;which I hope the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, will appreciate&#x2014;is that the junior partner (if one may so describe him) in either system, partnership or share farming, who would formerly have been a tenant will not have the security which he had before the last milestone on this long road was passed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00750"><member>Lord Burton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, must declare an interest as an agricultural landlord and also as an agricultural tenant. I must declare a further interest as a member of the SLF executive and a member of the NFU area committee. As such, I welcome this modest alteration to the agricultural law of Scotland. All parties seem to acknowledge the need for young men to be able to get a foot on the farming ladder. This is obviously of the greatest importance if our great and efficient agricultural industry is to thrive. One of the best methods of securing this foothold, we are told, is to be able to procure the lease of a farm so that the landlord provides a large proportion of the capital required.<lb/>
Latterly, however, the letting of agricultural property, particularly of the poorer ground and more especially in Scotland, has been a most unattractive investment. Not only has the return on capital been very low compared with modern interest rates, but Scottish landlords have been subjected to certain disadvantages compared with England's. As a landlord in both countries, I know that, among other things, the level of Scottish rents is way below those which are the rule in England. Indeed, the Highlands of Scotland have been subjected to certain disadvantages, even compared with other parts of Scotland. For example, our ancestors granted leases to smallholders who became crofters. These tenants are now fragmenting highland estates by exercising their right compulsorily to acquire their holdings for nominal capital sums. Indeed, they are some of the very few individuals who have the right compulsorily to acquire somebody else's property.<lb/>
Now, however, the Opposition is threatening further compulsory acquisition of tenanted land. This must inevitably be a great deterrent to any landlord to let his land, if he can avoid doing so. Indeed, the noble Lord,
<col>206</col>
Lord Ross of Marnock, issued further threats today and gave no apology for the 1949 Act, the 1958 Act or the 1968 Act. I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso. I thought the noble Lord had given himself credit for these Acts and that he had fathered them, but I am prepared to accept that this is not the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00751"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord expect that I would ever take credit for a Tory Act of 1958 which took away altogether security of tenure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00752"><member>Lord Burton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord said that he was on the committee, and because of what he said I thought that he had had a great deal of influence on these Bills.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00753"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: No.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00754"><member>Lord Burton</member><membercontribution>: The fact is that these Acts have caused a drop in agricultural lets from 36 per cent. of holdings to 31 per cent. or, as the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, said, from 80 per cent. to 30 per cent. Whatever the percentage, there has been a marked drop in agricultural tenancies in Scotland. Therefore, Scottish landowners, not surprisingly, went to the National Farmers' Union to try to get some proposals introduced. This Bill is the result. Regrettably, the proposals put forward by the Landowners' Federation have been very much watered down. Indeed, I very much doubt whether these proposals will provide the incentive for more land to become available for let. I was very pleased to hear my noble friend Lord Stodart of Leaston agree with this. He was more forceful than I intend to be. I rather hope that I am wrong, but time will tell.<lb/>
My fear is that this Bill will not produce more agricultural leases. A farm which I own will become vacant next May and I am in a quandary about what to do with it. The moment I sign a lease I shall probably reduce the value of the property by 50 per cent. I do not believe that this can be good for agriculture.<lb/>
I was pleased to hear my noble friend the Minister say that some changes might be made to Clause 2. I am not very happy with the clause as it stands at the moment and I hope that it will be possible to alter its wording. My noble friend the Minister may be pleased to hear that on 19th May when the Committee stage of the Bill is to take place there is to be an SLF open day. Therefore, I apologise in advance for the fact that I may be unable to be here for the Committee stage. Clause 2(<i>b</i>)(iii) requires examination, particularly as regards the reference to the goodwill between landowner and tenant.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, complained about the lack of statistical information concerning agricultural holdings. The noble Lord's complaint puzzles me. I have been a farmer for some years and twice a year I have to fill in a very large form which gives all the acreage or, perhaps I should say, hectare statistics. That change, incidentally, caused some confusion; one had to translate the acres into hectares. One is required to give details of all the cropping. An enormous amount of statistical information is available to the Ministry of Agriculture, so I
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0112"/>
<col>207</col>
cannot understand what the noble Lord is complaining about.<lb/>
I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, for having said so clearly what I should have liked to say about the Bill. I agree, perhaps surprisingly, with everything that he said about it. I welcome the Bill on the basis that half a loaf is better than no bread at all and I thank my noble friend and the Government for it. All I would ask the Government to do, if they can, is to try to ensure that this legislation is dealt with expeditiously, so that if there is an election in the near future it is not scuppered. My noble friend the Minister must be well pleased with the welcome which his Bill has received.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00756"><member>Lord Rugby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it not be true to say that agriculture has developed over the past 40 years into an enormous asset-stripping exercise, in which the amalgamation of land has virtually prevented any young man from getting his foot on the ladder at all? This is because the arbitration system that has existed has worked totally in favour of the landlord and totally out of favour of the tenant. It is a well known fact that anybody who wishes to dispute an arbitration claim dare not do so because he is told straight away that the arbitrator will be upset and will only increase the arbitration figure against him. Consequently, one has the situation of people accepting almost anything that is put on front of them rather than face that music.<lb/>
There is also the problem of the young man wanting to come into farming. He does not have any experience, and so he is ruled out straight away. He has no capital, and so he is ruled out straight away. It is an enormous tragedy of agriculture today that, with these asset-stripping exercises and amalgamations into bigger and bigger units, a young man simply does not have a chance of coming in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00757"><member>Lord Drumalbyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Rugby, will forgive me, what does he mean by "asset stripping" in this sense? Does he mean that part of the assets are disposed of? If that is so, to whom are they disposed? Does he mean that they are being disposed to farmers&#x2014;to tenants?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00758"><member>Lord Rugby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that it is perfectly true to say that these big institutions and financial houses come in very largely from the point of view of using the land as a method either of safeguarding capital or of improving their capital position. That is what I am really saying.<lb/>
A new situation is arising in agriculture today which is almost a sinister one. It is the fact that there are a number of charities which are in fact religious cults buying land. I have seen a very large spread of religious cults actually buying land and bringing in their followers to act as the workers on that land, which is free labour, and no doubt they are given the benefits of charity tax avoidance. They amalgamate land and set up young men working on the land in a religious context rather than in a farming context. This is happening in quite a big way.<lb/>
When one is now legislating for agriculture, one has to advise people who are on the arbitration side of
<col>208</col>
these various problems that they should consider very much the point that a young man with limited capital and requiring experience, and who has a young family, should somehow get a starter farm; and that that should be part of the calculation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00760"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the way in which this Bill has been received by noble Lords, with the possible exception of the last speaker, the noble Lord, Lord Rugby, but I shall think about what he said while I am on my feet. Nobody pretends&#x2014;and least of all do I pretend&#x2014;that this Bill is other than a fairly modest legislative change. Certainly, nobody pretends that it will lead to a significant increase in the number of farms becoming available to let.<lb/>
Many noble Lords pointed out that we are facing a long-term problem and that there can be no overnight solution. But this Government consider it important to take the initiative in this matter with measures that have the support of both sides of the industry in Scotland. If I have a criticism of the speeches of noble Lords this afternoon, it is that not enough credit has been given to the fact that the two sides of the industry&#x2014;and traditionally, at least in Scotland, landlords and tenants are not supposed to be even on speaking terms&#x2014;did sit down and thresh out over a great number of meetings a package they thought was fair and beneficial in the circumstances.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, who says that he has the welfare of farmers at heart, sneered at that and said, in effect, there was some kind of cosy NFU/SLF agreement with the balance of advantage to the Scottish Landowners' Federation. He does not have the welfare of farmers at heart&#x2014;and certainly he does not understand them&#x2014;if he can possibly imagine that Scottish farmers could have something like that put across them&#x2014;particularly when this package went back to every single branch in the country for their comments and agreement, or disagreement.<lb/>
Another point we have not touched on very much is that fiscal matters have deterred and continue to deter landlords from making land available to let under the traditional landlord and tenant system. The worst of the lot of course was the capital transfer tax introduced by the then Socialist Government. That vindictive tax had a number of important effects: it stopped private planting in the forestry sector almost stone dead, and it dried up what lettings there were, so far as farm tenancies were concerned, almost overnight. It is a measure of this Government's concern that in successive Finance Acts we have introduced a range of important taxation reliefs for agricultural land. I shall briefly remind the House of those reliefs.<lb/>
Generally speaking, we have lessened the burden of capital transfer tax and capital grants tax. The special position of tenanted agricultural land was recognised in the 1981 Finance Act by the introduction of relief for the first time on that land for CTT purposes at the rate of 20 per cent. In his last Budget Statement, my right honourable and learned friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that this rate of relief for let land was to be increased from 20 per cent. to 30 per cent., and indicated that this should help to mitigate one of the factors reducing the number of farms
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0113"/>
<col>209</col>
available for letting&#x2014;and both sides of the industry in Scotland agree with this view.<lb/>
The recent Budget Statement also included a proposal to allow farmers to pay CTT by interest-free instalments over 10 years rather than eight years, which is the situation at present. There were also in the proposals those which would allow tenant farmers who were required to live on their land to purchase a house off the farm to the benefit of tax relief on the mortgage. In previous Finance Acts, provision has been made for the value of the tenant's interest in an agricultural holding in Scotland to be left out of account in assessing capital transfer tax on the death of the tenant and the removal of the provision under which the Inland Revenue could claw back the CTT charge if the successor to a tenancy disposed of it during his lifetime.<lb/>
These taxation reliefs are a positive expression of the Government's concern about the decline in the tenanted sector. All this I believe is welcome to noble Lords on the Liberal Benches. As we are now adopting, even in this House, a slightly higher political profile than is our wont, I found myself in possession of a document entitled <i>Liberal Country</i>&#x2014;which is not, surprisingly enough, an organically-produced margarine but a manifesto for rural Britain by a number of Liberals. I see that this form of relief, basically speaking, is agreed to in that document.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, said, consideration of the Northfield report has played a very large part in the thoughts behind this Bill. The publication of the report in May 1979, shortly after the then Government fell, must have come as an unwelcome shock because a lot of the old nostrums were rejected, and rejected without any equivocation, by that committee. Examples were the general nationalisation of agricultural land; legislation to regulate farming partnerships; <i>quasi</i>-tenancies and similar arrangements, which were held not to be justified; and an all-embracing rural land authority, which the Labour Party had proposed, was rejected.<lb/>
So the noble Lord, Lord Ross, on the one hand says that this is a Bill which does not go very far and at the same time complains that we should have gone very much further in carrying out a number of Northfield recommendations. When he complains that the period between rent reviews&#x2014;not arbitration, as my noble friend Lord Massereene said, I am sure by a slip of the tongue&#x2014;was reduced from five to three years, that is directly consistent with Northfield; that is what he said and recommended.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00764"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was reminded, while the noble Lord was speaking, of seeing in yesterday's <i>Hansard,</i> at column 126, that when his
<col>210</col>
noble friend Lord Longford had been speaking for some considerable time on relationships between the third world and the USSR, he said on looking at the annunciator, "I cannot have been speaking for 22 minutes", and his noble friend Lord Bishopston, speaking from the heart, said, "No, it only seems like it". I think the noble Lord. Lord Ross, was actually 25 minutes this afternoon.<lb/>
I am not going to be tempted to go down the interesting by-ways of the Highlands and Islands Development Board and its powers and functions. One of my regrets during the last four years has been that nobody from the Benches opposite has seen fit to ask, even by way of Unstarred Question, what should happen to the board and its powers. That is one of the many things in regard to which I have experienced disappointment. I am also not going to go down the by-ways of some other agreeable matters which have been raised.<lb/>
The importance of this measure is that the changes do have the support of both sides of the industry. When some noble Lords, such as my noble friend Lord Stodart and my noble friend Lord Burton, say in effect that the Bill is not leaning far enough in favour of the landlord&#x2014;that is what it amounted to, because my noble friend says the Bill is ineffective and what he means is that it would not be ineffective if it was more favourable for landlords; there is no other construction that one could put on it&#x2014;and the noble Lord, Lord Ross, says that the Bill is rather too much in favour of landlords as opposed to tenants, this exemplifies what I mean: this Bill has the favour of both sides of the industry.<lb/>
The point was taken about land registration, and with that I couple sales of land to institutions and foreigners, not counting the English, Irish and other lesser breeds. The Government have considered this matter of land registration. There is need for adequate information. The cost of introducing an elaborate system which would provide the sort of information that I think noble Lords would like simply would not be justified. Statistics have improved and my department has been monitoring (if that is the word) the records of purchases of this type. I can say this. The latest figures available indicate that in the three years 1979&#2013;81 there was a total of 65 sales of agricultural land to financial institutions. I emphasise agricultural land and not land for forestry. And the land remains in agricultural use after the sale. The area involved was approximately 19,000 hectares. So over those three years about 10 per cent. of the agricultural land changing hands in Scotland has been sold to financial institutions, which represents, I submit, only a small proportion of the total agricultural land in Scotland, because of course only a small proportion changes hands each year.<lb/>
So far as foreigners are concerned, in the period 1979&#2013;81 there were 20 sales of properties to foreign nationals with some agricultural interest. Most of it was poor quality land, probably for sporting purposes, and it certainly lay outside the main agricultural areas. It was used for sporting purposes such as deer-stalking. The activities of foreign nationals since 1981 seem to have been very much less than in the years immediately preceding Northfield, probably because of the escalation of the price of land in Scotland.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0114"/>
<col>211</col>
At this point, I can confirm that adopted children and illegitimate children, arising by way of succession in respect of persons dying on or after 25th November, 1968, are for the purposes of this Bill "near relatives".<lb/>
As I have said, we are working to make Clause 2 of the Bill better, if it does need to have improvements, and that will no doubt come forward in Committee. I am conscious that there are points which have been made to which I have not replied. I think they are Committee points. An example is the widow and orphan point brought up by my noble friend Lord Massereene; we can go into that in Committee.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ross, complained because he did not like the way in which the Bill was drafted nor indeed the language. In fact it is in some ways a consolidating measure. One is always in the difficulty, particularly where one is regulating the legal rights as between one class of citizen and another, that if one tries to be precise and not leave room for dispute and litigation one has to be very careful about the choice of language. On the other hand, by being careful you do not provide the kind of statute which is everybody's bedtime reading. We struggle to take a line down the middle. I think that that is quite enough from me by way of winding up. I commend the Bill to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00773"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 2, line 3, after ("shall") insert ("after consultation with the Telecoms Equipment Manufacturing Association and the Trade Unions recognised by the successor Company").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00774">The noble Lord said: As we begin consideration of the first amendment of what I fear will be a long Committee stage on this Bill, I should at the outset make quite clear that we are implacably opposed to the purposes of this Bill, but we will seek in a constructive way to try to improve what we believe to be a bad Bill. The Government themselves are still obviously trying to improve the Bill. I bring to noble Lords' attention the fact that 37 new amendments were tabled by the Government this Tuesday. I should have complained bitterly about the late tabling of such a large number of amendments had it not been for the fact that only one of these amendments may be reached in our consideration of the Bill this evening.</p>
<col>212</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00775">Amendment No. 1 seeks to ensure that the appointment of the Director General of Telecommunications is not made without consultation with those organisations which will be affected by his action. The clause as it stands enables the Secretary of State to appoint whoever he wishes without consulting anyone. The appointment of a director general is of great importance, as on his shoulders will ultimately lie the responsibility for the British telephone service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00776">The director general's first duty will be to establish the Office of Telecommunications. Oftel will have the responsibility of monitoring the activities of British Telecom and other organisations in an effort to ensure that they honour and keep their licence obligations. The responsibility of the director general and Oftel will be to take action to enforce those obligations if they are not carried out, and to initiate licence amendments if licences are shown to be inadequate. Equally, Oftel will have the responsibility to receive, consider and follow up complaints from individual consumers and firms that use telecommunication services or buy telephones or other telecommunication apparatus.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00777">The director general will also be obliged to check that British Telecom and other organisations which supply telecommunication services or apparatus compete fairly with each other and do not abuse their monopoly or engage in practices which prevent, restrict or distort competition. British Telecom are concerned that the powers of the director are capable of arbitrary application, with only limited appeal against his decision, despite the width and scope of his powers. They are also concerned by the fact that licence enforcement lies in the hands of the director general and can be challenged only on the grounds that he has acted beyond his statutory powers and has not gone through the necessary statutory processes. The licence, when granted, may be amended by the director general against the successor company's wishes, subject only to a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This also is a cause of concern to British Telecom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00778">The director general will have powers to direct, restrict or prohibit the day-to-day activities of telecommunication companies. It is for this reason, and because there are some 235,000 employees in the industry and another 70,000 employees in Telecoms Equipment Manufacturing Association jobs, that it is vitally important that there should be this consultation. I know that in his reply the Minister is likely to say that of course he will consult, but this is not enough. A requirement for him to consult, as outlined in the amendment, should be in the Bill. I beg to move the amendment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00779"><member>Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran</member><membercontribution>: In rising to support this amendment, I think that it would be appropriate for me to make a somewhat neutral introduction. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede, that this is a bad Bill, but we on these Benches will endeavour to be constructive in the amendments we are proposing. It is ironic that the Government's overwhelming and almost passionate desires for the so-called liberalisation of the market for the provision of telecommunications equipment&#x2014;and the Government's announcement that it is giving new
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0115"/>
<col>213</col>
opportunities for British industry by weakening the dominance of British Telecom&#x2014;could have precisely the opposite effect. Unless amendments on the lines of this amendment concerning the appointment of the director general, and the later amendments concerning the scope of his duties, receive the careful consideration of the Government&#x2014;in different words possibly, but the theme being adopted&#x2014;there will be an even greater loss of confidence in the actions of the Government in this field.<lb/>
There is no convincing argument for privatisation as envisaged in the Bill. The <i>Economist</i> recently referred to your Lordships as providing:
<quote>"the last chance to catch British Telecom before it escapes untamed into the private sector".</quote>
Referring generally to this Bill, it went on to say:
<quote>"All that will have been achieved is to set a &#x00A3;8 billion predatory monster free.".</quote>
This amendment and others with which I am concerned are therefore designed to help the Government to create a climate of confidence so that there will be less unfair competition in carrying out the proposals of the Bill and that the Bill will create more jobs in the United Kingdom and better relationships for employees, including the famous research teams and innovators in the BT research establishments, such as Martlesham.<lb/>
I can see the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, looking at me. I hope that he will not disapprove too strongly of my next few words. Incidentally, in the public interest, the object of my amendments is to create less work for lawyers than the Bill is bound to create if it continues in its present form. The amendment before your Lordships should go a long way towards giving confidence to British Telecom employees and to users of Telecom systems and their customers as to the way that the Office of Telecommunications would be run. Before the appointment of this director general, as the amendment suggests, there would be consultation with the Telecoms Equipment Manufacturing Association (TEMA) and the trade unions.<lb/>
Perhaps I ought at this stage to declare an interest. I was a guest of TEMA at their annual dinner only a fortnight ago. I am consoled in making that declaration by the fact that the Secretary of State for Industry was also there and spoke very warmly about the activities of the association. So perhaps I have wasted a little of the Committee's time in declaring such an interest, when the Secretary of State himself was also so prominently present there.<lb/>
Those of us who are concerned with industrial and technical problems in industry know how difficulties arise in interpreting not only contracts but sections of an Act. In the case of disagreements or potential disagreements, surely there would be more confidence in the ability of the director general to deal with such problems or potential problems if he had been appointed after the kind of consultation envisaged by this amendment.<lb/>
The <i>Economist</i> article to which I have just referred prompted the Secretary of State for Industry to write a long letter to the magazine which appears in the current issue. He referred to some of the powers of
<col>214</col>
Oftel and the orders which Oftel could make. In referring to licences, the letter states that,
<quote>"Such orders can be made when Oftel thinks there is a breach (there is no delay to establish the facts), the order can require sweeping remedial action (any step which in Oftel's opinion is requisite) and failure to obey an order leads to fines or imprisonment or both".</quote>
Yet as at present drafted the Bill envisages that one man, appointed in the way to which the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, referred, should have to deal with such problems.<lb/>
In his letter, the Secretary of State then goes on to say that,
<quote>"Oftel will have a duty (enforceable in the courts) to promote efficiency and economy on the part of operators".</quote>
So at once the Secretary of State himself envisages problems&#x2014;serious problems&#x2014;which require the intervention of the courts. As I have indicated, the amendments that we have put forward try whenever possible to avoid reference to the courts. Before the noble Earl, Lord Mansfield, sat down after winding up the debate which preceded this Committee stage, he remarked on how important it was to try to avoid conflicts arising in the courts by ensuring clarity of expression in Acts of Parliament.<lb/>
I am a little surprised that the Secretary of State himself indicated that the director general, or his office, should have such powers, and I am also a little surprised at the reference he made to taking the disputes to the courts. I have the highest regard for much of the work of the Secretary of State for Industry. By chance on one occasion he and I found ourselves in a trade mark case, led by a most distinguished advocate, who is now a very much respected High Court judge, Mr. Justice Arnold. Even in that case our attempt was to limit the applications of court processes. It seems to me that, as one step towards that kind of situation, this amendment would be effective.<lb/>
Since Clause 1 is so important, I have also considered whether Amendment No. 1 alone is enough, and, with the leave of your Lordships' Committee, I should like to refer also to Amendment No. 2, as well as to Amendments Nos. 3 to 5 and Amendment No. 12, so as perhaps to save a little of your Lordships' time. Amendment No. 2, which I have proposed, and which is supported by the noble Lords, Lord Ponsonby and Lord Bruce of Donington, provides that the director general shall not operate on his own. If Amendment No. 1 is approved, the director general will be chosen following consultation with the trade unions and TEMA. I go further than that and ask rhetorically whether it would not be more appropriate for a director general with such important duties to carry out&#x2014;duties which inevitably will lead to conflict, as indicated by the letter of the Secretary of State for Industry&#x2014;to have around him a group of experts or of persons with experience in industry and trade unions. In the subsequent amendments associated with the main amendment (No. 2), I have suggested that the proposed council shall include two members of trade unions. The council would in effect be an advisory body, possibly on a part-time basis, to which there could be referred from time to time disputes arising regarding licences, modification to licences, or the scope of the duties of the director general. I should also
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0116"/>
<col>215</col>
be prepared to suggest, as one of the amendments proposes, that the director general should be the chairman of the council.<lb/>
I want to make it quite clear that I am not suggesting an advisory council to which all matters would have to be referred by the director general, thus slowing up the organisation and administration. I am suggesting that, having been selected after consultation as proposed in Amendment No. 1, the director general should also have the assistance of a council, or call it what you will; a group of people who could help him in dealing with difficult matters of importance to industry.<lb/>
Having analysed the position very carefully as to the problems which a man in the position of the director general will have to deal with, I have certainly come to the conclusion that his appointment should be made after consultation with TEMA and the trade unions. I have included a reference to my Amendment No. 2 in the hope that, when he replies, the Minister will be good enough to direct some of his remarks towards it, though later, if there is time, I shall develop the theme in relation to Amendment No. 2 and my subsequent amendments.<lb/>
At this stage, I must register an apology to your Lordships' Committee, since I shall be unable to remain here throughout the debate. I see from the expression of cheerfulness on the part of the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, that he is very pleased about that, though of course I may have misinterpreted the meaning of his smile. I had expected that other Bills would be dealt with today, and I am committed to an engagement which I cannot at this stage cancel. I beg to support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00780">5.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00781"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: In opposing Amendment No. 1, I should like to limit my very brief observations to that amendment, and leave the monster languishing in his den for the moment. The noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, peripherally referred to Amendment No. 3, but, with the greatest respect to him, I must say that, as I understand it, what is envisaged is not an advisory function, but a decision-making role. To revert to Amendment No. 1, I would say that it enjoins the Secretary of State to entertain mandatory consultations with both the employers' association and recognised trade unions before appointing a director. I think that that is novel. Mandatory consultation constitutes a perhaps unacceptable derogation from the exercise of administrative discretion. It is a departure from past practice. It has no legal efficacy. It is, as I understand it, cosmetic, in order to give confidence. Finally, does not extending the functions of trade unions and employers' associations to the question of appointments reflect a misunderstanding of the true nature of those functions? For those reasons I oppose the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00782"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: It is of great importance that we should realise what a mammoth organisation is being created. There will be a huge hotch-potch of varying responsibilities, with the people of the country being represented by the Government and the Secretary of State in the first instance. All the various people who
<col>216</col>
are to invest their money in the new organisation will, I assume, want to have their voice heard as much as the voice of the state will be heard, and that is quite fair. That is the position with regard to the principle of the matter. What happens when the organisation gets under way, I am afraid that we shall have to wait and see, but there are a number of points I would like answered.<lb/>
First and foremost, the people of our land are, in my judgment, being robbed by the Bill. However, through the Secretary of State they have a right to have their voice heard. They have a right to be heard because the measure at the moment is a Bill and not an Act of Parliament. It is still the people's property. Does anyone disagree that it is still the people's property?<lb/>
We have a right to submit what should be done. This powerful individual is to be appointed by the Secretary of State and to be responsible to him. We have therefore a right to demand answers to our questions. How will the post be advertised? In what manner will it be advertised? Where will it be advertised? It should be advertised in such a manner that anyone interested in the post has the right to apply for it. If that is not accepted, one has to decide those who have not the right in Britain to apply for the job of director. There is a need to examine closely the sane suggestion of my noble friend, who proposed the first amendment, that the Secretary of State should consult with important people like TEMA and the trade unions who are experts in the machinery of running the new organisation due to their massive experience gained in the previous organisation.<lb/>
I would have thought that a sensible Secretary of State would realise that one of his most important jobs is the appointment of a director. There are, of course, Permanent Secretaries and other important people with whom he will consult. However, when it comes to the actual running of the organization, I would have thought it would be wise and prudent of the Secretary of State to have discussions with those who will be involved from the outset. They will be able to give the Secretary of State the benefit of their experience and their wisdom on the calibre of the individual to be appointed. I consider the amendment very worthwhile. It should commend itself to the House.<lb/>
I turn now to the proposition outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran. Unlike the noble Lord, I am not necessarily singing for a supper that I have had. The arguments, in my judgment, were very sound. They were very applicable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00783"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I wonder whether the noble Lord would like to reconsider the terms of the assertion he has just made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00784"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: It was a humorous remark which, I notice, caused the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, to smile when he declared his interest. I thought it was probably not worth declaring. It is in vein of the work of Lord Lloyd to declare every little thing with which he might have been concerned when he speaks in this House. I commend him on his exactness and his thoroughness. He gives an example to a few other Members of this Chamber. They will note that the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd, when he speaks, is always careful to make this transparently clear. If it had been
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0117"/>
<col>217</col>
a bun and a cup of tea, he would have made the point in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I wish to discuss the wisdom of his submission in calling for the creation of a council of six that will include two trade union members. Here again, this should commend itself both to the Committee and to the Government. The amendment makes it transparently clear that the council will have a chairman who will be the director himself. There will be no one between. The proposition is that the council of six wise men should be able to advise the Director General who will always attend the meetings because he is chairman. He will no doubt also be responsible for the agenda and have particular regard to possible administrative changes. However, rather than carry them out only to find that he had made an error, which would mean calling together the trade unions and other interested bodies, he will have the issue at his finger-tips.<lb/>
What is proposed is that prevention is better than cure. Neither amendment dramatically changes the Bill. Yet the points submitted by my noble friend and by the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd, represent worthy amendments. It would appear that Lord Lloyd's party, and certainly mine, are opposed to the Bill. It is nevertheless in the tradition of our Parliament that amendments are proposed that seek to improve a Bill even when one disagrees with it. I hope therefore that the Government Front Bench will accept what I say in that spirit which is peculiar to the British Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00785"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: I wish to support my noble friend Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede in Amendment No. 1. There is no intention of debating the whole question of the regulatory machinery. We are dealing only with the narrow issue of the appointment of the Director General. We can deal with the wider issue at a later stage. While appreciating the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, supported by my noble friend Lord Molloy, a separate principle is involved. We would prefer to keep the two issues separate. We might support one but not support the other. We shall support both but there might be a difference of view.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, said that Amendment No. 1 would make a mandatory qualification and added that this was an unusual provision. So is the Bill an unusual Bill. It is a massive Bill of so-called privatisation. It is of a calibre that has not previously appeared before your Lordships' House. It contains many important features. I am certain that the Government want to make the regulatory machinery a success. This amendment will help towards achieving that aim. The Department of Industry's own paper has stressed the detailed knowledge that will be required to carry out this machinery. It will involve expert knowledge of telecommunications, of technology and of commercial aspects&#x2014;all in one man.<lb/>
On previous Bills that have passed industries over to the private sector, we have often criticised the great powers given to the Secretary of State. Now we are giving great powers to another individual to be called the Director General. When we come to deal with the machinery, I hope that we shall make some of these points effective. Everything that has been stated in departmental papers and ministerial statements
<col>218</col>
stresses the importance of this post. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, argued that this might be just cosmetic. If industrial relations and consultation with the unions in this massive industry are assisted, that alone will justify this appointment.<lb/>
The noble Lord also questioned whether or not the employers' body should be consulted. But TEMA is not the employers' body. In fact, TEMA is the manufacturers' body from which British Telecommunications obtains 95 per cent. of its equipment. It is vital that it should have confidence in the director general. In view of the vital importance of this post, not only is it essential that there he a democratic procedure&#x2014;call it "cosmetic" if you like&#x2014;but because of the very important considerations here it is sheer common sense. Moreover, it will also assist the Government in their objective of giving both the manufacturers and the workforce some confidence in the regulatory machinery. Later we shall put our views on the regulatory machinery, but if it is to come into effect it is vital that both the manufacturers and the employees should have a great degree of confidence in the director general. That is why the amendment should be supported.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00786">5.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00787"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I understand the concern of some of your Lordships about consultation before the holder of any important post is appointed. However, I do not believe that formal consultation is appropriate. It is not provided for in the appointment of the Director General of Fair Trading, nor in the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of the Civil Aviation Authority. This is not to say that the Secretary of State makes such appointments without informal consultations. But the need for consideration of a wide range of suitable appointees, for flexibility in discussions and discretion in approaching persons who are already in employment, all preclude formal consultations.<lb/>
However, there is another reason why I cannot accept the amendment. There will always be some person with an interest who thinks that he should be consulted. The proposed list of bodies who have to be consulted emphasises this difficulty. It is simply not possible to consult everyone. Why should consultation be limited to one equipment manufacturing association? Incidentally, I am happy that the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, managed to have dinner with them but he actually got the name slightly wrong. Indeed, the name is slightly wrong in the amendment, and maybe the noble Lord went to the wrong place&#x0021; In fact the correct title of TEMA is the Telecommunication Engineering and Manufacturing Association and not the Telecommunication Equipment Manufacturing Association.<lb/>
What about the Electronic Engineering Association and the Business Equipment Trade Association? What about system operators and providers of telecommunication services over systems? Why are they not to be consulted? What about the trade unions representing those who work, for example, in the Kingston-upon-Hull telephone system? What about consumer bodies? The director will be required to deal with their complaints. The list is endless. It is simply not practicable to provide for formal consultations in the manner suggested in the amendment.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0118"/>
<col>219</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Molloy, asked me about how we would appoint the director general. I can assure the noble Lord that the appointment will be made in accordance with the normal procedures for all public appointments. We are certainly looking at the possibility of advertising for the post in order to attract the best possible candidates. I can see, for example, that on the present scale the salary is &#x00A3;35,000 a year, which is a good deal more than I get&#x0021;
I believe that I have been able to describe&#x2014;at least, I hope so&#x2014;some of the difficulties which this amendment presents. Of course the most important one is that the range of people to be consulted is so great that it is not possible to put a definitive list in the amendment. I hope, for that reason, that the noble Lord will not press it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00788"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: When the Minister began his reply he gave two examples&#x2014;the Office of Fair Trading and the Civil Aviation Authority&#x2014;in which appointments had been made without consultation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00789"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Without formal consultation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00790"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: I agree, without formal consultation laid down in any statute. I should like from my own experience to give a contrary example and it is a very small one. My noble friend Lord Molloy referred to the organisation in this Bill as being a mammoth. The organisation to which I wish to refer is a minnow by comparison.<lb/>
I am referring to the setting up of the Co-operative Development Agency under the 1978 Act. I happen to know that consultation took place with the appropriate bodies on that occasion because, as a result of the consultations, I was the fortunate person who emerged as the chairman of the Co-operative Development Agency. That Act provided that the Minister should consult with representatives of the co-operative movement. The Minister went on to say that there are many organisations involved and that therefore it is difficult to have consultations. But I assure him that if he knows about the co-operative movement he will realise that it is an extremely complex organisation with many ramifications. Yet, under that Act it was perfectly feasible to have satisfactory statutorily required consultations before the appointments were made.<lb/>
Therefore, not only do I see no reason why it should not happen in this case, but I see an overwhelmingly greater reason why it should happen in this case. As regards the organisation to which I have referred, the staff numbered only a couple or dozen or something of that kind and the amount of money involved was less than &#x00A3;1 million. If formal consultation was necessary for the setting up of such an organisation, then when we are talking about an organisation which employs a quarter of a million people, and realise that when the director general's work gets under way he himself will have to consult with representatives of the organisations mentioned in the amendment, is it not likely that his consultations day by day will be smoother and more effective if he has come to his appointment after consultation with those organisations? I suggest that this amendment is an extremely necessary one and I give it my support.</membercontribution></p>
<col>220</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00791"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I hope that I may be permitted to intervene again. I suggest to the noble Lord that there may well be difficulties on the other side of the coin as well. Although the noble Lord has cited an example where he says that formal consultation was provided for, I have no doubt that the list of people who are required to be consulted under the legislation to which he refers is not exhaustive and there may well be people who are not required to be consulted in the appointment to which he refers. In this context that could certainly create a good deal of difficulty if, for example, TEMA was written into the Bill and had been consulted, and one of the other trade associations to which I referred had not been consulted. I think that there would be no justice in that. In my view it is better to leave the Bill as it is and I hope that your Lordships will agree to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00792"><member>Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord the Minister has emphasised the fact that one of the main reasons why he has to reject this amendment is that the range of organisations to be consulted is so large and he has mentioned many other organisations. However, there are two defects in his argument.<lb/>
The first defect surely is that he has, with great respect, misread the amendment. The amendment is not conclusive about the number of organisations to be consulted. It says that two large organisations are to be consulted. There is nothing wrong in consulting other organisations if necessary.<lb/>
As regards the other defect in his argument for rejecting the amendment, the noble Lord said that it is far better to have informal discussions and informal inquiries. Would the noble Lord the Minister be prepared to disclose to the Committee the number of organisations which might be consulted informally in this way? Where is the harm in putting into an amendment that at least two large, respected organisations should be consulted? That does not prevent further organisations from being consulted informally or formally.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00793"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: As a Fellow of the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers, I take grave exception to its omission from the amendment, and will vote against the amendment on that ground as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00794"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: I have the strongest sympathy with the Institution of&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00795"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: The Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00796"><member>Lord Howie of Troon</member><membercontribution>: I have the strongest sympathy with the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers, and many other organisations have been omitted. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, has quite clearly said, there is no problem. This amendment simply says that in consultations, which presumably will take place&#x2014;because I find it inconceivable that the Government would blunder on into this appointment without consulting anybody&#x2014;two bodies should be included. There is nothing in the amendment or elsewhere to prevent the Government from casting their net as wide as they feel so inclined, just so long as they do not exclude these two organisations. The amendment is extremely sensible
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0119"/>
<col>221</col>
and extremely helpful, and the Government should accept it without further cavil.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00797"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: I believe that this amendment should be positively resisted because, in effect, it is dangerous. As all noble Lords are well aware, the telecommunications and, indeed, the information technology industries, are dynamic and volatile industries, and it is absolutely essential that whoever is appointed as director general be just as dynamic, and that nothing should be put in his way to hamper the decision-making process, because he will have to take some vitally important decisions which affect the commercial and economic future of this country. I would suggest that to bring in various interest groups as part of his statutory duty to consult would do nothing other than cramp his style.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00798"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: In his reply to the debate on this amendment I think that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, pulled a certain amount of wool over noble Lords' eyes. He set his face against any form of formal consultation. He made some comments about the particular list set out in the amendment, but he was not even prepared to concede any form of formal consultation on the appointment. I have had considerable support for this amendment and I think it right that the feeling of the Committee should be tested on it. I would remind noble Lords that we have even reached the situation today when the Prime Minister consults with the Church about the appointment of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00802">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00803">6.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00804"><member>Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran</member> moved Amendment No. 2:
<quote>Page 2, line 3, after ("appoint") insert ("a Council known as the Telecommunications Council (in this Act referred to as "the Council")")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00805">The noble Lord said: I beg to move that "a Council known as the Telecommunications Council (in this Act referred to as 'the Council')", should be created and appropriate words put into Clause 1, so that the Secretary of State will be appointing not only a Director General of Telecommunications but also a council. Earlier this evening I spoke about this council and its nature, but I am encouraged by the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, to make a few further observations. With the leave of the Committee I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10, all of which
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0120"/>
<col>223</col>
are concerned with the council and its structure, and also to Amendment No. 12.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00806">As the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, rightly indicated, Amendment No. 3 describes the functions of this council which I have suggested should be created to assist the director general. It is not to be concerned with all administrative problems, and therefore to hinder him in his work; but where there are disputes or potential disagreements which may arise as to the scope of his duties or the scope of licences, or as to what should be put into licences, he would have some experts, some representatives of industry, and, the amendment says, two representatives from the relevant associated trade unions, there to help him.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00807">Whether that group of persons should decide any of the problems that come up before it or are referred to it is a matter for further consideration. It is true, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, pointed out, that in my Amendment No. 3 it is mandatory in the sense that it says:
<quote>"The Director shall refer to the Council for decision any matters in which disputes have arisen or appear likely to arise relating to the administration and performance of the functions assigned or transferred to him under this Act."</quote>
If the Committee were to accept Amendment No. 2, which says that "a Council" should be appointed, then it would be a matter of administration. It would be a matter of creating guidance notes or guidelines, which would not appear in the Bill, as to how that council should be constructed. In one of my amendments, Amendment No. 4, I have suggested that the director shall be the chairman of this council, and that the number of members of the council should be seven, including the director. Naturally, that is not an amendment which I propose to press, but that is a matter for later discussion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00808">Amendments Nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 are consequential amendments to the Bill which I need not discuss further, but I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to Amendment No. 12. This amendment indicates the kind of problem that would in my view inevitably arise in the administration of this Bill. If I may read it, it says:
<quote>"In relation to any matter which is referred to the Council the Council shall consider whether any licence or agreement concerning any United Kingdom Consumer or United Kingdom Operator or foreign user or associations of such consumers, operators or users may effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition between United Kingdom operators in the United Kingdom or in markets outside the United Kingdom."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00809">Those words are not words which I have devised. They are taken almost verbatim from Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty, which deal with competition matters in relation to business activities in the European market. In passing, I should like to ask the Minister whether he has considered the effect of EEC competition law Articles 85 and 86 in connection with this Bill, because the scope of those articles of the Rome Treaty is bound to affect, particularly agreements of an international nature.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00810">It would be part of the function of the council to consider these matters. It may be appropriate to say that I had the honour of being co-opted recently to a committee of the EEC whose function was to consider what are the obstacles to trade between companies in
<col>224</col>
the EEC which have research and development activities. That committee sat for about nine months. It was ably and efficiently chaired by the noble Earl, Lord Shannon, who I am pleased to see in his place this evening. It has recently produced a report endeavouring to assist the commission on how to remove obstacles to trade when the companies have research and development activities and are concerned internationally in their business.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00811">It seems to me inevitable, therefore, that that kind of problem will arise with Oftel, and surely it would be far better that the director general, instead of merely relying on his staff, which he can appoint as he thinks fit, should have a council of the order of six persons to support him and give him such advice as is necessary. Therefore, I beg to move Amendment No. 2, that "a Council known as the Telecommunications Council" should be created to assist the director general.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00812"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: I rise to support the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, in his Amendment No. 2 and in the amendments which he mentioned as being in association with it. This amendment effectively starts to put some flesh onto the structure of Oftel. The Bill as it now stands creates an organisation with a head who has wide powers to direct the organisation. Inevitably there will be layers of staff beneath that particular head, but as of now we have no concept what those layers will be or who will act in the absence of the director, or what support he will have in terms of advice.<lb/>
We warmly welcome and support this amendment to create a telecommunications council. As I see the noble Lord's amendment, this will effectively be the Oftel board of directors. The proposal in Amendment No. 4 that two members of the council should be two trade union representatives is widely welcomed. The telecommunications industry has a fine record of partnership between those who work and those who employ in the industry. Noble Lords will recall that until 1979 trade union members previously sat on the old Post Office board before it was split into the post and telecommunications businesses after the 1981 Act, when this experiment in industrial democracy, which had been deemed a success by those involved, was ended by the present Government.<lb/>
As I have said, it was acknowledged that this experiment was a success and that the seven trade union nominees who sat on the board had no trouble in terms of divided loyalties between their unions and the work of the hoard as a whole, which many critics had suggested might happen in advance of this experiment taking off. A report was presented to the Post Office and the unions at the time which commented particularly on the part played by industrial democracy experiment at regional and area levels. The report concluded by saying that the people compiling the report had been impressed by the express desire from all sides to continue.<lb/>
It may be that the views of the independent members are particularly relevant here, for in addition to those who were generally enthusiastic about what was being achieved, or what might be achieved in the future, there was also a very strong view, even among those not generally in favour, that to withdraw at that
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0121"/>
<col>225</col>
stage would have been undesirable and would have a generally bad effect on the climate of industrial relations within the Post Office. The amendment will have the effect of creating this council and of diffusing the decision-making policy within Oftel and will enable more heads to be able to be consulted to bear on particular items of decision making. That would greatly strengthen the work of Oftel.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00814"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I oppose the series of amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, has spoken. For the moment I exclude Amendment No. 12. The effect of the series appears to be that one sets up a council instead of the director general. One enjoins the director, in matters of administration under the Act, to defer to decisions of that council. One ensures that one-third of that council&#x2014;the decision-making body&#x2014;is comprised of members of trade unions and one ensures that the appointment of staff should take place only after consultation with trade unions.<lb/>
These amendments would appear to have been sired out of Employment Act worker participation by Vredeling or perhaps vice versa. The administration of all British telecommunications as envisaged by the Bill must require a firm hand, sound and effective decision making and a relatively simple structure. This the Bill provides with the Secretary of State&#x2014;answerable to Parliament&#x2014;who discharges certain functions, who appoints the director, who discharges other functions, who appoints staff, subject to Treasury approval.<lb/>
Is it not much to be doubted whether administration by council in committee (where one-third of the members concerned with the making of decisions are members of recognised trade unions) could ever afford the type of administration requisite for the due and orderly exercise of functions and discharge of duties under this Bill? So far as I am aware, there is no precedent for setting up any such system as is envisaged by the amendment. Surely this cannot be the occasion on which to indulge in an unproven experiment.<lb/>
Particularly I oppose the introduction of the concept that the appointment of staff with Treasury consent may take place only after consultation with the trade unions. This seems to misunderstand the true nature and functions of trade unions and could only serve as a cause of friction if the views of the trade unions are not adopted. Provided there is consultation the provisions of Amendment No. 6 have no legal efficacy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00815"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: Amendment No. 6 is not covered by the present debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00816"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I am very much obliged to the noble Lord. With the Committee's leave, I should like to excise what I have just said about Amendment No. 6 and perhaps come to that, if necessary, if the amendment is moved later.<lb/>
I conclude with Amendment No. 12 which stands on its own. With the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, it does not really follow Articles 85 and 86, and it does not quite make sense, because the last alternative&#x2014;or in markets outside the
<col>226</col>
United Kingdom if it was to follow Articles 85 and 86&#x2014;should be limited to the territories of the Common Market. This would include China, the USA or wherever. That is not the point. I am not making a drafting point. I am trying to suggest that the concept of including this amendment is otiose, because Articles 85 and 86 apply in any event by decision of the Court of Justice. They apply to state enterprises, and the noble Lord knows the decisions, and to such an enterprise as this. They can operate, as the noble Lord knows, either on the complaint of any aggrieved party or by the Commission acting <i>ex officio.</i> Thus, with the utmost respect, I suggest that Amendment No. 12 is unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00817"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: I fear that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, has introduced objections to these amendments on a principle that is dear to his heart: that nothing should be done for the first time. However, leaving that aside, I fear that he has misconstrued the amendments in two serious respects. First, he has been talking as if the council proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, is to be a council of a body responsible for administration of British telecommunications. That is not the case. The council is to be of the Office of Telecommunications which, of its nature, is a body, small, deliberately compact and concerned with relations with a large variety of outside bodies, including trade unions but also, particularly, including existing and potential licencees.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00818"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged to the noble Lord for giving way. If he will look at Amendment No. 3, in its present form&#x2014;and I am not trying to take drafting points&#x2014;it is mandatory that the director shall refer to the council for decision any matters relating to the administration. It is on that interpretation, with the greatest respect to the noble Lord, that I think I am not mistaken about this. Maybe it is not what the movers of the amendment intend, but, as the amendment stands, I think that I am not mistaken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00819"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: The distinction that I was attempting to draw was between the administration of the office, a body of 50 people, and the administration of British Telecom, a body of nearly a quarter of a million people. That is the extent to which I was saying that the officers were concerned with the outside world and that internal administration surely will be a very minor part of its activities.<lb/>
If I may resume, the activities of the Office of Telecommunications will certainly involve the licensees; and they will involve the trade unions, the Government and the manufacturers and suppliers of equipment, both in this country and, almost certainly, outside this country. It is in that respect that I understood that the amendments meant that the appointment of a council&#x2014;a small, compact, hardworking council, I have no doubt&#x2014;would be of value to the director in helping him in those relations with the outside world.<lb/>
The second respect in which I fear that the noble Lord has misconceived the amendment is when he refers to the need for a firm hand in management. I take it that what he means here by "a firm hand" is an untrammelled hand in management, without, as he
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0122"/>
<col>227</col>
repeated, being obliged to refer various matters to the council for decision. The experience of British Telecom has been that the period during which the board of British Telecom had by statute seven trade union members as members of the board was a period of unparalleled success in management terms, in terms of financial results, in terms of investment and in terms of the adoption of new technology.<lb/>
It was only the accident of the division between the Post Office and the telecom business in 1979, and the determination of the Government not to continue with experiments in industrial democracy, that led to that experiment being terminated. It was certainly not through any failure of the experiment itself, and it was certainly not through any failure of the principle of having trade unions taking part in the management of an organisation. To that extent, too, I think that, although it is a minor change, perhaps, the amendments express something which it is worth the Government taking up and is worth being included in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00820"><member>Earl De La Warr</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a word about this in rather more general terms, which means that I shall confine what I say to Amendment No. 2. I am not concerned with the way the body is made up. I suppose that what we are really discussing is whether an extra ministerial body such as this one should consist of one man, as is proposed in the Bill and as we find in the case of the Director of Fair Trading, or whether we should go right to the other end of the spectrum&#x2014;and there is, of course, an existing "other end" of the spectrum, and that is the IBA, where there is a director general who is responsible for nearly all the decisions but who has a chairman and a non-executive board which meets regularly and to which he refers.<lb/>
I do not think that this is an easy decision. I have thought for some time that the DGT, as he is to be called, was going to be rather a lonely fellow. On the other hand, in an indirect way I have for many years had some considerable experience of the IBA, and I have to say that, on balance, I find that the decision-taking capability of a body like the IBA&#x2014;including that for fast decisions when they are necessary&#x2014;is cumbersome and frequently takes too long. Therefore, just from the point of view of expedient and competent management, after considering it very carefully, I would plump not for the IBA method but for the DGT on his own.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00821"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: I think it suffices to say that any large organisation in our country has something similar to the proposal that is being made by the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, in his amendment. What I find particularly nauseating, coming from the Benches opposite, is this. Whenever there are strikes and industrial unrest we on this side of the Committee are regaled and are pleaded with to look at the German system, where the Germans have, in both private and public industries, what they call their <i>Betriebsrat;</i> that is, the business advisers, to advise the director or chairman of a company or the person who is responsible for a state organisation. We have been told that it is about time that the British trade union movement had a look at this; that this is how it ought to be done.<lb/>
<col>228</col>
But the Government, when they drafted this Bill, forgot that advice which they are always giving us; and we, in our good socialist "confelicity" and liberal way of thinking, think that it is not fair that a Government which have always embraced this principle should now take it by the throat and strangle it. That is not a good way to start an organisation of this character. I would remind your Lordships that these debates will be read&#x2014;and I was absolutely shocked when I heard the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, describe it as (I am not quite sure of his expression) either vicious or odious; anyway, it was something which caused him displeasure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00822"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: Otiose in relation to a technical, legal amendment. It was nothing vicious.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00823"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: I must say that, as a layman, I, like the noble Lord, find all legal and technical amendments somewhat odious. Let us come down to the facts of the matter. I can understand Members opposite saying, "We did not really mean what we used to say about the German example, about having a form of collective security and sensible, intelligent discussion. We only meant that particular thing when there were strikes and when there were industrial disputes. We were using that German argument simply to lambast the Labour Party and the Liberal Party". That is not a particularly good way of working, either.<lb/>
When one hears the argument which, no doubt, will be submitted, as I think it was adumbrated by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway&#x2014;the argument of one-third of this advisory body representing a few hundred thousands of working people who will be engaged in this thing&#x2014;I can hear people saying: "What do the Labour and Liberal Parties mean? Are they telling us that, unlike we who always pay lip service to industrial democracy but who in no way are going to make it a reality, they intend to make it a reality with this amendment by Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran?" That is the point of conscience that has to enter every breast opposite if there is a Division on this; because, if not, they will have to be harried to the rack at every instance of unrest that can happen in our country. I hope there is none.<lb/>
Let us have a look to see whether there have been any examples of where this has actually happened and what contribution it has made. Let us take one which is very similar: namely, the Post Office Board. Does anyone deny that the Advisory Council, with more powers than we are proposing in this amendment, was a failure? It was lauded and praised by successive Ministers from both parties when they had responsibility. Why, when this principle has been so successful, has it suddenly to be discarded? This seems to me to be quite remarkable.<lb/>
I should like to close on one particular point. There is sometimes argument about representatives of the skilled craftsmen, technicians and professional people who go to work in this telecommunications organisation, giving advice to the General in charge. Indeed, speaking in parenthesis and looking at the arguments that we have heard, if this were applied to the Army and the Navy, all chiefs and their staffs would be sacked tomorrow morning. How daft the opposing arguments are about this proposal, because
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0123"/>
<col>229</col>
the idea has been proved. No one can contradict me when I say that in the Post Office Board, and in a number of other boards, such representatives have proved to be successful; and the figure of six is even a small number.<lb/>
The argument is: how can trade unionists, professional men, skilled artisans, on the one hand, look after the interests of their members and then sit on these boards? The answer is simple. Every responsible trade union leader detests any possibility of industrial unrest and knows full well, particularly in the public sector, that if the whole organisation is working as a team that means that the trade union representatives must be as much interested in the success of the organisation. By doing that they are contributing to the welfare and the satisfaction of their members, who are vital to any organisation. Therefore I beg Ministers and Members opposite to look at the quintessentials of this simple proposal. If it is no good and does not work it could be removed, but I believe it is of such proven value that at least we ought to start off with it and test it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00824">6.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00825"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: I support the Government on this matter. I have had misgivings, as probably all of us have, about the setting up of a new independent authority and I am worried about the overlapping between this authority and the Office of Fair Trading, which has been much quoted, by the RRD Department of the Home Office; and possibly the new cable authority in certain areas will be overlapping. So I think there will be a reshaping and possibly, over the next 10 or 20 years, a growth in the powers of this authority. Therefore I would not wish to saddle it at its birth with statutorily-laid-down members&#x2014;two of this, two of that and two of the other&#x2014;whom they should consult and who should be sitting on the council, and so on. I believe we would be much wiser to leave it to the authority as they begin to grow into their responsibilities. It is necessary in a high technology industry&#x2014;and in a developing high technology industry&#x2014;which they are going to be responsible for monitoring and policing to some extent, to have great flexibility so that the system can develop along the lines that are needed.<lb/>
I contemplated putting down an amendment suggesting that we ought to have a High Court judge as the director. I felt there ought to be, as I suggested at Second Reading, a High Court judge with Patent Bar experience, because I thought he would be numerate and would understand some of the technicalities. But I did not do that because I thought that, again, if that were in an amendment I would be limiting the choice. If it be possible to persuade somebody with great industrial experience to serve here, I think it would be perhaps even better than a High Court judge because you want somebody who has authority and has the respect of all the people with whom he is going to negotiate and deal.<lb/>
It is not going to be easy. One of the great problems of setting up organisations like this, or even of running the great nationalised industries, is to find leaders of adequate calibre who will go through all the hassle, the problems and the difficulties and who will serve
<col>230</col>
loyally. We find them, but it is not easy; and in this case I am not sure that the reward of 05,000&#x2014;which after average taxation will be about 17,000&#x2014;is going to match the need for all time. If it is to be limited to that, I think Parliament will have to be consulted and the amount would have to be adjusted in accordance with inflation, which of course will take off if the Party opposite by any chance should become the Government.<lb/>
So I think we should have flexibility. I do not believe that it is wise to limit the number of people on a council or to say exactly who they should represent. For that reason I decided not to put down an amendment suggesting that perhaps a deputy permanent secretary was not the ideal person, which I believe was contemplated. I agree that it would be much better if the person came from industry or from the law. But, above all, if we leave it as the Government have suggested&#x2014;flexible and without statutory obligations to any one commitment&#x2014;then it is very important that we should get the best and most influential director who really knows his job and can manage this new-born child and see that it undertakes the responsibilities which this Bill lays upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00826"><member>Lord Perry of Walton</member><membercontribution>: We on these Benches support these amendments; but we are debating first of all Amendment No. 2 and I should like to ask the Government not to consider all amendments together, because Amendment No. 2 simply asks for the appointment of a council. It leaves complete freedom as to the nature of that council, unless the further amendments are accepted together with it. I would therefore suggest that the Government accept Amendment No. 2 and bring forward at Report stage their own proposals to be debated at that time about the nature and shape of the council, if they cannot agree to the rest of the amendments today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00827"><member>Baroness Fisher of Rednal</member><membercontribution>: I want to speak particularly to Amendment No. 3, regarding any disputes that may be likely to arise, bearing in mind that one of the new directions which the director will be working under will be that of the responsibility for looking after the interests of the consumer. If one reads the Government handout, it says that one of the functions will be the receiving and considering of representations by consumers and other users of the telecommunication services.<lb/>
I feel quite strongly that this will be a cause of great conflict. On the one hand, we have the director having the responsibility of granting licences to telecommunication operators and also assuming the role of consumer watchdog. When we are considering anything to do with the Post Office and telecommunications, we have to remember the late Lord Peddie, who served in this Chamber for a considerable number of years. I remember him with great affection because he was one of the Peers who introduced me into this Chamber. He was a very active and highly-thought-of Chairman of POUNC.<lb/>
I have information from many sources that the POUNC was recognised as one of the very good consumer organisations, and for that to be destroyed is a very retrograde step, which the Government will
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0124"/>
<col>231</col>
take when they give responsibility to a director who is part and parcel of the organisation of the industry.<lb/>
I should like to remind the Government that only a few weeks ago the Water Bill was going through this House, and one of its important aspects was the role of the consumer consultative committees. It is important for the Government to remember that one of the important issues that were then faced was the fact that the guidelines for those committees had to be placed before Parliament. So it was felt, because of the loss of local government representation on the water boards, that consumer representation needed to be identified. We are in exactly the same position here. We are losing consumer representation, if the director is to take over the receiving and considering of representations by consumers and other users of telecommunications services.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, said, there will be an overlapping of the functions of the man who is in charge. The Secretary of State for Industry, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, consumer protection, fair trading and even, possibly, taking people to court will be involved. It is a very formidable task that this person will have. But this group of consumers, which means everybody, should have protection and it is for that reason that by Amendment No. 3 we ought to make sure that the council recognises that there is a great need for consumer protection and it must not be cast aside so easily, as the Government seem to be recommending in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00828"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: I wonder whether I might make a short contribution. I was very struck by the judicious comments made by the noble Earl, Lord De La Warr, and the noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, because it seemed to me that they had very carefully considered this problem and, on the whole, had inclined towards the view that there should be a single director in charge of this operation. I have had experience of running a fairly large organisation for many years, and I have also thought about this in the light of that experience. After the same careful thought as those noble Lords gave to this problem, I have come to the conclusion that, bearing in mind that this is a totally new experiment in a very large sector of industry, we would on balance be better advised to set up a council alongside the director general, so as to make people feel that there was full representation at the top of the body which would set the rules and see that they were carried out.<lb/>
This is an experiment of vital importance and there must be created a feeling of confidence that the body which will regulate the operation of this sector under these new rules will be such as to have been drawn from a number of sources, albeit to have presiding over it the director general, as is suggested in this amendment. But I believe that your Lordships ought very seriously to consider that aspect of creating confidence in the new body that is to be set up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00829">6.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00830"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: It might be appropriate if I reply to this amendment in the same way as the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, moved it: that is, to address myself to the general principles rather than to go through all the amendments one by one. May I take
<col>232</col>
first the question of whether there should be a council? I must confess that I was slightly puzzled to see that the noble Lord is proposing that the council should be in addition to the director and not instead of him. Several people have suggested the latter, usually arguing that it would be more appropriate to have a body like the Civil Aviation Authority, rather than an individual officer such as the director.<lb/>
I do not want to go into the arguments for and against each of these, since they are set out in detail in the explanatory note on Clause I that was circulated to your Lordships some days ago. But regardless of which model is the best&#x2014;and I must say that I myself firmly believe that the one we have in the Bill is the right one&#x2014;I am very doubtful of the merit of having both, for this seems to be duplicating the bureaucracy and a recipe for delay and over-administration.<lb/>
Turning now to the functions of the proposed council, what I think the noble Lord has in mind is that it should act as a sort of appeal body for the resolution of disputes between the director and, for example, a licensee. If this is so, perhaps I might explain why I believe that to be unnecessary and why I do not believe the procedures envisaged in these amendments would actually work.<lb/>
First, let me take the case where the dispute is over-administration or, perhaps more accurately, maladministration. I should like to point out that this is already covered by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration&#x2014;usually called the ombudsman. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 widens his ambit to include the director's activities. If the dispute concerns the actual performance of his functions by the director, then the director&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00831"><member>Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran</member><membercontribution>: I apologise for interrupting, but I was not pressing that aspect of the amendments. I was concentrating, as I thought the noble Lord was doing, only on Amendment No. 2 as to whether a council would be helpful for any purpose. As my noble friend Lord Ezra indicated, help would appear to be required and, therefore, we are considering only that aspect. I entirely agree with the noble Lord that there are difficulties about Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 and possibly 5, but I am not concerned with the details of the structure or scope of the council at the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00832"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I accept that that is what was in the noble Lord's mind. But other noble Lords have raised different points and I was seeking to reply to the debate altogether, so that I do not have to rise to my feet a dozen times between now and dinner. Let me say that I think it is sufficient that aggrieved persons should have access to the courts, if they believe that the director has failed to fulfil any of the duties in Clause 3, so it is unnecessary to provide a special council.<lb/>
But there are two further matters which puzzle me. If the council is to act as an appeal body about the performance or administration of the director's functions, it would be quite wrong for him to be its chairman. This would, in effect, make him judge, jury and defendant. Secondly, Amendment No. 3 empowers the director to refer disputes to the council for decision, but the other party has no such power. I
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0125"/>
<col>233</col>
do not think that the noble Lord could really have intended the arrangement to be as one-sided as that.<lb/>
I could raise a number of question marks, but I do not want to be on my feet forever. But may I just touch on one more, which is raised by Amendment No. 12? The effect of this, it seems to me, is to require the council to have regard to one, and only one, objective; namely, the promotion of competition. I, of course, wholly agree that this is very important but, as will be explained when we come to Clause 3, there are other factors to be considered when determining telecommunications policy and it would be wrong to concentrate upon one alone.<lb/>
May I finally turn to one or two points that I think were in the mind of my noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing? I do not think that he is now in his place, but perhaps I may just refer to them. My noble friend asked what sort of person the Director General of Telecommunications would be. This matter is in the mind of at least one noble Lord on the other side of the Committee. No decision has yet been taken, but I can assure your Lordships that whoever is appointed will be a person of considerable stature.<lb/>
The Government attach great importance to the job of the director, as must be obvious from the role we have already prescribed for him. Clearly he must be somebody of both knowledge and authority. We are determined that the appointee shall have those qualities. Parallels have been drawn with the Director General of Fair Trading. Indeed, the Government themselves have drawn those parallels. The last two directors general in that post, Sir John Methven and Sir Gordon Borrie, were very successful and set a very reassuring precedent. The salary will be tied, as I said, to that of a Second Permanent Secretary. Currently, that is &#x00A3;35,000. However, to answer my noble friend, that scale is reassessed from time to time.<lb/>
I hope I have said enough to convince your Lordships that we think that this is the wrong course to go down. I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord will not seek to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00833"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I seek to persuade your Lordships that it would be in the best interests of the Bill if the Committee supported Amendment No. 2, which stands in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran. It is quite clear that Clause 1 of the Bill reached its final form long before Clause 3 found its way to the other place. Clause 3 was drafted and put before the other place because of the general disapproval and distrust expressed in all parts of the other place as to the new set-up proposed by the Bill. All that Amendment No. 2 seeks to do is precisely to establish the degree of flexibility to which the noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, referred.<lb/>
In effect, this is a new tier of Government inside the telecommunications industry. The duties of the director general and of the Secretary of State had not been closely defined when the Bill first came before the other place. They were elaborated only when Clause 3 was introduced. Clause 3 includes a number of specific duties. One duty, however, escaped the Government. Clause 3 lays a joint responsibility on both the Secretary of State and the new director. In certain
<col>234</col>
respects their responsibilities are absolutely identical. What will happen if the resonable interpretation by the director of, in particular, subsection (2) of Clause 3 differs from that of the Secretary of State? However intelligent, however purposeful the Secretary of State may be&#x2014;or, for that matter, the director general&#x2014;I cannot see that an identity of viewpoint, an identity of attitude towards the carrying out of the specific functions of Clause 3 can be guaranteed. The director general is, in one sense, a tier alongside the Government, because he has identical responsibilities to those of the Secretary of State. This is a tier above the ordinary business administration of British Telecom. In many respects his position is analogous, even though his duties and responsibilities are carefully defined, to that of the chief executive of a very large holding company.<lb/>
If we carry the principle of personal, individual control too far, shall we not run the risk of confirming what many people already think, with abundant justification&#x2014;that some of the boards of big public companies are grossly inflated by having what, broadly speaking, is the equivalent of a council? But a council consisting of six members (two of whom are members of trade unions) for consultative purposes&#x2014;in order to sound out views, or to reinforce one's own views, or dissent from them, or to pass observations on the views of the Secretary of State if the views of the Secretary of State quite honestly differ from those of the director general in the application of Clause 3&#x2014;would be a very sensible way of dealing with this matter. Those who are in positions of public or commercial, professional or industrial responsibility find it very helpful to be able to talk aloud at the level of those with whom they normally confer&#x2014;say, a board of directors or, as in this case, a council.<lb/>
I have very grave reservations about the establishment of this further tier of administration. I dissent from it completely. The country considers that the whole Bill is a complete waste of time, anyway. Amendment No. 1 has been defeated; but, on the assumption that a director general will be appointed, surely it is a matter of common sense that he ought to be assisted by a council of the type proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran.<lb/>
I appeal to your Lordships to be reasonable. There is no party dogma about this amendment. It is a matter of sound business, commercial and professional experience. It is a matter of everyday common sense. I warn noble Lords on the Government side that there is no unanimity in the country on this question. I shall not regale your Lordships with what the <i>Economist,</i> which is by no means friendly towards either the Liberal-SDP Alliance or the Labour Party, said about the matter on 23rd April. It is one of the most pungent criticisms of Government that I have read for some time and I would suggest that the Committee should heed it. I appeal to noble Lords, who have a degree of independence since they are not dependent upon selection for a constituency, to assert that independence and to insist upon common sense being paid some heed.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Property (Discharge of Mortgage by Receipt)<lb/> (Northern Ireland) Order 1983</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00842">7.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00843"><member>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (The Earl of Gowrie)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 19th April be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00844">The noble Earl said: My Lords, before I turn to the details of the order I should like quickly to refer to the role played by the Northern Ireland Assembly in the consultative process. On 13th December last year my right honourable friend the Secretary of State referred the proposal for this order to the Assembly for consideration and comment. The report of the Assembly's careful deliberations, which fully supports the change in legislation propounded in the order, has been laid before your Lordships' House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00845">The purpose of this short but important piece of legislation is to simplify the manner in which mortgages in Northern Ireland may be discharged. The order contains just one substantive article, Article 3, which sets out the main principle underlying the order&#x2014;that a receipt is sufficient to discharge the mortgage and revest the property. The article further provides in paragraph (3) that the receipt shall be given in the form set out in the schedule, and paragraphs (4) and (5) prescribe certain requirements for the receipt. Paragraph (6) provides for registration of the receipt in the Registry of Deeds.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00846">The order will be of benefit to the public and to the legal profession: to the former because it will provide a cheaper method of discharge; to the latter because it will replace a cumbersome method of working with a simpler one. It has been warmly welcomed by those bodies which will be directly affected by it&#x2014;the solicitors' profession and the main banks which carry on business in Northern Ireland. A number of useful technical drafting amendments, made by commentators, have been incorporated into the order since it was published as a proposal. None of the changes affected the substance of the order.</p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0127"/>
<col>237</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00847">My Lords, at a time when the mortgage marketplace is no longer the sole preserve of the building societies, as banks and other financial institutions have begun to enter this arena, it is right that the method of discharging mortgages be uniform across the board. This the order achieves. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00848">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 19th April be approved.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Gowrie.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00849"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I thank the noble Earl for explaining the purpose of the order, and say briefly that we welcome it for four reasons: first, as the noble Earl said, it was brought before the Assembly&#x2014;we are pleased to note that&#x2014;and they gave it approval; secondly, there were consultations with the professional bodies concerned; thirdly, I understand it will bring the Northern Ireland law on this matter into line with that appertaining in England and Wales; and fourthly (possibly as important as any), it will bring a cheaper and simpler system of revesting property. For those four reasons we welcome the order.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Rates (Amendment No. 2) (Northern Ireland)<lb/> Order 1983</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00851">7.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00852"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Rates (Amendment No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1983, a draft of which was laid before your Lordships on 19th April 1983, be approved.<lb/>
The order is both short and simple. It sets out to do just one thing: to extend industrial de-rating in Northern Ireland from the present level of 75 per cent. to 100 per cent. Your Lordships will recall that my noble friend Lord Ferrers announced in this House on 23rd March a new and integrated package of industrial incentives to stimulate industrial growth and maintain industrial employment in the unique situation of severe economic and social problems which besets Northern Ireland. The present order provides for the legislative adjustment needed to give effect to the rating element of the new economic initiative.<lb/>
The effect of the order is limited to that sector which already benefits from industrial de-rating in Northern Ireland; it is not concerned with the service sector, with shops, offices and so on, or with any other sector. The Government are still considering these and other aspects of rating in the United Kingdom as a whole in the context of the very extensive consultations which took place on the proposals of the Green Paper on <i>Alternatives to Domestic Rates,</i> which was published in December 1981. The House will wish to be assured that industrial de-rating, whether at the present or at the proposed higher level, does not mean bigger rate bills for other ratepayers. The cost of 100 per cent. de-rating, estimated at &#x00A3;7 million in the 1983&#2013;84 rating year, in addition to the estimated &#x00A3;21 million which would accrue from de-rating at the existing level of 75 per cent., will in fact continue to be met from within existing Exchequer allocations to Northern Ireland services. The change does not, therefore, have the effect of increasing public spending in Northern Ireland. The local authorities will continue to be paid
<col>238</col>
compensatory grant in respect of deprivation of national rate revenue which would accrue to them if industrial de-rating did not exist.<lb/>
I apologise to your Lordships that the order is presented without the usual period for consultation. The contents of the new industrial incentives package were made final only in late March, and if the impact of the new de-rating concession is to be maximised it is essential that it should be available as soon as possible. The new rating year has already started, and I am therefore seeking the approval of your Lordships for retrospection of the effect of the order to 1st April this year. Your Lordships will, I hope, acknowledge that the order is modest enough in length and in content. Its single purpose is to enhance the rating inducement to existing industry to stay and to new industry to establish itself in Northern Ireland. I commend the order to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00853">Moved, That the Rates (Amendment No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 be approved.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Gowrie.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00854"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, once again I thank the noble Earl for explaining the order. I note that this again was one of the recommendations from the Assembly when they considered the whole question of industrial development incentives. When the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, repeated a Statement in your Lordships' House I said that there was need to consider whether the proposals for de-rating and corporation tax were the right ones. What there is general agreement upon is that there is a pressing need, and I recall that on that occasion I drew the attention of your Lordships to the fact that there are more persons unemployed in Northern Ireland than there are at present engaged in manufacturing industry. Since then I have noted in a Written Answer to a Question in another place that male unemployment has reached 25.4 per cent., and of course we know that in some areas it is about 50 per cent. Therefore, undoubtedly something needs to be done.<lb/>
We on these Benches would have wished to see some action on the lines proposed by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions, but if this proposal to give industrial de-rating up to 100 per cent. will help to bring in new investment, if it will assist existing concerns to maintain their position, then we give that a qualified welcome, and we readily understand the point made by the noble Earl regarding retrospection.<lb/>
I hope the noble Earl can give an assurance that this provision for 100 per cent. industrial de-rating will not be taken as a precedent for any extension of de-rating to England and Wales. Northern Ireland has had the special facility up till now of 75 per cent. de-rating. The only other de-rating that is applicable in the United Kingdom is that in Scotland, where it is 50 per cent.; but there is no de-rating for industrial premises in England and Wales, and we would hope that this will in no way prejudice the position and create a precedent to introduce that sort of de-rating into England and Wales without full consideration of the whole rating situation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Telecommunications Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00857">7.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00858">Committee stage resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00859">[<i>Amendments Nos. 3 to 5 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00860"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member> moved Amendment No. 6:
<quote>Page 2, line 20, at end insert ("and after consultation with the appropriate trade unions")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00861">The noble Lord said: It is a peculiarity of the way in which the Bill is organised that subjects of very great moment appear to be introduced at the outset of this Committee stage on matters which appear to be relatively trivial, but the issues which are raised, even by these perhaps minor matters of the composition and administration of the Office of Telecommunications, do have harmonics which will undoubtedly reverberate (if that is the right word for harmonics) later in the Bill. We come with Amendment No. 6 to an issue&#x2014;the issue of the consultation with the appropriate trade unions&#x2014;which has very considerable importance throughout the later stages of the Bill and to which we shall undoubtedly be making future reference.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00862">It is not quite so unimportant as the Government would have us believe. Ministers in another place pretended to think, or may indeed genuinely have thought, that a comparable amendment put down there was simply a matter of terms and conditions of service. The assurance was given by a Minister in the other place that the terms and conditions of service of the staff of the Office of Telecommunications would be comparable with those of the Civil Service. I am quite sure that that assurance was accepted by my honourable friends there. Indeed, the noble Baroness, the Leader of the House, said in response to a Question this afternoon that industrial relations in the Civil Service are good. I would not attempt to deny that. But the issue here in this clause and in the amendment is much wider than the issue of the terms and conditions of service. It is about the appointment of staff and about the very complex range of subjects which the Office of Telecommunications and the Director General of Telecommunications will have to deal with with their relatively small staff.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00863">Just as in Amendment No. 2 it was urged from the Opposition Benches, and from the Liberal Benches in particular, that under these circumstances the director general ought surely to have as much help as he can in dealing with these complex issues with the outside world, so I argue that it is highly desirable that the director, in formulating his own staffing policy, should consult with the relevant trade unions. This may be something which is totally unprecedented. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, is not here to object to it on those grounds, and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, would not dream of objecting to it on those grounds. The fact that it may be unprecedented is not an argument for not trying it here.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00864">I say that with particular reference to the telecommunications industry. In the telecommunications industry, on consultation, cooperation between management and trade unions and participation by the trade unions in the management
<col>240</col>
of the Post Office (which was the case in those two years of the experiment to which I have referred up until 1979), the record is first class. It has gone together with good management. It has gone together with commercial and technological success and advancement. It has gone together with a vast expansion in the service provided, with only a very small increase in the numbers of people employed for the purpose. Surely if ever there was to be a case for starting correctly at the beginning, even in this minor way, and having the trade unions involved in initially establishing the Office of Telecommunications, it should be on this occasion, and in this industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00865">As I have said, it is not simply a matter of the terms and conditions. We must consider those who are experienced in the Civil Service unions and in the telecommunications unions, those who are experienced in the telecommunications industry and in the complexity of Government control of that industry, which no doubt we shall be referring to later this evening and on days to come. Such people will, I am sure, feel that the experience gained by the trade unions over the years ought to be shared with the Director of Telecommunications as he makes his decisions about staff and as he represents his views to the Treasury about numbers of staff and terms and conditions of service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00866">As I say, this may appear to be a minor matter, but in fact it is a question of starting correctly in the way that we mean to go on. It is also a question of treating the industry&#x2014;and all sides of it&#x2014;with the respect which it has come to deserve and which in the past has been shown to be so successful. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00867"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: In rising to support my noble friend who has moved the amendment I make only two points. The first is that I am glad that he has made it quite clear that the addition of the words contained in his amendment applies to the phrase "as to numbers" just as much as to the phrase,
<quote>"as to terms and conditions of service".</quote>
That was certainly my reading of the amendment, and it seemed to tally with what my noble friend has in mind. It is desirable that the trade unions should be consulted specifically under the provisions of the Bill not only on terms and conditions, which is obvious, but also on wider considerations of staffing policy. That is the first reason why I support my noble friend's amendment.<lb/>
My other reason is also in line with what my noble friend has said, and here I wish to reiterate a point that I made on Second Reading. Lest any Conservative members of your Lordships' Committee should be in fear and trembling whenever the words "trade unions" are introduced into our discussions, I can assure them that in this particular case we are dealing with trade unions which have a long record of responsible trade union action. As I put it at Second Reading, within the spectrum of TUC membership they are among the most reliable and responsible of trade unions. I believe that because of the record which my noble friend has spelled out, as well as on grounds of general principle, these trade unions are entitled to have the amendment written into the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0129"/>
<col>241</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00868">8.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00869"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I am not quite clear how the noble Lord sees the amendment working in practice. Who would decide which were the "appropriate" trade unions? The assumption must be that it would be for the director to interpret that. In any event, however this question is decided, I think that the amendment is undesirable. Of course I appreciate the noble Lord's concern about the need to consult trade unions about manning levels. But, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has already indicated, he appreciates Oftel's staff will be civil servants, and there already exist long-established procedures for consultation on all the matters to which he referred in his opening remarks. Terms and conditions of service, including salaries, are agreed centrally. To add a further level of consultation would at best be unnecessary, and I submit might also undermine existing procedures.<lb/>
I really believe that there is nothing between the noble Lord and me on this matter. We both agree that the objectives which he has described are desirable; but I suggest that they are already achieved by the arrangements at present in place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00870"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I hope that the words of the noble Lord the Minister on this particular aspect of the Bill are not his last on the subject. I do not know whether those who framed the Bill as originally presented in another place had any real concept of what they were doing, other than presenting the various finance houses within the city with a very good opportunity to make large sums of money. This is of course implicit in privatisation.<lb/>
I have before me the accounts of British Telecom, which show in extended form the results over the past six or seven years. If at any point the noble Lord wishes to challenge me and say where British Telecom has proved to be below the standard of efficiency and service to which the Government very often pay at any rate some lip service, I should be very glad to be reproached, and indeed to be cross-examined on the financial results shown in the accounts.<lb/>
The noble Lord surely must realise&#x2014;as I believe the country realises&#x2014;that the entire fortunes of British Telecom over the years, with the progressive improvements that have been effected within it, have in the main been the result of very dedicated effort by highly specialised technicians, scientists, and engineers, as well of course as some other employees who do not have functions which call for such high qualifications. One is not dealing with the trade unions in the form which is very often imaginatively put forward by Mr. Tebbit. One is dealing with people with intellectual abilities and work qualifications much higher than those of Mr. Tebbit himself, and probably higher than even those of the Secretary of State referred to in the Bill.<lb/>
Over the years the people to whom I refer have been responsible for the entire conduct of British Telecom's affairs and have played the main part in its continued success. They belong to their respective trade unions, according to their particular vocations as scientists, engineers, technicians, or whatever they may be. They know what the Government do not know. They know how the industry runs. They know its functions, its real needs, and its day-to-day work. They are not subject to
<col>242</col>
the periodical political arbitrament of elections. They have their vocations to which they dedicate themselves and in which they work. They are a fine body of men. The qualifications of many of them&#x2014;technically, scientifically, and administratively&#x2014;exceed those held by any member of the present Government. Any insult that can be&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00872"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I shall give way to the noble Earl in a moment, when I have completed my sentence. If the noble Lord the Minister can think of any greater insult to these people than that their unions&#x2014;which they support&#x2014;should not even be consulted, then he in turn is insulting them. If the noble Lord looks at his own speech again, although he said&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00873"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has, I fear, become the victim of a misapprehension. We are talking about the staff of Oftel, not that of British Telecom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00874"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I agree. The noble Lord makes my point. If the noble Lord reads those matters set out in Clause 3 of the Bill which the director, now a lone individual with no council to consult, is required to deal with, is it conceivable that he should proceed upon the whole business of making appointments of the staff he requires in order to enable him to deal with his various functions under Clause 3 and elsewhere without consulting the trade unions? No-one disputes the right (I use the term colloquially) of the manager to rule. Non-one disputes the right of the director general, after interview and after examining the CVs of the various applicants for the task, to appoint whoever he wishes. No-one disputes his right and, indeed, his duty, within the parameters of Clause 3 and elsewhere, to have a rough idea or to put forward some rough proposals&#x2014;he has no council to which he can put them&#x2014;on the staffing and the qualifications that he needs.<lb/>
We shall come back to this super-person and the qualifications that he individually requires at a later stage. But can anyone&#x2014;an ordinary businessman, a professional man or an industrialist&#x2014;in his right mind, really think that the advice of the council of trade unions in devising the parameters and the staffing would not be of value? The amendment does not say that the director general has to accept any kind of <i>diktat,</i> or anything of that kind. He alone, without the council, is responsible ultimately for doing what he has to do in the appointment of his staff.<lb/>
I begin to feel sorry for the Government and this pitiable little Bill. I would have thought, once again, that it is plain common sense to consult with the appropriate trade unions. I do not know why Her Majesty's Government seem bent on putting every trade unionist in the country into <i>purdah</i> as some untouchable type. I agree that there is the fashionable Thatcher-Tebbit philosophy that, of course, despises and hates all trade unionism.</membercontribution></p>

<col>243</col>
Conservative Benches. I would have thought that the amendment was a very reasonable one, and something that ordinary prudent people would do. Do the Government want this industry to function in an atmosphere of complete antagonism? I agree that, like The <i>Economist,</i> most of the responsible unions involved in British Telecom regard the Bill as a complete nonsense. They have expressed hostility towards it. But there is no doubt that their collective wisdom, accumulated over the years, would be of assistance to this "lone ranger" who is to be appointed&#x2014;at a salary, I understand, of &#x00A3;35,000 a year&#x2014;in making up his mind on his staffing arrangements. Why do the Government bother to resist? It is ridiculous.<lb/>
The noble Lord may speak to his brief, which has been prepared in the usual way along the lines of "The Minister might say", "The Minister will argue", or whatever those things are that are immortalised in the programme "Yes, Minister". However, as a matter of common sense, does he really believe in the argument he puts forward when he says that he understands what my noble friend Lord McIntosh says and that there is not all that much between them? If there is not all that much between them, why does he not accept the amendment? There is no <i>diktat</i> in it beyond the statutory responsibility to consult. It is a very reasonable amendment. I will now give way. I apologise to the noble Earl, but he interrupted my flow of argument.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00877"><member>Earl De La Warr</member><membercontribution>: Has the noble Lord finished, or am I interrupting him? I realised where I differed from the noble Lord when he asked if it would not be prudent to discuss these things with the right people. Of course it would. The noble Lord and myself are both businessmen. He runs a large professional firm; I ran a large industrial undertaking. Of course we took advice. Did we not quietly go and have a drink&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00878"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: Is the noble Earl inviting me to interrupt his interruption?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00879"><member>Earl De La Warn</member><membercontribution>:&#x2014;in my case with David Basnett and, in his case, I do not know with whom. I do not want to confine this to trade unions. Of course we take advice. But does the noble Lord not think advice is sometimes more useful when you take it of your own volition and not because an Act of Parliament says that you have to do so and because the people you take it from know that you are bound to ask for it? Why do we not leave some things to the good sense of this lonely fellow, the director general, instead of trying to guide his everyday steps by telling him he must do this and that? I think that this is the weakness in what the noble Lord says. I feel quite strongly about it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00880"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Earl. I invite the noble Earl to examine Clause 3 of the Bill carefully. As the noble Earl knows, it was only introduced under pressure and as an afterthought in another place. He will find that precise functions have been laid down.<lb/>
I do not know about the noble Earl's experience. My experience, at any rate in parliamentary life, which
<col>244</col>
extends over some time in another place and here, is that power can tend to corrupt and that unless certain duties and responsibilities are imposed on people they are likely to behave irresponsibly. I am not saying that the Secretary of State, in his appointment (if, indeed, the Secretary of State, as distinct from the Prime Minister, appoints the director general), will appoint the wrong man to the job, or anything of that kind. I am not saying that the individual concerned would not possess all those high professional, commercial and industrial qualifications that would commend themselves to the noble Earl, Lord De La Warr. I am saying that, in the same way that one has given both the Secretary Of State and the new director certain specific duties&#x2014;we shall seek to give him more at a later stage of the Bill&#x2014;so this ordinary elementary duty to consult with the appropriate trade unions should be specified. I am fortified in that belief by what the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has himself stated. The noble Lord will recall that he made a Statement in the House a few days ago on the Alvey Report. I asked him whether in this particular matter and in the consultations that took place afterwards he had consulted with the trade unions. The noble Lord replied, "We sent the TUC a copy".<lb/>
That is indicative of the Government's attitude at present not only towards the trade union movement as a whole, which they have caricatured so far quite successfully&#x2014;how successfully we shall see&#x2014;but also towards some of the highest qualified and responsible people within the whole of the telecommunications industry who themselves have been responsible for the great developments that have taken place scientifically, commercially and industrially in the telecommunications industry over the past 10 or 20 years.<lb/>
If the noble Lord wishes to persist and declines to accept this amendment, he will have automatically created a different climate within which this Bill, if it ever comes into operation, will ultimately have to function. He will be telling the trade union movement and all those technical people in it&#x2014;scientists and graduates of all kinds&#x2014;that he is treating them on the same basis as he treated them dismissively in the case of the Alvey Report, a copy of which was sent to the TUC in lieu of consultation. If the noble Lord thinks that this is good for the future development of the telecommunications industry, that is his affair &#x2014;indeed, it is the affair of the whole Government.<lb/>
I am trying to help the noble Lord as best I can based on my own professional, commercial and industrial experience. The noble Lord is making a very great mistake. I am trying to prevent him from injuring himself. Why does he persist in being masochistic about it? All he has to do is the reasonable thing. Unfortunately most of his colleagues are not on the Benches opposite to listen to the arguments that I am deploying. I have no doubt that as and when a Division comes he can rely on their support because they have not listened to the arguments. Even if they had done so perhaps their party loyalties exceed their regard for the national interest.<lb/>
This is, in a way, a very small point; but, in another way, it is a very big point indeed and I invite the noble Lord to reconsider it before he forces us into the Division Lobby against him.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>"subject to the approval of the Treasury &#x2026; as to terms and conditions of service".</quote>
The Minister has said that these terms and conditions would be exactly the same as those centrally negotiated for the whole of the rest of the Civil Service. Do those words mean precisely that, or do they mean that they are subject only to a general approval? It is important to understand that, if they mean precisely that, then the terms and conditions of service will have been negotiated in various joint industrial councils, and as such would have been laid before trade union representatives. I should like to be quite clear about this because I am not at present.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00883"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: If I may intervene at this point, I can answer the noble Viscount in the affirmative on that particular matter. As I understand it, the Treasury are responsible for approving the terms and conditions of all civil servants. The employment and the terms and conditions of all civil servants are subject to Treasury approval and this form of words has been put into the Bill so that the terms that would be approved would be identical to those agreed for all other civil servants in parallel grades.<lb/>
I turn to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. It seemed to me that the noble Lord was running out of arguments in favour of the proposals now before the Committee because most of his speech was concerned with personal invective against my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Industry&#x2014;and more latterly I think that all Members of the present Government came in for the noble Lord's verbal lash. But that is not the issue at this particular moment. What your Lordships are being asked to consider is the terms of the amendment on the Marshalled List.<lb/>
The proposal which the movers of this amendment, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, seek to put before the Committee at this juncture, is a proposal which is wholly and utterly without any type of precedent in the whole of the public service so far as I can understand it. There is no provision for the unions to be formally consulted in connection with&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00885"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Just a moment, please. There is no provision for the formal consultation machinery with so-called appropriate trade unions in respect of the appointments to any of the public bodies of which I am aware. I stand open to correction if the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, can think of a parallel body; but, so far as I know, there is none.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00886"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord said that this is without precedent, as he understands it. His saving grace is, "as he understands it". Those of us who have been involved for 30 and 40 years in this form of organisation know how totally and absolutely
<col>246</col>
incorrect his statement was. His saving grace is that he said "as he understands it". He should now get up and say, "as he misunderstands it".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00887"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I am not going to rise to that sort of proposal. What I am saying is that there is no formal consultative machinery, as is proposed in this amendment, in any of the other public bodies of which I am aware. If the noble Lord can think of one then of course I shall give way and hear what he has to say, and if I am wrong I shall immediately withdraw.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00888"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Lord. The noble Lord said that it is without precedent. Will he agree that we are dealing with a situation that is without precedent? We are dealing with the case of a highly successful industry that is being privatised. This is a situation without precedent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00889"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: No, the noble Lord is not quite correct. We are considering here the appointments to a regulatory body. That is a very different matter from the appointments to a public corporation or, less still, a private corporation. I stand by what I said: appointments to public bodies, especially regulatory bodies such as this, are not the subject of formal consultative procedures with the trade unions involved or, as I think the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, appeared to imply, almost any trade union that might have some distant interest in the matter. That is not to say that there will not be informal consultations, as we have already discussed in other contexts and at great length. However, if I may say so, I do hope that the noble Lord will not continue to mar the tone of this debate with a number of personal references, as he did earlier on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00890"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: We must look at the amendment in its context and how it will read as an addendum to Part I of the Bill. Subsection (5) reads:
<quote>"The Director may appoint such staff as he may think fit, subject to the approval of the Treasury".</quote>
Everything has to be subject to the approval of the Treasury. That is where the power is in this island of ours&#x2014;it is in the Treasury. And yet we allow little things like this to slip by. I want someone on the Benches opposite to tell me right now who elected these moguls to the Treasury and gave them such massive power. All Governments are guilty of it. It is about time that we realised that they have to adhere to the rules of Parliament as much as anyone else.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00891"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: It is of course Ministers in the Treasury who formally take the decisions to which I have referred. As the noble Lord will be aware, when a matter such as this comes before the Treasury it is a Minister in the Treasury who takes the decision on the advice, no doubt, of his officials. However, it is the Minister who takes the decision.<lb/>
Let me make one additional point. The noble Lord said that the Treasury rules all our lives. I am sometimes tempted to agree with him. However, the fact of the matter is that in past years&#x2014;and I am not saying just under the previous Labour Administration but under previous Administrations of every complexion&#x2014;there has not been sufficient adherence to some of the appropriate dictums of the Treasury or in any event to some decent disciplines. I think that in recent years we have paid the price for that.</membercontribution></p>

<col>247</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00892"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: I accept what the noble Lord has said. Therefore, I hope that they will accept an amendment to make it transparently clear to the people of this land that it is the Ministers at the Treasury, because this Bill does not say so and so long as it remains in this form, it is inaccurate. So that must be made clear some time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00893"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry, but I must correct the noble Lord again. The procedure in this matter&#x2014;and I speak from some experience in these matters&#x2014;is that when Treasury approval for something such as this is sought, that approval is not regarded as valid unless it is issued by the Minister concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00894"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: That may very well be so. I am trying to say that the ordinary people who are the bosses&#x2014;not the Treasury, not Ministers or moguls&#x2014;have a right to know what these nuances are. As a former staff side chairman of Whitley Councils, I was always appalled at the contributions to debates that senior civil servants could make without any authority of the Minister, who was sometimes sitting there, and we had to challenge the Minister to put some of these people in their place. I am hoping that those days are over and that that has passed.<lb/>
The probability is that very many people know who the Chancellor of Exchequer is and they know who the Financial Secretary is. If they do not, they receive a copy of <i>Hansard</i> once a month and find out. I do not even know who the Permanent Secretary is or all those who sit around him. So this needs to be made transparently clear.<lb/>
I now wish to continue with what I was saying. The Bill says:
<quote>"(5) The Director may appoint such staff as he may think fit, subject to the approval of the Treasury as to numbers and as to terms and conditions of service",</quote>
and if we add the amendment, it simply says:
<quote>"and after consultation with the appropriate trade unions.".</quote>
What can be wrong with that? Let me put it in other words: after consultation with the appropriate representatives of the thousands of professional and skilled people who are going to work in this particular sector. For example, that little phrase means that there will probably be represented 23,800 members of the Society of Telecom Executives. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with all these men learning their trade&#x2014;and many of them are the products of our universities&#x2014;and being asked to contribute to the smooth running of this new organisation?<lb/>
As I have said, I really cannot understand the attitude of the Government. I am vehemently and passionately opposed to everything in this Bill; but I still think that in a democratic society it behoves me and, for example, my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington, even to make suggestions which would improve the Bill. In this country we have been at this business of democracy for a very long time, and I frankly and freely admit that people from other parts of Europe cannot quite understand our procedures.<lb/>
Why should the Labour, Liberal and SDP opposition be trying to improve the Bill, to make sure that their contribution will make the whole operation smoother, when they ought to be opposing it tooth and nail? Here we are&#x2014;and this involves Her Majesty's Opposition in this House, the Liberal Party and the
<col>248</col>
SDP&#x2014;all supporting a proposition which involves representations of thousands of skilled men and women, without whose full support the measure will collapse. Anyone looking on would say that we on this side of the Committee must be barmy, why do we not try to wreck the Bill, why do we not try to make sure that there will not be any professional representation, that there will be one dictator? Then when the director is appointed, with massive power given to him by the Conservative Party to rule over everybody, the trouble will start.<lb/>
An outsider could be excused for thinking that that ought to be our attitude, but that is not our attitude. By these amendments, our attitude is to make certain that the principle and the spirit of the democratic structure of publicly-owned and partially publicly-owned industries are maintained. In addition to the 23,800 members in the management of British Telecommunications at the moment, there are many other thousands of trade unionists. The only reason I can imagine why the Government are not prepared to accept these amendments is that they will not take the risk that within perhaps months of this Bill becoming law and this organisation being set up, we shall see the headlines from <i>The Times</i> to the <i>Daily Express,</i> "Trouble, Anarchy, Strikes"&#x2014;unofficial and otherwise&#x2014;in this new organisation.<lb/>
We are saying that that is not a good way to start, even with an organisation which we believe does not exist. But we are practical people; we know that it has to be established. Of course, the Prime Minister may decide otherwise and go to the country before this measure can become law despite, as I read in the newspapers, the appeals made by the Leader of this House. If she loses, we get the best of both worlds. We do not get this rotten Bill and we get rid of a rotten Government.<lb/>
Nevertheless, despite that, we are making propositions to improve the most vital part of any industrial organisation. If the Minister were to talk to any experienced member of the Confederation of British Industry, he would say that it is vital in any new organisation&#x2014;particularly one that is technically and technologically involved to a high degree&#x2014;that we get our personnel relationship as near to perfect as we can. To do that we must say to people, "Come and be part of the team". As I have always understood it&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00895"><member>Earl De La Warr</member><membercontribution>: If the noble Lord will allow me, I think that he (and I have to say that he is not the only one) is getting way beyond this particular point of what the DGT does before he decides on the appointment of the members of his regulatory authority. The noble Lord is ranging over a huge number of questions and it is destroying what could be a very good little debate.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00898"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: It has huge threats; it has huge possibilities. Not for one sentence have I gone away from the need to ensure that there is proper teamwork. What is wrong with that? Are Members of the Committee opposite against teamwork in this industry? Their silence is the answer. That is the basis
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0133"/>
<col>249</col>
from which I am arguing. Where do you get this teamwork? It comes from the technicians, the high technologists, right the way through to the other aspects of the trade union movement&#x2014;their representatives; so that the director general with, if you like, his top staff, can call on these people to make this proposal a great success. That is what we are asking. I am of the opinion, and I am going to say it, that secretly any member of the CBI, any industrial director with knowledge of industrial relations, would be with us one hundred per cent. So would the trade unions. Why not the Government?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00900"><member>Baroness Lockwood</member><membercontribution>: I wonder whether we can draw a distinction between the meaning of two parts of this particular clause. The clause talks about the numbers and the terms and conditions of service. The terms and conditions are determined, as the Minister has rightly said, at national level, but that is the terms and conditions of particular grades. Surely what we are talking about in this particular clause and the amendment is the numbers at particular levels. It would seem appropriate, when we are establishing a new and important organisation such as this, that the appropriate trade union should be consulted about the numbers at different levels, and therefore the terms and conditions which would apply to those levels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00901"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I am disinclined to try to extend this debate much longer. That is for others if they seek to do so, not for me. We are basing this new body on the form that was agreed, and I believe widely welcomed even on Benches opposite, when we set up the Director General of Fair Trading and his office a few years ago. That was a proposal which was welcomed on all sides of your Lordships' House and in another place. The procedures that we are now adopting are procedures modelled closely on the procedures agreed at that time.<lb/>
What the amendment seeks to do is to set up a wholly new and unique consultative process for this body, and for this body alone. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, just now, there is no parallel for the proposals now before your Lordships in any of the other regulatory bodies in our entire public life. I say that with certainty and with conviction, but naturally I stand open to correction if noble Lords opposite can think of any such body.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00902"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: In the 1947 Act creating British Rail, in the creation of the public ownership of the air services, and then finally when the public ownership of the steel industry was brought about, a very similar procedure was adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00903"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I said "regulatory bodies". I was careful to use those particular words. I do not think that any of the organisations which the noble Lord refers to would fall into that category. We have had a longish debate on this matter. It is not for me to say when such a debate should be drawn to a close, and there is at least one noble Lord who certainly ought to intervene before we reach a conclusion on this matter, but I put it to your Lordships that what is proposed is
<col>250</col>
a wholly new and different consultative process which would not, I think, be in the interests of the smooth working of this organisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00904"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: In spite of the discouragement of the Minister, may I try to make three short points in support of the propositions of the noble Lords, Lord Molloy and Lord Bruce of Donington? First, surely if precedent is to be the test in these matters, it is quite inappropriate. I speak as a member of a profession which, without precedent, was frequently unable either to move backwards or forwards. If precedent is to be the test, it is quite the wrong test.<lb/>
The second point is that these matters under subsection (5) of Clause 1 are subject both as to numbers and terms and conditions of service to the approval of the Treasury. What that means is that the Treasury has a veto, or what the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, referred to rather picturesquely as "the dead hand of the Treasury". I am sure that is a very unfair approach to the Treasury's problems and the problems of Ministers who are responsible for the Treasury. Nevertheless it seems to me extraordinary that, having given this veto to the Treasury, the Government refuse to accept consultation&#x2014;not a veto&#x2014;with the trade unions.<lb/>
The Minister&#x2014;and this completes my point&#x2014;spoke rather critically (there is no reason why we should not be critical in this Committee from one side or the other) of the invective of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. Speaking for myself, I am not surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, was a bit "invective", if that is the right word, in this context, when here we have a situation in which the Government, having given the power of veto to the Treasury, refuse even to accept consultation with the trade unions.<lb/>
I accept the wisdom of what the noble Earl, Lord De La Warr, said in this context. It was obviously wise and it may be more sensible just to have these consultations informally rather than put them into a statute. I accept the wisdom of that. On the other hand, do the Government not appreciate the unwisdom of their reaction to this proposal that trade union leaders should be consulted in these matters?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00905"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I agree with the noble and learned Lord that, if the only argument I had to deploy tonight was that this was some long-established arrangement and therefore there was no good reason to upset it, that would not be a particularly good argument. But that is not the case. What we are comparing these proposals with is a recently established arrangement in so far as the Director General of Fair Trading is concerned&#x2014;an arrangement which was widely welcomed both by your Lordships and in another place. It is the amendment which now seeks, I would say prematurely, to reject that as unsatisfactory when it has worked so well, and to propose these new alternative arrangements.<lb/>
What I was complaining about with regard to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, was not the mere tone of invective. We have become used to that so far as the noble Lord. Lord Bruce, is concerned, and I do not complain about it. What I

complain about is his personal remarks about certain members of the Government.</membercontribution></p>

I wonder whether I may ask it now and can the Minister perhaps help me? What is the Government's estimate of the size of the Oftel staff as at the moment? I may have missed it in some debate, or document or other. I should be grateful to know that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00907"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: We have it in mind that the staff would number about 50 in this particular office. I think that is the answer to the noble Lord's question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00908"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: The Minister, in his several responses on this amendment, has no doubt wisely exercised the better part of valour. He has taken the amendment at its face value and he has sought to argue against it, first, I am sorry to say, on the grounds of precedent&#x2014;and I shall come back to that in a moment&#x2014;and, secondly, on the grounds that it is difficult to say who the appropriate trade unions should be. That second objection can readily be answered. So far as the Civil Service element is concerned, it should be the trade unions representing the grades who will be employed in the Office of Telecommunications. In so far as the Government have it in mind to recruit from outside the Civil Service, possibly only on secondment but possibly on a longer-term basis, this will most likely be from the telecommunications industry in its widest sense. The appropriate unions would therefore include those unions recognised in the telecommunications industry. This need cause no serious problems to the Government at all.<lb/>
So far as precedent is concerned, the Minister made several references to the Office of Fair Trading. I had assumed that the choice of the non-ministerial department as the formula for this office was an issue which ought not properly to be debated on this amendment but should be debated when we come to debate the Question, That the clause stand part? That was where I had proposed to make my own humble interventions. Now that he has raised it, there are substantial differences from the Office of Fair Trading which ought to be recognised.<lb/>
First, the Office of Fair Trading&#x2014;as far as I know&#x2014;except for the appointment of a director general, does not recruit from outside the Civil Service. The members of staff of OFT are all career civil servants with the exception, as he has rightly said, of Sir Gordon Borrie and his predecessor, Sir John Methven.<lb/>
Secondly, the Office of Fair Trading operates not merely on a telecommunications code, as is proposed in the Bill, and on certain other relatively limited though broad legislative criteria, but it operates on very detailed regulations laid down by departments. For example, the Consumer Credit Act is, in fact, implemented by means of enormously lengthy and complex regulatory controls and the Office of Fair Trading, therefore, does not have the kind of independence which I understand it to be the wish of the Government that the telecommunications office should have. The situation is not really parallel. I
<col>252</col>
should have thought that it was undesirable for the Minister, in approving this alternative to quangos such as the Civil Aviation Authority, or to a Government department, to cite in aid the Office of Fair Trading.<lb/>
The one aspect of the amendment in which the Minister has gone beyond the strict wording has been the issue raised by several of my noble friends about the Treasury. I find his arguments curious, not in themselves about the clause, but in relation to the other provisions of the Bill. The noble Lord mentioned to us the controls of the Treasury&#x2014;which I do not particularly object to, for I think it proper for Government centrally to keep control over numbers and over money; that is what any Government have to do. In these matters it requires at least the formal approval, I think he said, of Treasury Ministers. Therefore he is saying that there is to be political control over the basic issues of the size and cost of the Office of Telecommunications&#x2014;and so be it.<lb/>
However, why is it that in every respect other than the staffing the Government have allowed the Office of Telecommunications to escape from Government control? Why has the formula of a non-ministerial department been chosen rather than, as we have now, a perfectly satisfactory regulatory body for telecommunications with responsible offices within the Department of Industry? It can only be because on everything else the Government want to avoid the political control which it appears from their reaction to this amendment they want to impose on the staffing of the Office of Telecommunications. I suggest that the argument being put forward is in complete contrast to the argument which was put forward elsewhere in the Bill and in complete contrast to the arguments which I fear will be put up against further amendments which my friends and I have put down and which attempt to secure what the Notes on Clauses contemptuously call "political influence" but which I call "proper parliamentary responsibility".<lb/>
That was an issue upon which it was unwise of the Minister to venture in his response to these amendments. I think on subsequent clauses he will regret what he has said. As it is, the amendment may not be of fundamental importance in itself, but it is true that industrial relations in the telecommunications industry as a whole are of wider import than they are in an office of 50 people, though, having controlled for many years a company rather smaller than 50 people, I am very well aware of the need, even among 20 people, for consultation with my own staff on all these matters. The amendment starts to raise issues of principle which we on this side cannot let go and cannot ignore, even when they raise a tiny threatening head, and I shall ask your Lordships to express your opinion on this matter.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00911">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00912">[<i>Amendments Nos. 7 to 10 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00913">9.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00914"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member> moved Amendment No. 11:
<quote>Page 2, line 26, at end insert ("but the annual sum so payable shall not exceed &#x00A3;1 million without approval of both Houses of Parliament.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00915">The noble Lord said: This amendment seeks to make an addition to Clause 1(6), which reads:
<quote>"There shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament the remuneration of, and any travelling or other allowances payable under this Act to, the Director and any staff of the Director, any sums payable under this Act to or in respect of the Director and any expenses duly incurred by the Director or by any of his staff in consequence of the provisions of this Act".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00916">To these words this amendment would add:
<quote>"but the annual sum so payable shall not exceed &#x00A3;1 million without approval of both Houses of Parliament".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00917">I commend this amendment to the Committee. What we are talking about here is the expenditure of taxpayers' money. Your Lordships may feel that the allowance of &#x00A3;1 million, which, on the assumption that the staff is 50, works out at an annual average of &#x00A3;20,000 per member&#x2014;and we should bear in mind, too, that there is going to be some differential because the director himself, I believe, is going to receive &#x00A3;35,000&#x2014;ought to be adequate for this purpose. I cannot see any reason why, if it is necessary to go over this quite reasonable sum, Parliament should not be consulted. After all, Parliament is the ultimate custodian of the taxpayers' money.</p>
<col>254</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00918">I shall try to put this as pleasingly as I can. The noble Lord reproached me, when we were dealing with the last amendment, on the quality of my personal vituperation. May I say to the noble Lord, in partial reply to that, that I have listened to and read some of the personal vituperation that has emanated from Members of his own Government in another place. This vituperation has grown over the Government's four years in office progressively as the arrogance has grown. So the noble Lord must not complain if, every now and again, the party opposite, his party, get it back in kind. Sometimes they deserve it. I will say immediately that none of my vituperation is directed against the noble Lord, for whom I have the utmost respect&#x2014;nay, even affection&#x0021; Such invective as I am able to use is directed at places that ought to be accustomed to receiving it and which will be receiving it in even greater measure at a later stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00919"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: Is it not out of order to cross-connect between the two places in debate in the way that the noble Lord is suggesting? I would suggest to him that he keeps his thoughts to this Chamber and to people in this place, and does not worry too much about what happens elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00920"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has a point there. I quite agree that it is advisable from time to time to pay attention to the monkey and to ignore the organ-grinder; but every now and again one has to refer in context to the real organ-grinders behind the whole business. It does no real violence to our procedure.<lb/>
Now, having put myself right, I trust, with the noble Lord, may I say that the main purpose of this amendment is to limit expenditure and then to seek parliamentary approval. But the noble Lord must be asking himself why. I am bound to confess to him that I had in mind the first year only in regard to this amendment, and not the subsequent expenditure. Your Lordships will recall that a person has to be appointed as director general. We know what a terrible trouble it was to obtain a person to lead British Steel and then again to lead the National Coal Board. I am sorry to have to allude to the other place for just a moment but, if the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, will bear with me, he will recall the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Mr. Ian MacGregor where, according to the then Secretary of State, they had to scour the country&#x2014;ignoring the fact that Mr. MacGregor was already on the board of BL&#x2014;before they were able to find somebody. But they were not able to find anybody from domestic resources. So what did they have to do? They had to pay a transfer fee of &#x00A3;1,500,000 million to Lazard Fr&#x00E8;res, and that has been repeated in the recent appointment to the coal industry.<lb/>
How can we be quite sure, unless the constraints that we are proposing to put into the Bill are accepted, that it is going to be possible to fill this important post of director general without paying somebody a transfer fee? If I may remind the noble Lord, there are very good precedents (to use his own term) for it. We want to prevent that. If the Secretary of State, without the intervention of the Prime Minister, is to appoint his
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0136"/>
<col>255</col>
own director, we do not think we ought to give him such financial latitude when he is called to see the Prime Minister, who has already made up her mind whom she wants to fill the post and is prepared to pay a transfer fee for it. We just do not want that to happen. We all know perfectly well that no noble Lord or noble Baroness in this Chamber in his or her secret heart really approved of this MacGregor transfer fee. They had to take it because they all had to dance to the Prime Minister's tune&#x2014;"the only man in the Cabinet". We know this. We just want to prevent it. We think this is a very prudent way of seeing that no transfer fees and no extraordinary sums are paid in head hunting.<lb/>
As a matter of ordinary commercial prudence, whatever legal arguments about precedent might fall from the lips of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway&#x2014;who is notoriously reliable on these occasions&#x2014;I would have thought this amendment would commend itself to your Lordships and I sincerely hope that the Government will accept it. Otherwise they will be saying that they think the expenditure will exceed &#x00A3;1 million per annum. I do not think they want that to happen and I am quite sure they would be amenable to the adoption of the ordinary Parliamentary controls, limiting it to what the taxpayer might feel was a reasonable annual sum. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00921">9.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00922"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: May I oppose this amendment. I have listened with very great care but I do not understand the reasoning. Surely, if the approval of the Treasury is requisite, as it is, then whatever party may be in Government that is a fair and sufficient safeguard. This approval, as I read the Bill&#x2014;I shall be corrected if I am wrong&#x2014;relates to the appointment of staff and must inferentially relate to the approval of the salaries. I should hate to disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, so I shall ask: why should this be so? Is there any precedent for a provision of this type to which anyone can point? If not, when one already has the belt, why do we have to have the statutory braces?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00923"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: For the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, even by way of analogy, to refer to the other place as the "real organ-grinder" and to refer to the Upper House of Parliament as "the monkey" is not only clumsy and extremely unattractive but also deeply offensive. I would ask him to withdraw the terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00924"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: I wonder whether I can add one further reason to that put forward by my noble friend in reply to the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway. This is a new body. I know we have other regulatory bodies but this is a regulatory body of a type we have not already had, with its dimensions and extensions. It is a non-ministerial body, not directly accountable to Parliament. This will be an opportunity for accountability&#x2014;an opportunity for Parliamentary "quizzing"&#x2014;because if the &#x00A3;1 million were exceeded and they had to come to both Houses of Parliament for affirmative approval, that would give an opportunity for both Houses to question
<col>256</col>
what is being done and what is the nature of the activities carried on. It may be the only opportunity that Members of your Lordships' House would have to question this important regulatory body. Therefore, for that reason alone I believe that the Government ought to accept the amendment and endeavour to introduce some accountability for the actions of what will be an important regulatory body.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00925"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: Before the Minister rises, I have a simple question which he might like to take on board at the same time as he gives his other replies. It has to do with the difference between financial control by the Treasury and control by affirmative approval of both Houses of Parliament. My question is this. Is a non-ministerial department of the kind proposed, like the Office of Fair Trading, within the orbit of any of the Select Comittees of the other place? Is there any other opportunity than that proposed in this amendment for something more than financial control, and for some real questioning by either House of Parliament of the activities of the office?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00926"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: This amendment clearly seeks to limit the size of Oftel through direct parliamentary control of its budget. May I first repeat the assurance that I gave to your Lordships at Second Reading? I made it clear then that the regulation would be operated with a light rein and that there would be a minimum of interference with the legitimate commercial decisions, so that companies can flourish in response to this matter as long as they compete fairly with each other. Secondly, the budget of the director and his office will already be voted by Parliament. The normal parliamentary scrutiny&#x2014;the procedure is, I am sure, well familiar to the noble Lord, Lord Bruce&#x2014;is surely appropriate. No more is done before money is voted to the Office of Fair Trading, and I see no special reason for extra parliamentary control in the case of Oftel.<lb/>
May I also refer to the significance of the sum of &#x00A3;1 million? This is the estimate, given in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum accompanying the Bill, of the cost of issuing, monitoring and amending licences. It would seem that the proposers of this amendment would not wish the director to carry out his functions, except those under Part II of the Bill, without parliamentary approval. But Part III of the Bill, which we shall discuss in due course, contains some important functions; for example, the giving of advice, the investigation of consumer complaints, the establishment of advisory bodies for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the exercise of certain functions under the fair trading and competition Acts. Is it the wish of the proposers of this amendment that there should be specific parliamentary approval before the director can carry out these functions? I would hope not, but that is certainly the effect of the amendment. I think, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessarily restrictive and bureaucratic, and I hope that your Lordships will reject it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00927"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Is the Minister quite right in saying that the functions under Clauses 50 and 51 are
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0137"/>
<col>257</col>
included in that sum? The amendment of my noble friend relates purely and simply to the remuneration of the director general and his staff. The noble Lord said that part of the functions is the provision of advisory councils for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Are these to be appointed without consultation? Is he to use the same argument in relation to remuneration, <i>et cetera</i>&#x2014;which had some force&#x2014;as about not consulting trade unions? I felt at one time like asking about the advisory councils, but then I thought I would be quite out of order because they have nothing to do with the argument on this clause. Yet in opposing this amendment we have the Minister praying in aid the cost of these things. With due respect, I think that he is quite out of order in doing that. It is not included in this sum of &#x00A3;1 million.<lb/>
I was concerned about the fact that the Explanatory and Financial memorandum states:
<quote>"It is estimated that the costs of the Director and his staff in discharging his functions, the additional costs of an increase in the number of members of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and also any additional expenditure incurred by the Secretary of State in exercising his licensing functions"&#x2014;</quote>
the latter two have nothing to do with this amendment&#x2014;
<quote>"will be about &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million a year".</quote>
So I estimate that the costs of the staff and the director general will be well under &#x00A3;1 million. When we look at the functions of the director general in Clause 2, we are worried about whether there is going to be a pretty bureaucratic set-up. We are not told anything about staff selection, their quality and so on. Parliament should be given an indication. Incidentally, I am not sure whether something so financially concentrated as this is a matter for your Lordships' House. The other place might have something to say about this House taking powers in relation to finance which should not be ours. But Parliament should be able to watch how this develops and, if necessary, should be able to stop it. It is all very well for the noble Lord the Minister to say that the cost will be printed in the Estimates. The House of Lords will never have a chance to debate the Estimates. And because of the way that they are dealt with in the other place, it may be that this particular item will not properly be dealt with there, either.<lb/>
Because this matter is so important, it is essential that Parliament should have the right to draw attention to costs which soar well beyond what Parliament was led to believe they would be in respect of the development of this new organisation. I do not wish to touch upon the MacGregor theme, but I am sure that many noble Lords on the other side of this House and on the other side in the other place must be horrified at the cost of this superman. It may be that in his spare time he will do the job of director general of this body. If he is to get only &#x00A3;35,000 a year, it will only take him half an hour. It should be well within his range of abilities. Seriously, however, I believe that the Government ought to have another look at this matter if they wish to create something that is manageable and will not get out of control financially. We should be able to get on to it if this body is required to come back to Parliament, should it need more than the &#x00A3;1 million to be allocated to it.</membercontribution></p>
<col>258</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00928">9.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00929"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Whatever the intention of the amendment may be, the fact is that the functions which I described in my earlier remarks will have to be paid for out of the sums of money we are here discussing and which are provided for in this clause. The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, is right to sound a cautionary note about how far it is proper for Members of your Lordships' House to consider these matters. The other place would take grave exception to any proposal that your Lordships' House should have specific control over the sum of money which is to be made available, or otherwise, for these purposes.<lb/>
I believe that the fears which have been expressed about the creation of some monster which is out of control are exaggerated. First, there are the procedures involved in the approval of the Estimates, to which I have referred. The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, indicated that his experience is that these matters do not always receive the scrutiny they deserve in the other place. Doubtless that is the case. I have not had the privilege of being a Member of the other place so I cannot say whether or not that is so. Your Lordships will also be aware that the director is obliged to prepare an annual report for Parliament. This will give considerable scope for parliamentary scrutiny of the affairs of Oftel and the director general. The combination of those two procedures&#x2014;the scrutiny of the Estimates, however effective that may be, and the submission of an annual report to Parliament&#x2014;will, I believe, provide proper Parliamentary control over these matters. I hope the Committee will be content to leave it there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00930"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: I can understand the noble Lord's position tonight. He has to resist the amendment. But could not the noble Lord at least say that there are to be further stages of the Bill? There are Members on all sides of the Committee who are anxious about this subsection if there is to be no amendment. Therefore, if the Government cannot accept the amendment now, can they say that they will be prepared to look at some of the serious arguments which have been advanced in support of this amendment and will then come back with some <i>modus operandi?</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00931"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to have to tell the Committee that I have not been persuaded by the arguments which have been deployed in support of this amendment. If I were to give some assurance that we will look at the matter, I fear that I should be misleading your Lordships. I am convinced that the proposals contained in this Bill are the right course to follow.<lb/>
I have said before that these arrangements have some precedent&#x2014;as indeed they do&#x2014;in terms of the Director General of Fair Trading. Your Lordships have not found that argument particularly convincing, but it is the case that we are looking at an established procedure&#x2014;not an historical, long-established procedure which may be creaking with the passage of years, but a recently-created procedure which has worked very well indeed, in my estimation. It is one that, at the time of its inception, enjoyed the support both of your Lordships and of another place. I hope that the Committee will be content to leave it there.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0138"/>
<col>259</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00932"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>; Can the noble Lord the Minister clear up the point raised by my noble friend Lord Ross of Marnock? As and when the advisory bodies come to be set up, presumably they will be staffed by professionals. I wonder whether they are included in the estimate of 50 Oftel staff, or will they be additional? That seems to me to be relevant to the matter we are now discussing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00933"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My understanding is that the advisory staff will be additional to the number I gave to your Lordships earlier. If I am wrong about that, I will write to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00934"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I am obliged to the noble Lord the Minister. It is quite clear from the financial explanations on page viii of the Bill that the sum of f &#x00A3;1 million suggested by this amendment is quite a reasonable sum anyway. If one says that the total cost, which includes the additional staff, of the Monopolies Commission will be about &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; million; if there are going to be savings, as my noble friend Lord Ross of Marnock pointed out, of &#x00A3;100,000 in connection with the Post Office Users' National Council; if there is to be further revenue; and if the total cost is put at &#x00A3;500,000, I should have thought that the &#x00A3;1 million suggested was a reasonable sum.<lb/>
I am mindful of what was said by the noble Lord as to the desirability of this House intervening in financial matters. I noted too the observations of my noble friend Lord Ross of Marnock on that point. I should not have thought that they were applicable in this particular case. The House is not entitled to intervene in Finance Bills or anything of that kind, but we frequently discuss various expenditure on one thing or another to be made by the Government in connection with Bills, so far without any particular disapproval on the part of another place.<lb/>
May I say to the noble Lord, Lord Morris, whose sensitivities I appear to have upset, that the words I used were of an allegorical nature and were certainly not intended to give any personal offence? If I may say so, I find the noble Lord, Lord Morris, to be a most agreeable person with whom to debate matters and I should not wish to cross him in any way.<lb/>
Although I should prefer the limitation that I have mentioned to be in the Bill, and indeed we on this side of the House support this amendment, I am persuaded by the reasonableness of the noble Lord the Minister in this matter. I am sure he will use his best endeavours to ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted on excessive transfer fees.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00938">On Question, Whether Clause 1 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00939"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry to have to return the Committee to the whole purposes of Part I
<col>260</col>
of this Bill, which sets up the appointment of a director general and a completely new tier to the new team of administration and supervision within the industry itself. We cannot let this occasion pass without indicating very firmly that of course this Part of the Bill is a complete irrelevance to the needs of the telecommunications industry in this country; it serves no useful purpose whatever. No complaint has been made concerning the conduct of British Telecom and its undoubted success over the past decade and even before. The country knows perfectly well, in spite of inspired press propaganda in some sections of the press to the contrary, that the story of British Telecom is a success on every count.<lb/>
Really, the sole purpose of the Bill, which necessitated this regulatory machinery, is the determination of the Government to privatise this highly successful industry. I am sorry the noble Lord finds that boring, but I am afraid that it has got to be said and it is going to be said again. It is only when one comes into the later parts of the Bill that one finds the terrific amount of machinery that has to be established in order to preserve the public interest. As British Telecom has been working over the years&#x2014;and I have made reference to the accounts and have offered to be cross-examined upon them&#x2014;it is quite clear that British Telecom has served a national purpose, has operated profitably and has been able to finance itself for the past 6 years out of its own resources with an average of 6.8 per cent. return on capital employed in the business. It has been responsible for a very great deal of the technical innovation that has taken place in the telecommunications field. Employed in British Telecom are some of the finest telecommunication and electronic engineers in the country, and scientists as well. It is, therefore, a story of success.<lb/>
All the items that are put in by way of public regulatory machinery, of which Clause 1 of the Bill is the leading part, are completely unnecessary unless British Telecom passes out of public control&#x2014;I repeat, completely unnecessary. Under the telecommunications Acts and the wireless telegraphy Acts and the various licensing provisions, the appropriate Minister has always been able, should he so desire, merely by the issue of directions to the chief of British Telecom, to ensure that the public interest is preserved. Those who have led British Telecom over the years have been fully conscious of that: they have been conscious of their public duty; they have known what is required of them. And, where they have been uncertain as to what has been required of them, they have always been able to consult with the appropriate Secretary of State to find out what he thinks about their plans.<lb/>
So British Telecom has been able to function over the years without this kind of regulatory machinery. Indeed, the Government found out in another place&#x2014;I am sorry to mention another place again&#x2014;that this machinery did not meet the requirements of their own supporters, let alone those of the Opposition. As a result, we had at a very late stage the introduction of specific duties under Clause 3. But none of this would have been necessary had it not been for the Government's determination to see that 51 per cent. of the industry was privatised. It was then hurriedly realised&#x2014;as indeed is very succinctly set out
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0139"/>
<col>261</col>
in the <i>Economist</i> for 23rd April last&#x2014;that they had created a private giant over which, unless they did something, they could exercise no control at all in the public interest. That is why of course all this regulatory machinery becomes necessary.<lb/>
Even so, I have no doubt that further misgivings will be expressed. The noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, is not in his place, but I can imagine what he possibly thought when he read <i>The Times</i> for 30th April, where it was revealed that British Telecom are to sell computers, or what he might have thought when he read the <i>Financial Times</i> of the same date, where it was indicated that British Telecom was going to move into office automation. I suspect that perhaps in a later stage of the Bill he will express misgivings as to how all this will react on the British electronic manufacturing industry.<lb/>
British Telecom was conscious of its public responsibility. Under the general supervision of the Secretary of State, it has always been the policy of British Telecom to give preference to British manufacturers. It did not have to be told what its public duty was at all. But fired with the magnificent vision of the industry being privatised, can it be wondered that the chief of British Telecom (who presumably will carry on his functions as before under the control of the director general or the Secretary of State) has already given notice that he intends to buy cheaply wherever he can? This, after all, is in the best traditions of competitive industry as defined by the Prime Minister in another place. So the whole of this machinery which has been put in is an expression of the Government's fundamental distrust of the way in which this gigantic private corporation will function if it is left to its own devices to function within the normal canons of free enterprise.<lb/>
Nowhere is the barrenness of the thinking behind this Bill more revealed than it is by the establishment of Oftel. It is argued that unfettered competition yields the best results in the best possible of worlds and ensures the prosperity of everybody, and why is not free enterprise completely unfettered to do exactly as it wishes. This Government in this Bill already destroy this basic philosophical argument. They acknowledge that there has to be control. This whole elaborate apparatus of control is being introduced solely so that there can be some plausible justification seen by the British public, British manufacturers, the staff and the world at large for this truly pathetic effort to privatise on a scale which the London Stock Exchange will find difficult to deal with, in any event. It will absorb the total capital resources available for investment, so <i>The Times</i> informs us, over a couple of years. The Government will have to think again.<lb/>
I should like to eliminate this clause altogether as that strikes to the root of the Bill. The Government would describe a vote on the Question that the clause shall stand part of the Bill as an effort to wreck it. With what I hope is engaging candour I shall say that that is precisely the purpose of voting against the Question that the clause stand part. With those amiable sentiments, I express the hope that the Government will accept in good faith, and that the noble Lord, Lord
<col>262</col>
Morris, will approve, the intimation that we may have to troop into the Division Lobby against them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00940"><member>Viscount Thurso</member><membercontribution>: On behalf of my noble friends on the Liberal Benches, and in particular my noble friend Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, I feel that at this point I should say that we were very sad to have lost the amendment which would have set up a council to advise and help the Director General of Telecommunications, or whatever he is to be called. We are especially sad that, because of its wording, Amendment No. 12 was lost in the general collapse of that particular effort on our behalf to set up a council.<lb/>
We feel that the principles enshrined in Amendment No. 12 are worthy of consideration and probably debate, and at a later stage we may well feel it necessary to bring forward another amendment which is properly worded. It could perhaps be put to your Lordships' House at Report stage. However, I consider that now, when we are discussing the Question of clause stand part, it is right to mention this particular point; otherwise it might be thought that we simply let the principle enshrined in Amendment No. 12 go by default. We do not let it go by default, and we may well return to it later.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00941"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: It is quite clear from what the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, has said, that he has totally and completely missed the whole point and purpose of the Bill. In these days of dynamic change in this industry, which will affect the way of life of every single person in the country, it is quite wrong that the tempo of change resides in the hands of one, two, or even six, corporations. It is essential that the tempo of change resides with Government, and that is the fundamental reason for Clause 1.<lb/>
I do not think that the noble Viscount, Lord Thurso, should be distressed about Amendment No. 12, because Clause 3(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill provides that one of the duties of the director general shall be,
<quote>"to maintain and promote effective competition between United Kingdom operators".</quote>
That certainly covers part of the point which is in line with Amendment No. 12. I would certainly suggest to Members of your Lordships' Committee that you support the clause in its entirety.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00942"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: If I may say so, the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, admirable though it was, had a familiar ring about it. Rather than reply at length, may I refer your Lordships to what I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, since the noble Lord repeated much of what he had said on Second Reading. My reply is in col. 403 of <i>Hansard</i> of 18th April. If your Lordships want even further enlightenment, I would refer you to the speech of my noble friend Lord Glenarthur, which begins at col. 461.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00944"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I should like to make a very simple point, for I am a very simple person. We are dealing here with the Director General of Telecommunications. We have spoken about his remuneration. We have spoken about his staff, and the cost of providing them. Where is he going to meet the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0140"/>
<col>263</col>
staff? Are they going to meet somewhere on the Embankment? There is no evidence that they are to have any office of their own. Is the remaining nationalised part of the telecommunications industry going to have to put them up? If they have to get themselves an office in London, it will cost them some money, and it may well be that the Financial Memorandum which we spoke about earlier underestimates just what the cost of this body is going to be.<lb/>
I agree with everything that my noble friend said about the daft dogma of this whole thing. Not a single soul in your Lordships' House or in the other place, on either side, ever thought that we would get to the point where a Tory Government which proclaimed their pride in what was being done in these services and in what was done in the old services of the Post Office for so long would descend to this kind of thing.<lb/>
I am proud of what was done. For a long time after the war, when I became a Member of Parliament, I served on the Post Officer Users' Council, which in those days also dealt with the telegraph side. The work that was done by the engineers, and the co-operation that existed between them and British manufacturers, was all to the good of this country. It built up a tremendous reputation, which has continued under British Telecom. It is a sad day when the Government ask us to be proud of the virtual destruction and breaking up of an organisation in which there was a pride and prestige that was a credit to Britain. It is not a happy day for Britain that they should do something like this purely for dogma&#x2014;and daft dogma, at that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00945"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I am happy to be able to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, that the director general will not have to meet on the Embankment, and that offices will be provided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00946"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: By whom? Who will pay for them? Is that sum contained within the Financial Memorandum?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00947"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: It is the provision made in Clause 1(6).</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00948"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: We are discussing, on clause stand part, the regulatory machinery and the director general. We are not discussing the tempo of change, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Morris. We shall come to that when we deal with Clause 2. There will undoubtedly be much to be said about it.<lb/>
I understand that the Department of Industry has a section of 40 or more staff which, with British Telecom, handles the affairs of telecommunications satisfactorily and with the expertise to which my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington referred. Why can it not be left there? We have often had to question powers being left with the Secretary of State. But here we have a department with a section that functions efficiently. Surely, with that staff and all the expertise, the knowledge and the know-how that exists in British Telecom, which cannot be denied, why cannot the regulatory machinery, if it has to exist, be left with the Department of Industry and the section to which I have referred?<lb/>
<col>264</col>
I think that on a previous amendment, if I heard correctly, the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, said that this matter will be exercised with a light rein. My noble friend, in speaking on clause stand part, referred to the reasons why we are faced with this regulatory machinery. Paragraph 2 of the Department of Industry's own paper on the functions of the Office of Telecommunications, issued in November 1982, stated:
<quote>"The Government wishes to be able to ensure that after BT is transferred to the private sector those who own, manage and work in BT PLC do not use its market dominance to make excessive profits, operate inefficiently or prevent or restrict the development of competition in telecommunications".</quote>
The very fact of giving market dominance to stop people making excessive profits and operating inefficiently means that we have to set up this regulatory machinery. The noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, says, "Nonsense". I am quoting&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00949"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: Of course we have to do so, because the market is not proper. The trouble is that British Telecom has 97 per cent. of it thanks to the years of nationalisation previously suffered. Until the market is made proper, one is bound to have some kind of regulatory machinery. I personally hope that in due course British Telecom will find itself breaking up into bits so that it does not continue to dominate the market. I think that that is very dangerous and I entirely agree that it is very dangerous right now, before the Bill ever becomes an Act. It is a great pity that we have these huge organisations which have come out of the dogma of noble Lords opposite and which dominate markets which they should not dominate. We can have proper competition if we have organisations of a reasonable size and we have to have some type of regulatory machinery because that is not yet the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00950"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone. He has given us some further information as regards the facts when we come to deal with Clause 2, which is what we are really talking about. There is another side of the argument that will have to be heard. Nobody challenges&#x2014;and I am not going to do so as regards Clause 2&#x2014;the success, competence and efficiency of BT and its research and development capabilities. I have quoted the reason why the Government say that we have got to have regulatory machinery: with the change to the private sector, the company has to be stopped from making excessive profits or operating inefficiently. If you had never interfered and brought forward Clause 2 you would not need to have this, and that point will be made when we come to Clause 2.<lb/>
The Government have often said that they want to avoid bureaucracy in industry. If there was ever a piece of bureaucracy that has been set up, it is this regulatory machinery. However, time is getting on and I shall therefore leave out many of the points which I had intended to raise. It must be borne in mind, as was said during a previous debate, that this regulatory machinery is taking over the work of POUNC, but there will be no consumer representative putting the case for the consumers as there is under the present machinery.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0141"/>
<col>265</col>
My noble friend Lord Ross referred to the advisory committees to be set up under Clause 50. There has only been reference from this side of the Committee to Clause 50 and the fact that there is power for the director general to set up advisory committees. But do we know how they will be formed? The advisory committees will be composed of members whom the director general himself will appoint. Yet these are supposed to be the only advisory committees which will provide regulatory machinery. If noble Lords challenge this, they can read Clause 50, because I read it before I made my notes a few minutes ago.<lb/>
This is a bureaucratic device. It is unnecessary. I recognise that, if we are going to have privatisation, we shall need regulatory machinery, but it surely could be left with the body which now exists inside the Department of Industry and with the Secretary of State so that it could be made directly accountable. Surely no one will regard reference to an annual report as sufficient accountability and control over this vast industry with an expenditure of &#x00A3;2 billion a year. That is why we oppose Clause 1.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00951"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: I wonder very briefly whether my noble friend the Minister will look into this question because it seems that neither Clause 1(6) nor Clause 50(5) are apt to provide the appropriate answer to the noble Lord&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00953"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: With respect, I doubt it very much. If we read the clause, we find that they are related to remuneration, travelling or other allowances, and then:

I have heard my noble friend Lord Mottistone say, "No", three times from a sedentary position. All I am saying to my noble friend the Minister is that this really does need looking at.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00954"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I could explain at some length how the matter works. Perhaps your Lordships will forgive me if I do not do so, but I will happily write to my noble friend with an explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00955"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord include me in that explanation? Before we leave this matter, may I have a promise that I, too, shall be included in the explanation?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00957">Clause 1 agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00958">Schedule 1 [<i>Director General of Telecommunications</i>]:</p>
<col>266</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00959">9.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00960"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member> moved Amendment No. 13:
<quote>Page 76, line 6, at end insert ("subject to approval by a resolution of each House of Parliament".).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00961">The noble Lord said: I draw attention to Schedule 1 of the Bill. It deals generally with the matters relating to the Director General of Telecommunications and, indeed, was referred to specifically in Clause 1 of the Bill. Paragraph 1 of the schedule says:
<quote>"There shall be paid to the Director such remuneration, and such travelling and other allowances, as the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury may determine."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00962">The amendment to which we seek to obtain the approval of the Committee is to add the words:
<quote>"subject to approval by a resolution of each House of Parliament".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00963">On the face of it, it would not appear that this is a matter of very great importance, although this is a new office, and of course Parliament has a legitimate interest in determining the director's remuneration, travelling and other allowances. There would seem to be no reason why it should not be subject to the parliamentary safeguards that this amendment suggests.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00964">On an earlier occasion I had the opportunity to advert to Section 29 of the Companies Act, where, as noble Lords will recall, the mere alteration of a category to be included in an appendix was made subject to the affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. It was a very trivial matter, but for some reason the Government thought it necessary that such a revolutionary change&#x2014;which I believe involved pharmacists or people of that kind&#x2014;merited the attention of the whole House. Judging relatively, I should have thought that this is a matter upon which Parliament ought to be consulted, particularly in the earlier stages. I commend it to the Committee. It seems to me to be eminently reasonable, and I look forward to the noble Lord agreeing with the amendment. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00965"><member>Earl De La Warr</member><membercontribution>: It seems to me rather surprising that the noble Lord should bring forward these two amendments, because he gave way on an amendment which, so far as I can see, dealt with nearly the same principle. Having said that, it appears to me to be quite ridiculous that Parliament should have to deal with the salary of one man. I cannot think of anything more calculated to waste Parliament's time than just to pick one man almost out of a hat just because it is a new job.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00966"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I was about to say exactly the same as my noble friend. The amendments, indeed, seek to fix the salary and pension entitlements of the director, who will be a civil servant, by an affirmative resolution of both Houses. Why pick on the poor director? There are over 600,000 other civil servants whose salaries, wages or pensions could be fixed in the same way. However, I take it that the intention is to reduce the director's salary and so reduce the attraction of the post to able and well-qualified candidates.<lb/>
However, I do not see why Parliament should wish to become involved in such a matter. The director will be a senior official ranking, as I have said, with the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0142"/>
<col>267</col>
Director General of Fair Trading, and will be paid accordingly. There are already arrangements for setting the salaries of senior officials, and we do not intend to breach such arrangements for the director. The Director General of Fair Trading's salary is not fixed by Parliament.<lb/>
If the amendments are accepted, they would delay the establishment of Oftel, and cause extra work for Parliament, which in my view is wholly unnecessary. I should point out that the Bill already provides for scrutiny of any financial arrangements by the Treasury, which acts as an effective guardian in such matters. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will promptly withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00967"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry that the noble Lord should take that attitude about it. I hasten to reassure him that our interests would not be purely negative. We might even decide that the salary offered was inadequate. There is no intention to apply the pruning knife to these matters; merely to bring it to public review. The noble Earl, Lord De La Warr, indicated that the appointment of one man and the salary was of insufficient significance to attract the interest of Parliament. May I recall to his memory the almost uproar in another place when the appointment of Mr. MacGregor was originally announced. That was of sufficient parliamentary interest and aroused a great deal of criticism from his own party in the other place. There is very often interest in the appointment of an individual.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00968"><member>Earl De La Warr</member><membercontribution>: Will the noble Lord give way? Were there not other circumstances attached to his salary which naturally provoked a slightly greater interest?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00969"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: I quite agree, but there is no undertaking from the Government&#x2014;I have not heard one this evening, although I would be pleased to receive it&#x2014;that we shall not once again in this case he faced with a transfer fee. There is no undertaking to the contrary from the Government. For all I know, there may be some unsuspecting soul in the world&#x2014;probably in America&#x2014;to whom an inducement in terms of a transfer fee may be offered in order to fulfil the onerous burdens of this office. I do not want to press the point, particularly at this late hour. Possibly the best thing for me to do in these circumstances would be to ask your Lordships' leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00973">On Question whether Schedule 1 shall be agreed to?</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00974"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I was hoping that my noble friend would move his next amendment. I am fascinated by paragraph 2 of this schedule. Those who have heard me on the subject before will not be surprised that I have raised this because I have raised it on recent Scottish measures. I am appalled by the fact that not only have we got to pay this new director general a very
<col>268</col>
substantial salary, but we have to pay him, or there is the possibility that he will be paid, as may be determined by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury&#x2014;the whole band is there&#x2014;
<quote>"such a pension, allowance or gratuity, as may be so determined",</quote>
in respect of his retirement or death.<lb/>
This gentleman is appointed for five years. I have not the slightest doubt that he is already well endowed with pensions from his other work, and here we have to give him another pension for five years' service. When I think of what happened in another place, which eventually got round in, I think, 1965 to even thinking about pensions after service which had lasted 33, 34, 35 years in some cases, it astonishes me that this MacGregor theme goes on. I hope my noble friend realises when he is calculating the cost to this country of Mr. MacGregor that we have not seen it all yet. There may well be a pension. There may be a gratuity, an allowance when he actually gives up the job. Judging by the way he has been able to negotiate in the past, I have not the slightest doubt that he will be able to negotiate a very handsome pension or gratuity in respect of his eventual retirement from his present positions.<lb/>
I want to know what is the justification for this. It was not always so. I welcome the fact that there is one new phrase in this clause. The recent case we dealt with was, I think, in respect of the chairman of the Mental Welfare Commission in Scotland, who was given the possible advantages of these things as well. But the new phrase&#x2014;and I want to know if it is new&#x2014;is:
<quote>"payments towards provision for such a pension, allowance or gratuity, as may be so determined".</quote>
Is that new? If it is not, may I be referred to the other statutes in which it appears?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00975"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I can answer that question swiftly. It is taken straight from the statute which, as I have said on so many occasions this evening, set up the Director-General of Fair Trading in his office.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-00988">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00989">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have received a copy of the case against privatisation from the Society of Telecom Executives, and what comments they have made in reply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00990"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government received a copy of the Society of Telecom Executives' publication, <i>The Case against Privatisation of British Telecom,</i> on 26th April. A reply will be sent shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00991"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the Government have discussed the report with the members of the Society of Telecom Executives. The noble Lord will know that this is an authoritative report which soberly sets out the case against privatisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00992"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said, the document has only just been received, and it has not yet been possible for me to reach a considered conclusion on it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Psychiatric Secure Units: Places</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00993">11.7 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00994"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00995">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00996">To ask Her Majesty's Government how many places are now available in permanent psychiatric secure units.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00997"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one permanent regional secure unit, providing 30 beds, of which 20 are currently in use, opened in November 1980 at St. Luke's Hospital, Middlesbrough. In addition, facilities at the Towers Hospital, Leicester; Langdon Hospital, Devon; Rainhill Hospital, Mersey; and Prestwich Hospital, Manchester, offering among them 160 beds, should begin to admit patients shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<col>272</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00998"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Lord the Minister for the information which I requested, disappointing though it is coming nine years after the Butler Committee submitted an urgent interim report recommending these units. I should also like to thank the noble Lord for the information he gave for which I had not asked, which looks distinctly more impressive. May I ask him two supplementary questions&#x2014;and I know that he has been giving a great deal of thought to these matters. First, are the Government still committed to an overall programme of 1,000 places in the first instance; and, if so, when does he think the programme will be achieved? Secondly, do his plans envisage that when the units are available on a more substantial scale some worthwhile relief will be given to the special hospitals and to prisons?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-00999"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the noble Lord's first supplementary question is: Yes, we are still committed in principle to achieving 1,000 places in regional secure units, and I hope that by the end of 1985 about 600 places will be available in such units. As the noble Lord is aware, these units are designed as a medium-secure facility between the special hospitals, on the one hand, and the psychiatric hospitals in the National Health Service, on the other. Certainly when they are fully in use they will provide some measure of relief to both.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01000"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister whether the reason why some beds at St. Luke's Hospital are not in use is because there is not an adequate number of trained staff? Before the other units open, will the Government train more staff for this specialty?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01001"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness is right when she says that the reason why some beds are not in use at St. Luke's is that there is not yet a sufficient number of staff available. This is a new venture within the National Health Service, and therefore it is not surprising that we have not yet been able to obtain all the staff which we want for the programme; but recruitment is proceeding, and so is some training.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01002"><member>Baroness Faithful</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend the Minister what has held up the opening of the regional secure unit in the Oxford region, since plans for it were being discussed nine years ago?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01003"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that staffing problems were the principal difficulty with regard to the unit to which my noble friend refers. I have it in mind to visit that particular facility shortly to see the problems for myself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01004"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that according to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, and figures which were given just the other day, at the last count on 30th March the number of mentally disordered offenders in our prison system had increased for the first time since 1977, and that this is a matter for great dismay considering that the noble Lord took pride in appearing before the all-party Parliamentary Penal Affairs Committee last year and
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0145"/>
<col>273</col>
stating that considerable reductions had been effected as a result of facilities being opened in the National Health Service? Has not the money which was earmarked for this purpose in the National Health Service been spent by regional health authorities for other purposes, and is that not one of the reasons why we are not making greater progress in reducing the numbers of mentally disordered prisoners?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01005"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: No, My Lords, the noble Lord is not quite right in that. The money which was allocated to the National Health Service specifically for this purpose has, by and large, though not exclusively, been spent on interim secure units, rather than on the permament facilities which the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, was asking about. As for the position within prisons, a great many of the mentally disordered prisoners to whom the noble Lord refers are probably not sufficiently ill for detention under the Mental Health Acts to be justified, and therefore they have to be detained in prisons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01006"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may use the expression of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, may I ask how many mentally disordered persons there are now for whom, if other things were equal, permanent psychiatric secure units ought to be available?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01007"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know the precise answer to that question because it would depend on which of the patients could be certified under the mental health legislation. Naturally, I do not have that figure in front of me, but I could try to find out and write to the noble and learned Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Cruise Missiles: Arms Control Policy</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01008">11.13 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01009"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01010">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01011">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether the deployment of the cruise missile would invalidate existing arms control agreements and render it difficult if not impossible to reach any future agreements with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01012"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no. The deployment of cruise missiles in Western Europe would invalidate no existing arms control agreement. NATO proposals at the INF talks in Geneva have been for an agreement which would eliminate this class of missile altogether. But it is NATO's determination to deploy cruise missiles if necessary which has brought the Soviet Union to negotiate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01013"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that while all this is going on, the risks of unintentional nuclear war, referred to in a United Nations report, are with us all the time? Is he aware that the deployment of cruise missiles at the end of this year would sharply increase the probability of nuclear
<col>274</col>
war in 1984? Finally, is he aware that, in these circumstances, the Prime Minister's dismissal of Mr. Andropov's latest proposal is suicidally irresponsible?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01014"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the fact of the matter is that we are in a situation now when it is up to the Russians. The allies have made clear all along that what we want to do is to remove these terrible weapons from the whole European theatre altogether. That is the zero option which remains our ultimate objective. Since then, the Americans have put forward an interim proposal to limit the number of warheads on these INF missiles. The Russians are therefore now being asked what level of these terrible weapons they would accept in Europe. We now await a reply from them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01015"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister look at cruise in relation to general defence policy? Did he see in the <i>Church Times</i> or maybe elsewhere, last week that a meeting of Church leaders from over 60 countries expressed serious views about nuclear policy, as did the clergy and the bishops of the United States? Will the noble Lord suggest to his right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence that he may be surrounded by "cannons" to the left of him, as he often suspects, and by "cannons" to the right of him, and that it is about time he reviewed his policies in the light of the views of the Church leaders? Will he also suggest to his right honourable friend that he should not do what he often does and discard almost anything that does not agree with his preconceived ideas?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01016"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord mentions the <i>Church Times.</i> The noble Lord knows better than I that the Synod voted for multilateral disarmament to try to reach security and peace for the future through that channel. That is the way. The Government are trying to secure it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01017"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Government insist on their view that British and French nuclear forces are not in practice intermediate weapons in exactly the same sense as the SS20s in Russia?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01018"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if one tries to go down that track, there are two immediate difficulties. The first is that the talks between the Russians and the Americans in the INF negotiations in Geneva have always been accepted as bilateral negotiations. That was the wish of both sides. It would mean changing the rules in the middle of the negotiations to breach that. Secondly, if those independent deterrents were brought into the negotiations, the effect would be to grant the Soviet Union, one of the two negotiators, superiority over the United States. That is not a very good start to that particular <i>d&#x00E9;marche.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01019"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend say whether the CND&#x2014;or the voice of CND in this House as represented by Lord Jenkins of Putney&#x2014;has made any representations to the Soviet Union about the deployment of its 320 SS20s? Is there any evidence that the Russians have radically cut down their S4s and S5s in addition to the SS20s deployed over the last three years?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0146"/>
<col>275</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01020"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that, if I may say so, is a good question. May I give a general answer? People often talk at the moment about a moratorium or a freeze. If that happened, we would be freezing the number of intermediate land-based nuclear missiles in Europe targeted upon each of our countries in the free world at about 4 to 1 in favour of the Soviet Union. In fact, so far as land-based missiles are concerned, none is held by the West at all. Meanwhile, as my noble friend's question brings out, the Russians have been continuing to deploy SS20s and are not applying any idea or a moratorium to the Asian regions of the USSR.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01021"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister why President Reagan and the Americans have not got the jitters, as we have, about the Russians having more missiles than we have? Is that really proven? I do not believe it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01022"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness's question brings us hack to the original Question. It is because the West is concerned about the enormous build-up both in intermediate range weapons in the East and also strategic weapons in the East that the allies have put forward proposals that there shall he no intermediate range weapons at all in Europe and that there shall be very deep cuts in the interballistic monsters that both sides hold. I repeat that it is now up to the Russians. We want to know if they will agree to no intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe. If they will not agree to that, what number will they agree to?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01023"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, unless we can trust them a bit, where are we going to get to? There is this constant mistrust with Russia. After all, there was a time when we were allies in the First World War. So it is a possibility. It must be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01024"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the concern of the noble Baroness about mistrust is, of course, well placed. All that the allies can do is to negotiate in good faith while remaining strong and vigilant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01025"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that each side believes itself to be outnumbered by the other and that each side is perfectly capable of putting up a good case, provided that it is sufficiently selective about the particular type of weapons which it is matching with those of the other side? But international comparison suggests that overall, taking into account all the weapons, there is a rough equality. As regards the question raised by the noble Lord, the Minister might well have replied that he was not in a position to answer for the CND. But the answer to the question is that I&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01026"><member>Several noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Question&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01027"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the answer to the question is that I myself have raised the question of the SS20 in the Kremlin with Mr. Yuri Zhukov and I received a very courteous and lengthy reply from Mr. Zhukov to the effect that as far as the Soviet Union is concerned&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01029"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the noble Lord want the answer to the question? Perhaps I can put it in an interrogative form. I am bringing my sentence to a close. Is the Minister aware, therefore, that in these circumstances, since the answer of the Soviet Union to this question is that all weapons should be counted, the Government must take into consideration all the weapons which are likely to fall on Soviet soil?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01030"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to all that the noble Lord has just been saying is very simple indeed. Let both sides agree that there shall be no intermediate range missiles, land-based, targeted on any of the countries in Europe&#x2014;namely, the zero option&#x2014;and then the people of both Western Europe and the East can live in peace.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Greenham Common: Blacklisting of<lb/> Contractors</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01031">11.22 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01032"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01033">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01034">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in view of the decision by the Council of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament to intensify the campaign against Tarmac Ltd., and other Government contractors at Greenham Common, they will indicate what legal and other measures they propose to take to prevent local authorities from following the example of the London borough of Southwark, in blacklisting the contractors concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01035"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, local authorities should be very careful as to their attitude to this campaign. It is quite wrong that political considerations of this kind should affect decisions on contracts. Authorities taking such a course would lay themselves open to action in the courts for acting unreasonably by taking into account irrelevant or improper considerations. The Government will keep in view the question whether the remedies available to firms that are discriminated against are adequate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01036"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. Would he not agree that what is represented in the action of Southwark and other local authorities, is an abuse of power on a truly deplorable level? First, in the debate that we had on this matter in January, the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, indicated that there was going to be a reference to the Office of Fair Trading. Has that taken place and, if so, with what result? Secondly, would the noble Lord not agree that the Government have a duty to protect their own contractors and, what is even more important, the employees of those contractors, from arbitrary action by local authorities on the lines advocated now by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament? Finally, does he not agree that there is a need to protect the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0147"/>
<col>277</col>
interests of the ratepayers in local authority areas where local councils behave in this intolerable fashion? Is it not wholly wrong that, even if a tender is the lowest, it should be rejected by a local authority simply on the ground that the councillors who form the majority party in that local authority dislike the fact that the company concerned has won a contract at Greenham Common?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01037"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that was rather a mouthful of supplementary questions. Perhaps I can best answer three of them by saying that in my view it is clearly wrong that local authorities should spend money on propaganda exercises which have nothing to do with the proper functions of local government. Local councillors should remember that they are elected to serve all the residents and ratepayers in their area, and they have a responsibility to them for the proper stewardship of ratepayers' money.<lb/>
As regards the reference to the Director General of Fair Trading, I understand that the Director General does not propose to make the Southwark resolution the subject of formal investigation. My own feeling is that action by the Monopolies and Mergers Corn mission does not seem entirely appropriate to deal with the manipulation of selective tendering arrangements by local authorities to support political attitudes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01038"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend the Minister not agree that the existing common law if invoked would be adequate to deal with this situation? Would he not agree that it is open to a blacklisted contractor to apply to the High Court for a declaration that that resolution is invalid, is an unreasonable restraint of trade and is contrary to public policy? Would he also not agree that that contractor could also claim damages against the council and its members in conspiracy to injure him in his way of business without lawful justification or excuse or even perhaps&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01039"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order&#x0021; Reading&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01040"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the greatest respect to my noble friend, I am not myself a court of law. However, I can confirm that court action could be taken by a firm affected by the decision or by a ratepayer or a councillor for the area, if that were deemed to be appropriate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01041"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could not the contractor, if he submitted the lowest tender and it was rejected for whatever reason, be it political or otherwise, complain to the district auditor and could not then the councillors who rejected that lowest tender and preferred the higher one, be surcharged with the difference?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01042"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, but that goes very much wider than the general terms of the Question on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01043"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has indicated this morning the anxieties of the Government as regards this matter. First, is he going to
<col>278</col>
draw the attention of the local authority associations to the answers that have been given today? Secondly, do the Government not recognise that they have a direct responsibility to their own contractors and those who work for them? Is it not necessary for the Government to demonstrate that they are going to protect the interests of employees of companies of this kind who are going to be treated in this wholly unreasonable fashion by local authorities as a result of pressure from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01044"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I most readily undertake to inform the associations of local authorities as to the exchanges in your Lordships' House this morning, but I must make the point that it would be quite inappropriate for the Government to legislate because of a particular case. It would be wrong also to rush into new legislation without evidence that the existing remedies failed to work.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Parochial Charities (Neighbourhood Trusts)<lb/> Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01046">11.28 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01047"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. In moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I am aware that in its present form, or perhaps in any form, it is not acceptable to Her Majesty's Government which, in effect, means the Charity Commission, whose advice the Government take. Nevertheless, I dare to think that the present unsatisfactory position in England and Wales of parochial charities for the poor should be brought to the notice of your Lordships' House. I am heartened that my noble friend the Minister may, if your Lordships agree that this Bill be read a second time, accept the recommendation that a Select Committee of the House of Lords should be set up to look into parochial charities in this country.<lb/>
This is a complicated legal and social problem and I am grateful for the help that I have received from the Oxfordshire Rural Community Council and in particular Sir Charles Kimber; from the Humberside County Council through the good offices of Mr. Frank Courtney; and from those interested in parochial charities in Wales. Indeed, I know that the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, will speak on the Welsh parochial charities. I am grateful to the West Yorkshire Charities Information Bureau, the Community Council of Humberside, and the South Yorkshire Information Service, the many individuals up and down the country who have written to me, from Cornwall to Cambridge. There are in this country 140,000 registered charities. Of course, parish charities for the poor comprise approximately between a quarter and a third. Their endowments bring in millions, yet at present with a few notable exceptions they are largely a wasted asset.<lb/>
This Bill recommends the formation of neighbourhood trusts whereby a number of trusts in a specific area, grouped together, use their joint
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0148"/>
<col>279</col>
resources to be allocated according to the wishes of the original donor. It is strange that this was first recommended in the Nathan Report of 1952 and agreed by the Charity Commission. Then again the same recommendation was made in a Select Committee Report into the accountability of the Charity Commission in 1975, and yet again in the Goodman Report of 1976. Yet still no effective action has been taken to deal with the chaotic position with regard to parochial charities in England and Wales.<lb/>
Far be it from me to outline a social history of this country, but account must be taken of certain events long ago. After Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries where, in the main, the poor were assisted, the first Queen Elizabeth instigated the Poor Law Act 1601 whereby parishes were made responsible, through overseers, to assist the poor. Alongside this civil administration the religious and humane practice grew up for donors wanting to leave money to the poor to do so using parish personnel as trustees. In those far-off days the vicar and the lord of the manor were likely to be the only ones who could write. Historically I contend that the donors left money to the poor using the parish for purposes of administration as was the practice in those days. Except in a few instances the money was not left to the parish.<lb/>
With the passing of the centuries came the development of the poor law Acts, social security Acts, national insurance and pension Acts, national health and education Acts, so that in this present age the relief of the poor falls mainly to central and local government. At the same time gradually donors tended to leave money for the poor to national and international organisations. Only a few continue to use the parish to administer their bequests.<lb/>
The Charities Act 1960, based on the recommendations of the Nathan Report, was intended to render outdated charities effective in the new situation created by welfare provisions of the modern state, while ensuring that the money continued to go to the same general purpose which the donor intended? To this end the Charities Act 1960 provided for reviews of parochial charities to be carried out in every county and for review organisers, where possible, to persuade trustees to amalgamate their charities on a voluntary basis, thus rendering them more effective.<lb/>
In May 1982, in answer to a Written Question, it was stated in <i>Hansard</i> that reviews of parochial charities had been carried out in part, or the whole, of every county in England and Wales. These reviews were usually carried out by rural community councils, charity information bureaux, and a few local authorities. Research has been carried out on eight of these reviews. Now what did this research reveal? The research revealed a generally chaotic position. First, the demographic changes in parishes. In the last two centuries there have been great shills of population. There is, for instance, a new estate with a population of 13,000 which was built only since the last war, served by four parochial charities which together bring in &#x00A3;8 a year. In the adjoining parish there are 800 people only, few of whom are in need, with an income from parochial charities of &#x00A3;3,000 or &#x00A3;4,000 a year, unable to spend it in accordance the donors' wishes. Then in Dunwich in Suffolk, once a borough with a
<col>280</col>
charter and now with a population of 155 and an income from a parochial charity of &#x00A3;1,600 a year, there is a balance sitting in the bank of &#x00A3;11,000.<lb/>
Then the research pointed out the number of outdated purposes. There is, for instance, one charity where a man centuries ago suffered grievously from a wart on his nose. He left money to anyone suffering from a similar disfigurement. This money has rarely been spent. In these days the National Health Service would take care of such a case. This money could profitably be used for allied medical problems. In the North there is a parish where bread was left to the poor. The vicar distributes to his parishioners a loaf of bread once a month, be they poor or not. I ask, is this what the donor wanted? Some trustees use money to give small Christmas presents, which does not meet the needs of those suffering real hardship. Then in another parish the vicar can claim &#x00A3;2 for preaching a sermon, and the churchwarden 50 pence for listening to it.<lb/>
The reviews also showed a lamentable neglect of accounts. Of the eight reviews in which research was done, one-third of the parochial charities had no accounts, and another quarter had kept no accounts for 10 years. The money of a proportion of the parochial charities had not been properly husbanded. Money had not been properly invested. Also some trustees of land owning charities had not revised the rents in accordance with modern standards. In some charities only &#x00A3;12 per week rent was being obtained when the average rent per week should have been &#x00A3;30. Thus, in some instances farmers who rent charity land are the largest beneficiaries of parish charities for the poor. Again, surely not in accordance with the donors' wishes.<lb/>
Then there are large unused balances. Total balances shown amount to over 18 months' income. Thus, roughly, if &#x00A3;20 million is the income of all charities in the country, it suggests that possibly there may be &#x00A3;35 million lying unused in banks. Again we come to inflation. Money left in past centuries was substantial but now the income, due to inflation, is so small as to be useless. Approximately as many as 20,000 charities may have an income of less than &#x00A3;10 per annum.<lb/>
As this stage I cannot forbear to mention a Private Member's Bill on charities now before another place. I cannot agree with the Bill, which destroys trusts which individually may have become too small to be useful. I respectfully suggest that it offends the known principle of charity law on which donors have relied&#x2014;namely, that a charity trust cannot be allowed to fail. I believe that these many small charities should be incorporated into neighbourhood trusts, as recommended in the Bill before your Lordships' House today, and not be dispersed as recommended in the Charities Bill.<lb/>
I have taken long to set the scene. To meet the welfare conditions of our modern state, to concur with the wishes of the donors who left the money for the poor, this Bill recommends that the Charity Commissioners should study the reviews of parochial charities, should ask local authorities who in turn may, as they have done in the past, allocate to voluntary organisations such as community councils the task of grouping parochial charities into neighbourhood trusts
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0149"/>
<col>281</col>
with trustees some of whom will be from the original trusts. The neighbourhood trusts will still be administered by voluntary trustees and will continue to give and be a voluntary service as hitherto. This will be of inestimable value to those needing to apply. The task of offering advice, help and supervision to the neighbourhood trusts by the Charities Commission will then be a practical proposition.<lb/>
I am fully aware that there are parishes which resent having to share their parochial charity resources with others, even if they cannot use them in accordance with the donor's wishes. The right reverend Prelate, the Bishop of London, may have something to say on this. When it was necessary because of changing social conditions for the Church to unite three or four parishes under one vicar, the position was accepted. Why, I wonder, do trustees feel unable to amalgamate into neighbourhood trusts?<lb/>
Another contention is that the county councils will need extra money to spend to allocate to voluntary organisations or, indeed, to carry out themselves this small piece of reorganisation. The cost will be infinitesimal compared with the return. It has been costed at &#x00A3;2,000 a year for two years per local authority.<lb/>
I am grateful to the Home Office for writing to me to let me know its objections to the Bill. I understand that the objections are:
<quote>"The reluctance of Trustees to co-operate with local reviews in modernising their Trusts; that Trustees should retain the right to decide what happens to the Trusts they administer and that such Trusts should be allowed to retain their identities".</quote>
I do not accept that argument when it means that the money left by donors is not being used as was intended, has been badly husbanded or is not being used at all.<lb/>
I hope that I have shown how unsatisfactory is the overall position in England and Wales. I am bound to ask: for whom are the trusts run? If they are run for the poor, which was the intention of the donors, why cannot this be made possible? I am the first to admit that there are sound, well-administered parochial charities, but they are in the minority. Thus, the Bill makes the reorganisation in neighbourhood trusts mandatory simply because there has been and is under the Charity Act 1960 the possibility of trustees voluntarily organising into neighbourhood trusts. But I must point out that, except in a few instances (and those not very satisfactory) this has not been done.<lb/>
I must say a word about the Charity Commission. In 1960, the then commission agreed with the concept of neighbourhood trusts. Since then, not only has the commission failed to deal with the many trusts which are failing both the original donors and those who should benefit, but now in 1982 the commission has changed its view on neighbourhood trusts. I am grateful to the new Charity Commissioner, Mr. Peach, and his staff for discussing the Bill with me. However, despite our good relations, I am still of the opinion that this <i>quasi</i>- independent judicial body, which is answerable to no one, should be reorganised as recommended in the Nathan Report.<lb/>
In conclusion, the central argument is that money left by donors for a specific use should be used for that use; that is the relief of poverty. If it is not possible
<col>282</col>
because of the circumstances of the bequest then the money should be used as nearly as possible in the spirit of the bequest.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01051"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not for the first time will your Lordships be grateful, from whatever portion of the House the tribute comes, to the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, for raising a matter of which she has such great knowledge in the fields of welfare and the relief of distress. On a Friday morning on which the sun seems to percolate somewhat feebly, nevertheless apparently, through your Lordships' House, it is perhaps not an original remark to make that the noble Baroness is possibly the most aptly named in your Lordships' House because she has indeed been so loyal and faithful to the causes to which she has devoted so much of her life.<lb/>
I hope that that introduction will enable the noble Baroness to realise that from these Benches, on behalf of my noble friends, we do not wish to be unhelpful to any approach to this difficult subject. It is a difficult subject and unfortunately one cannot leave it purely and simply on the basis that there is a problem to be solved in relation to the great waste that exists in parochial trusts; the relief of poverty; the many cases in which some of these trusts have become so small that they are almost useless; to the lack of administration by trustees, and many other cases of inefficient administration. All these are problems.<lb/>
I was glad that the noble Baroness mentioned the helpful possibility of a Select Committee of your Lordships' House. One wonders whether a Bill of this nature should not have further investigation, data and thought of that type about the interference with trusts which have been set up by people who have donated their own money for certain purposes.<lb/>
I wish I could say that the law on charity in this land is clear. It has a hoary antiquity which gives it grounds for our reverence; but it also lacks certainty at times, which makes all of us who are concerned with this matter a little unhappy.<lb/>
Your Lordships will know, I am sure, that we still rely for our interpretation of the law of charity upon an edict of the first Queen Elizabeth and that the rules that are quoted in regard to those charities go back to the last century when a very great lawyer, Lord Macnaghten, laid down four heads of charity: the relief of poverty; the advance of education, the advance of religion and the general good of the community.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0150"/>
<col>283</col>
Much case law has been built up and, within the case law that we have, and the rules of Macnaghten and the statute of Queen Elizabeth, many conundrums still beset the lawyer who tries to administer the law of charity. I believe that I am right in saying that the right honourable and learned gentleman the Attorney-General has had a little difficulty when trying to present common sense, as many of us see it, to the interpretation of what is charity when looking at organisations like the Moonies, and finds himself as a lawyer up against some rigidity of the law when he receives a reply from the Charity Commissioners to certain questions that he poses to them.<lb/>
It is a fact that this law is in a state of some uncertainty, but when one comes to look, as the noble Baroness asks us to look, at parochial charities, one finds that there are intense loyalties still within the parishes. If I may put it in one short sentence, the parish pump has not yet dried up in our tradition.<lb/>
I noticed, as your Lordships will have noticed, that the Bill deals not just with charities that are limited to the relief of poverty; the Bill deals with those which have as their primary object ( as well as those which have it as their sole object) the relief of poverty. There are many parochial charities where local loyalties, local loves, local devotion, have meant that there are subsidiary objects which have very definite relationships with the parish concerned.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness was fair enough and reasonable enough to admit, there are many parochial charities solely for the purpose of relief of poverty which are being very well administered. They may be small. The trustees are devoted people. Suddenly to confront them with a mandatory set of provisions, which means that very likely they are to be relieved of their trusteeship, in spite of the fact that they have been duly appointed in accordance with the wishes of the original set law, and that they are to be merged into neighbourhood trusts going beyond even the bounds of the parish, makes one think a little before saying that mandatory provisions should apply so that they are merged in neighbourhood trusts.<lb/>
My Lords, it is a Friday morning and one must not be too long in addressing your Lordships otherwise one loses one's popularity, if it exists at all, very quickly. The noble Baroness mentioned the Nathan Committee and that was a very important committee. Indeed, out of its recommendations came the 1960 Charities Act. After dealing briefly, as I have tried to do, with some of the principles behind this Bill and a question mark&#x2014;and I say merely "a question mark"&#x2014;which hangs over them, there is no doubt that something has to be done about the waste that does exist. I have no doubt about that; I am sure your Lordships have no doubt; it is just a question of the way to do it. From the point of view of practicalities, away from the principles, the first thing that one has to say&#x2014;and again the noble Baroness has said it in so many words; and I do not know whether she said it quite deliberately&#x2014;is that there are not the data procured by the Charity Commissioners which many of us would want to see before even one could say very definitely that the instruction be given to the local authorities: "Please get on with a consideration of the parochial charities within your area&#x0021; Here is a full list
<col>284</col>
of them, here are all the trustees and here are all the details".<lb/>
I believe that to impose a duty upon local authorities at this time of all times takes me back to a couple of sentences that I read at page 146 of the Nathan Report where the Committee said:
<quote>"We have considered whether it would be practicable to place an obligation on county and county borough councils to review the parochial charities in their areas and to submit proposals to the Commissioners who would then, if they thought proper, make schemes".</quote>
If I may pause for a moment, that is exactly what this Bill tries to carry out.<lb/>
The Nathan Committee was in doubt, and goes on to give the reason:
<quote>"The formidable number of these charities makes us hesitate to suggest this. It is, we think, too difficult at the present moment to estimate what would be the extent of the task, what other and perhaps more urgent tasks may be imposed on local authorities or whether it would be found practicable to give the Commissioners the staff necessary to deal with the work at the centre."</quote>
The Nathan Committee was saying something prior to 1960 which your Lordships might think, unfortunately, is very true of 1983. I say that to impose this burden on the local authorities and upon the Charity Commissioners at this moment may be very difficult. On a matter of this kind one hesitates to introduce even a hint of politics; but one has to observe that the right honourable lady the Prime Minister said with some pride at a public meeting only within the past 48 hours that the Civil Service staff was now at its lowest in numbers for the past 17 years and that in one year's time it would be the lowest since the war. As fellow practitioners with me will know, the Charity Commissioners take a very considerable time to deal with urgent correspondence on the formation of charities and on queries arising even now. The reason given for this is shortage of staff.<lb/>
The fact of the matter also is that local authorities, too, have had to cut down their staff. If the noble Lord the Minister will forgive my saying so, there are those of us who suffer now, even with his own department, when questions arise about immigration matters and naturalisation matters&#x2014;and I know that it is a different department from the one which we are now discussing. The noble Lord the Minister will know with pain and anxiety of the terrible delays that exist in dealing with correspondence. This is sometimes urgent correspondence of immigrants who do not know where they stand and of people who are applying for naturalisation, and so on, who want to try to get some security in their life. The reason given, if one asks anybody at the Home Office Immigration Department, is this. As a rule it is a very courteous reply which says: "We are trying to get on with things but we have got so many applications that we are afraid that we cannot promise to give you an answer within weeks or months".<lb/>
It is very easy to pass Bills of this type which throw upon the Charity Commissioners and local authorities very considerable burdens; but at the same time one has to look at the practicalities. You cannot take a pride in the economy in respect of numbers and at the same time take a pride in passing legislation, however good, which is going to be administered only with difficulty. By this Bill a duty is cast upon the Charity Commissioners&#x2014;a very proper duty&#x2014;to do something within 12 months, and the local authorities will
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0151"/>
<col>285</col>
have to produce schemes all over their area within five years.<lb/>
The intention of this Bill to deal with a very real problem is very good and for that the noble Baroness deserves all our thanks. There is no reason why this Bill should not be given a Second Reading. The noble Baroness said&#x2014;she will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that a Second Reading should be given to the Bill because of her proposal, which she understands to be acceptable, for a Select Committee of your Lordships to be set up in order to consider this whole problem, to find out the facts and to make practical recommendations. At that stage I hope I am right in believing that the noble Baroness would say: "We have given the Bill a Second Reading; there have been consultations, and we have these recommendations. No doubt my Bill will have to be amended, but let us get on with it." I see that the noble Baroness is nodding her charming head, so I know I am right.<lb/>
I feel that the House should give the Bill a Second Reading on this understanding. There are problems, and they ought to be solved. There is a waste. Let us see what the Select Committee of your Lordships' House has to say, and then, by all means, let us have a proper measure which is administratively possible so that it can be carried into legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01052">12.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01053"><member>Lord Foot</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a few days ago, when I was out of London, I was asked whether I would say a few words from these Benches about this Bill today. I was then in some doubt as to whether I could undertake the task, and at that stage I had not seen the Bill. But I was greatly reassured when I learned that the Bill was being promoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull. We have all learned over the years that if some case is being advocated, promoted or defended by the noble Baroness, it is almost certain to be all right. The only thing that causes me some surprise from time to time is that the noble Baroness apparently finds herself at ease on those reactionary Benches in spite of the wisdom of her speeches in this House and her devotion to all good causes.<lb/>
Having now read some literature on the matter, and having had the advantage of hearing the noble Baroness, I would have thought that some of the basic propositions on which this Bill is based would be a matter for almost general agreement. In this, I depart a little from what the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, was saying just now; but I will come back to that in a moment. I should have thought there was general agreement on the proposition of the noble Baroness that the present state of these charities, with their multiplicity of sizes, and so on, is wholly unsatisfactory. Something ought to be done about it in any event.<lb/>
I should have thought, secondly, that there was a general consensus that this problem has extended back over something like 30 years, and nothing has been achieved during those years by way of resolving it. The third matter on which I should have thought there was general agreement is that the 1960 Act was intended by its authors to provide a machinery which might cure this situation on a voluntary basis, but that in the event all those expectations and hopes were not
<col>286</col>
realised. The fourth proposition which I suggest will be generally agreed is that if a solution is to be found it is to be found in the general concept of the neighbourhood trust, as this Bill provides.<lb/>
If it be right that there would be fairly general agreement upon all those four propositions, it is on the question of whether the Bill should be mandatory that disagreement is likely to arise. I listened with care to what the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said about that, and particularly about the staffing burdens that would be imposed upon the Charity Commissioners and local authorities. I appreciate the difficulty, but I suggest it is not one which ought to kill this Bill, because one finds that the duty of the Charity Commissioners to furnish the local authorities with a list of charities in their areas is one for which they are given a period of 12 months. After that, the process of consultation by the councils with the trustees of the charities concerned may be spread over a period of five years.<lb/>
Whichever side of the House one sits on, I do not think anybody will say that our economic situation will be as serious as it is now over the whole of those five years, because if the Labour Party get back they have already promised that they will expand bureaucracy at a great rate and no doubt will give the Charity Commissioners all the assistance they require. If, on the other hand, Mrs. Thatcher is successful after the election, whenever it may occur, surely we are being led to believe by the Members opposite that within those five years she will have accomplished her economic revolution and all will be well. So whichever party wins&#x2014;and I do not, of course, discount the possibility of the Alliance winning&#x2014;it seems to me that is not a serious objection.<lb/>
But is this not the serious point?&#x2014;and, it is, I suggest, the point which might very well be examined by the Select Committee, as the noble Baroness proposes. If there is a general consensus about those propositions to which I have referred, is it not really rather deplorable that we cannot devise voluntary machinery which will accomplish the purposes of this Bill? If one looks at the record over the last 25 years, as the noble Baroness pointed out, and if one looks at the lack of progress that has been made in spite of the general wish that there should be progress, is there any reason whatever to suppose that 25 years hence we shall not be in the same position as we are now?<lb/>
In human affairs a time comes when you have to make decisions. I realise that one does not want to impose further obligations upon, for example, the local authorities. But if one is to take this matter seriously and is to have a radical reorganisation of the present unsatisfactory situation, I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary that there should be these mandatory instructions; and I hope that that is a matter which the Select Committee, in their time, will be able to resolve. Therefore, on that account, at this stage, I am strongly in favour of the noble Baroness's Bill, and I wish it every fair wind.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01055"><member>The Lord Bishop of London</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I express my support for this Bill, I must ask for the forbearance of your Lordships, if it proves necessary for me to leave before the end of the debate. I have a pastoral engagement which I have delayed but which
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0152"/>
<col>287</col>
I cannot properly cancel nor delegate, and which I must go to fulfil if need be.<lb/>
I wish to echo what has already been said in your Lordships' House about the qualities possessed by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, and to express our gratitude to her for introducing this Bill. She has made very clear the reasons which make some reform of local charities urgently necessary&#x2014;necessary, not merely as a matter of administrative tidiness, or for a better use of available resources, but as a matter of justice to the poor and the needy to whom belong the charities which are dealt with by this Bill. It is often forgotten, as the noble Baroness has pointed out, that they belong not to the parishes but to the poor and needy, and, in my judgment, the Bill enables their assets to be used for the benefit of those to whom they were given.<lb/>
I believe that the Bill has the general support of those who sit on these Benches. I might add that the representatives of the main denominations who sit on the Churches Main Committee, of which I am chairman, have considered the Bill and expressed support in principle for the general objective. They would, I am sure, as I would myself, welcome the setting up of a Select Committee of your Lordships' House which could consider the best methods of achieving it and to which they might be allowed to give evidence.<lb/>
There are, I believe, many excellent reasons for supporting this Bill, but I shall confine myself to mentioning two of them. The first is that it is based on the fine English tradition of adaptation to meet new circumstances. I must confess that I was a little surprised to hear the conservative advocacy of the <i>status quo</i> by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. I look more to that flexibility which has given strength to our nation, and which has enabled progress to be made by evolution rather than by revolution or destruction.<lb/>
The Bill which is being considered in another place, and to which the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, has referred, does not follow this tradition. It is based on a policy not of adaptation, but of destruction&#x2014;and of destruction not merely of parochial charities which, as it were, are allowed to wither away, but also of the voluntary element which has played such an important part in meeting social needs in this country. I believe that a policy which is based on co-operation between voluntary effort and state provision is sound and is the best for our nation. It is this policy, I believe, upon which the Bill is based.<lb/>
The present situation in regard to parochial charities does not encourage voluntary care at the local level and it is not surprising that people are now more disposed to contribute to national appeals and so on. But I believe that parochial concern should be encouraged. In that respect, I echo much of what the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said about the importance of the parish pump, and I believe that by the formation of neighbourhood trusts much could be done to encourage local support.<lb/>
My second point is that the Bill is based on partnership and sharing, which is something I wish to encourage. We who sit on these Benches are sometimes accused of preaching what we do not practise. There are, no doubt, occasions when this
<col>288</col>
charge is fully justified. We are as Christians aware that, for us, these Benches are penitent Benches, but in this matter I believe that our penitence can rightly be muted, for the Church of England, through the Church Commissioners&#x2014;as the noble Baroness has already briefly indicated&#x2014;has, with the full approval of Parliament, sought to pursue a policy by which parochial endowments have been shared in such a way that all parishes benefit to the greatest possible extent.<lb/>
There is an interesting parallel between the Charity Commissioners and the Church Commissioners, which have been operating for very much the same length of time. The basis is not very dissimilar, but the difference in the method of operation is remarkable. The Charity Commissioners have tended to look at each trust in isolation and primarily, as regards their legal commitments, have treated trusts as if they existed for the parish and not for the poor, which has led in large measure to our situation today. The Church Commissioners, on the other hand&#x2014;formerly, before 1948, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners&#x2014;have, with the approval of Parliament, consistently sought to see how the parochial endowments could be so used as to enable the purpose for which they were given to be fulfilled in the best way.<lb/>
So it was that in 1975, when presenting the Endowment and Glebe Measure to the General Synod for final approval, the then First Estates Church Commissioner, Sir Ronald Harris, could say that any suggestion that by passing this Measure the Synod would somehow be doing something novel and out of keeping with the history and ethos of our Church would be to ignore history. He went on to say that for some 150 years action has been in train under the authority of Parliament to redistribute endowments. Of the establishment of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1836, it has been said that it represented the establishment, or rather the re-establishment, by Parliament of a principle; namely, that the benefits of a trust should be applied to those who needed them and were not to be attached to a place or a person irrespective of need.<lb/>
I make this comparison between the working of the two bodies&#x2014;the Charity Commissioners and the Church Commissioners&#x2014;because I have heard it argued that it would be something quite new for us to agree to the trusts of one parish being shared with those of another. I cannot see that there is any justification for saying that a new principle would be established, because of the principle which has operated throughout with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and now with the Church Commissioners. I cannot see, when Parliament initiated and has continued to approve a policy of sharing parochial trusts by the Church Commissioners, there is any reason why the similar principle should not be applied to parochial trusts for the poor.<lb/>
I am, of course, well aware that the amalgamation of parishes and of endowments has not taken, and does not take, place without sadness and regret, and perhaps at times even pain. But it cannot be denied that, without such amalgamation and sharing, the present pastoral provision for the parishes of this country which is now made would have been impossible.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0153"/>
<col>289</col>
But I would make two points. First, provision has been made in the legislation under which the Church and the Church Commissioners operate for the views of interested parties to be made known and taken into account, with the right of appeal. I find it difficult to see why some similar provisions could not be made available for those who would be affected by this Bill. In view of what has been said about the administrative arrangements, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, I would say that what has been achieved by the Church Commissioners in a relatively short time, and with great administrative despatch, is very remarkable. That is a tribute to the way in which the matter has been handled and organised. I do not believe that it is so difficult as is sometimes made out. I would also point out that the actual number of appeals in cases which come to the Church Commissioners is relatively small. I do not think that the number would be significantly greater in the case of proposals for the sharing of parochial trusts.<lb/>
The second point I want to make is that, much as we may regret, in some ways, the need to share and amalgamate parishes, and so on, the fact is that we are now spared the unedifying and scandalous spectacle of underemployed clergymen in tiny villages enjoying large incomes while their brother priests work their hearts out on a pittance in neighbouring large, industrial parishes. It was scandals and injustices of this kind which led Parliament to establish the Ecclesiastical Commission.<lb/>
In the sphere of parochial charities for the poor, scandals and injustice exist today. Your Lordships may feel that those words are too strong. I do not believe that they are. I do not believe that it does the concept of a charity or trust any good to allow the present situation to continue as it is. We have the scandal of the situation in which trustees have more money at their disposal than they can possibly spend on the benefits of the trust as it stands. We have the scandal of resources remaining unused because the purpose of the trust cannot be fulfilled. I know from personal experience as a parish priest that we have the injustice of those who cannot receive the help which they sorely need because they live on the wrong side of the street which forms the parish boundary.<lb/>
The Charities Act 1960 defined the functions of the Charity Commissioners as being to promote the effective use of charitable resources. I do not believe, with all the charity I can muster, that they can be said to have fulfilled this function. I believe that a Bill of this kind is necessary if the Charity Commissioners are to do so and if action is to be stimulated. As has already been pointed out in your Lordships' House, nothing has happened since that Act was passed and some action is needed to stimulate reform. I believe, particularly after hearing what the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, said about the prospects of a Select Committee being set up, that the Bill will give stimulus for this matter to be dealt with. It is, I believe, a matter of injustice, of wrong use of resources, to allow the assets of our charities to remain as they are. It is a Christian duty to use resources in the best way for the relief of those in need and to encourage care for one another's needs by sharing one's goods. It is because I seek to respond to that duty that I urge your Lordships to vote today for the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

This seems to me to be a matter of some concern to your Lordships' House and of general concern to those who feel not only that policy must be right but that we need to have the machinery by which policy can be made effective.<lb/>
If we were to begin by creating a body to supervise charitable endowments in this country, I believe we should expect it to perform four functions. We should expect it to perform the function of registration, which means seeing that charities conform to the law and are properly, therefore, to be treated as charities by taxing and other authorities. That, no doubt, the present Charity Commission has, with some bizarre exceptions, fulfilled to the best of its ability, and on that score there is little at which to cavil.<lb/>
Secondly, we should expect that body to supervise the activities of trustees in order to make sure that they keep their accounts in a proper fashion and that they treat their endowments so as to produce the maximum benefit for those for whom those endowments were intended. The researches to which I have referred seem to reveal grave lacunae: trustees who hardly ever present proper accounts and trustees who, as the noble Baroness has pointed out, let the land which is the basis of the endowment for much less rent than could reasonably be obtained for the benefit of the poor to whom the money should go.<lb/>
Thirdly, we should expect such a body to have complete knowledge, complete statistics, of charities all over the country. They should know where they exist and what are their resources and purposes. I do not disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, who said that we need to give this matter a great deal more

thought and that we also need better statistics, more data, more information. But, after the 30 years which have elapsed since this matter was first considered and the period of over 20 years since the Act which we are talking about was passed, one would have thought that the Charity Commission would have at its fingertips the knowledge which local authorities require and that it should be a matter of telephoning and sending down a Xerox copy of an existing set of documents. If the Charity Commission have not done this, surely they have behaved in a way which would not be expected of the Church Commissioners in relation to their own endowments&#x2014;nor, indeed, of other bodies which supervise the expenditure of money.<lb/>
The fourth point&#x2014;perhaps the most important point of all which relates most closely to the object of the Bill&#x2014;is that the commission should have some degree of initiative. Just as, as the right reverend Prelate has told us, the Church has looked closely at the way in which its resources can best be spent for the purposes for which they were originally given, so one would expect the Charity Commission to realise that, even if the law dates from the first Elizabeth, we live in the reign of the second, that the basic function of private charity now must be to supplement the work of the welfare state, and that this clearly means looking at whether this is a genuine supplement or whether, as in the case of the vicar distributing loaves of bread, it would appear to be superflous. This initiative appears to be wholly lacking, otherwise the voluntary principle which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, pins his faith to or asks that we should pin our faith to would surely have had a better run over the past 20 years than emerges from these reports.<lb/>
If, therefore, we have a Select Committee on this most important Bill, I hope that it will feel itself free to look at the machinery through which these neighbourhood trusts, if they come into being&#x2014;as I hope they will&#x2014;are supervised, because they in turn may be found wanting in some respects as social conditions and need change.<lb/>
If one asks why the Charity Commissioners have not done these things and why they now require to be done, one can give two answers&#x2014;one specific, and one more general. The specific answer (and this was referred to by the right reverend Prelate) is the business of treating each trust as a separate entity without regard to its possible relationship to other trusts. This is regarding the commission as a form of law court; a body separate from the machinery of Government and mainly concerned with adjudicating questions, such as whether or not a particular charity has the right to registration.<lb/>
There is a more general answer, which is that it is no longer proper, whatever may have been the case in the past, for a body which does affect the expenditure of what are still, by any standards, quite considerable sums of money to be so removed and remote from our general machinery of Government&#x2014;whether parliamentary or administrative. The Select Committee might therefore look at two possibilities. First, that the Charity Commissioners should be made responsible, as the Parliamentary Commission of Administration is, to a parliamentary committee. In this case, clearly, and particularly in view of your Lordships' experience
<col>292</col>
in these matters, it ought to be a Joint Select Committee of both Houses.<lb/>
Alternatively, that its present rather remote relationship with the Home Office&#x2014;which is exemplified by the fact that we are to hear the arguments it has against the Bill from the mouth of the Minister representing that department in your Lordships' House&#x2014;should be substituted with a relationship of a more intimate kind with the department which spends hundreds and thousands of times as much money on assistance to the needy&#x2014;namely, the Department of Health and Social Security. It seems quite absurd that there should be this gap between private charity and&#x2014;using the word in no derogatory sense&#x2014;public charity. The fact that a Minister from the Department of Health and Social Security has not participated in this debate highlights the weakness in our governmental arrangements, which I should like to draw to your Lordships' attention.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01061"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to give positive support to the Bill which has been introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithful, because I am satisfied that the <i>status quo</i> is not the answer. The House must be indebted to the noble Baroness for introducing this Bill and for the considerable volume of research which she and her small team of volunteers have collected over a short period of time. All that is relevant when one comes to consider the inactivity of the past 20 years on the part of other people.<lb/>
The passing of the Charities Act 1960&#x2014;and there has been a great deal of reference to that Act this morning&#x2014;was a monumental achievement. Parliament in its wisdom made it possible for trustees to modify the objects in accordance with the spirit of the gift where such objects had become outmoded. That was made possible by the famous Section 13, which allowed charities to merge, to widen their area of benefit, or to take other steps to enable a charity to make the most effective use of its property&#x2014;again, within the spirit of the gift. This morning we have not heard of Section 18 of the 1960 Act: but under that section the Act placed trustees under a duty to apply for a scheme to alter the objects in certain circumstances. I will return to that point in a minute or two.<lb/>
The 1960 Act therefore had considerable potential. It provided the mechanism to promote better investment (and we have heard this morning of the scandalous state of investment in many of the trusts) and more effective administration and application of charitable property, to enable the ancient charities to play a positive role in the modern welfare state. However we have heard time and again this morning that the evidence shows that Section 13 has not been activated as one would wish. There may have been a misplaced sense of loyalties, but there has also been a great deal of sheer apathy.<lb/>
In general, trustees have not grasped the initiative which was theirs to take. Since the period 1960 to 1965, the Charity Commissioners appear to have been content to exercise a passive role. One often hears of the Charity Commissioners' preference for saying "No". Since 1960&#x2013;65, the Charity Commissioners do not appear to have seen it to be their role to facilitate
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0155"/>
<col>293</col>
and encourage charities to take advantage of the provisions of the 1960 Act to attain their aims. I believe that this negative response is tantamount to denying the existence of the problem; a problem that was recognised by Parliament a quarter of a century ago. We should not underestimate the significance of this non-activity.<lb/>
It will be interesting to learn from the noble Lord the Minister&#x2014;either today or later&#x2014;how often the commissioners have exercised the power available to them under Section 18 to request the Home Secretary to refer a case to them where they are satisfied that the interests of the charity require a scheme but that the trustees have unreasonably refused or neglected to do so. The critical question posed by the noble Baroness is: How do we move forward so as to give effect to the principles of the 1960 Act and to the spirit of the donor's intentions?<lb/>
We have heard that the Bill proposes a merger of parochial charities for the relief of poverty to form neighbourhood trusts to serve a group of parishes; and that a duty will be placed on the county councils (to be exercised over a period of five years&#x2014;not 12 months) to prepare the necessary recommendations to the commissioners. We have seen already in the 1960 Act the principles of merger and of widening the area of beneficial benefit. So the new principle (and I am not so sure that it is new, given Section 18 of the 1960 Act) is the mandatory requirement. I agree with my noble friend Lord Foot: is that requirement to kill the Bill?<lb/>
I support this Bill because something has to be done and I believe that this Bill takes the right approach. I wish to refer briefly to three matters in the light of our experience in Wales, where there is considerable concern about the inactivity of the ancient charities and where a steering committee has already been established to review the position and to make recommendations. The first point is a very minor one. The Bill throughout refers to parishes, which no longer exist in the Principality. It therefore requires a minor amendment so that the word "parish" is construed to mean a community.<lb/>
Secondly, one would wish to know why the Bill is confined to those parochial charities whose aim is the relief of poverty. It has been put to me that in Wales there are probably more educational trusts than trusts for the relief of poverty. The state of the statistics is poor, and I am unable to verify that that is so, but I would wish to know why it is not extended to cover educational trusts. It may be that one cannot at this stage place an additional burden on the various authorities, and that I would accept, but in due course the educational trusts will also require proper consideration in legislation.<lb/>
The third point is that in any scheme of reorganisation of the Charity Commissioners&#x2014;this is not dealt with in the Bill, but reference has been made more than once to the role of the Charity Commissioners in the modern state&#x2014;there is a need for the Charity Commissioners to establish a separate Welsh Office in Wales to which responsibility for oversight of Welsh charities could be transferred. The geographical area would not be extensive. Such an office would be close, or closer, to the eight county councils and to
<col>294</col>
most Welsh charities. I believe that in co-operation with the county councils it could build up a bank of up-to-date standardised statistics about Welsh charities, and it would also relieve the burden on the Liverpool office of the commission and make it possible to bring a greater concentration to bear on the needs of the Welsh charities.<lb/>
So, my Lords, initiative to integrate the ancient parochial trusts, and where necessary to reformulate their objects in order to achieve the donor's aim, is long overdue. Once again one says that the <i>status quo</i> is not an option. I believe that this Bill offers a new, practical and relevant approach to the problem, and it has many merits, which I trust will commend themselves to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01063"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to congratulate my noble friend Lady Faithfull very much on bringing this Bill before us. I also very much support the idea of it being committed to a Select Committee; and I am delighted to hear that the Government agree with that approach. I will touch on only one or two small points, because the Bill has been very well dealt with by other speakers.<lb/>
Before tackling the problem of supporting the Bill I consulted, as I do in these cases, the Isle of Wight County Council. It is, I think, of some interest that they indeed tried to make a list of the charities and to investigate them in 1977. They persuaded the junior branch of Rotary to do it. But in the event it was not found a suitable task for a group of young persons, so the work was not done, and nothing has been done since. I think that, perhaps&#x2014;and here I would pick up a point made by my noble friend Lord Beloff&#x2014;had the matter been one for the Department of the Environment there might have been just that little more pressure, and acceptance of pressure by the counties, for this to be got on with; but because it was the Home Office, to which they do not directly report and which does not give them money in the ordinary sense, they perhaps did not. I know my noble friend has said that it should be the DHSS, but I do not think that would improve the position. I think there is a problem of the work in the counties, and I think this is something that will need to be examined by the Select Committee.<lb/>
If, as my noble friend Lady Faithfull says, it is only a cost of &#x00A3;2,000 a year for two years, that is fine; but that needs to be properly established. Also, I think the counties should be encouraged to use voluntary groups to do it. It might even be almost an understood thing that that is the way in which it should be done. At the time I am speaking of, in 1977, the counties were not short of staff in the sense that they perhaps now are, to which the noble Lord, Lord Mischon, called our attention. It could be that it would be more difficult now. I think this is a point we have to study: how it is done and who by, not unnecessarily burdening the counties with the task.<lb/>
The other point I took from the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, with which I agreed is the difficulty of persuading people to join in such a scheme as this. It is a shame that the right reverend Prelate has had to leave, because I have experience of church parishes being amalgamated and of the rivalries and difficulties
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0156"/>
<col>295</col>
that that can cause. I think it could well be that there are some charities which should be allowed, at any rate initially, to opt out of the neighbourhood trusts scheme. Of course, if they could show the Charity Commissioners, presumably, that they were a well-established charity and were being properly run, that there were suitable people existing to benefit from the charity, and a few obvious points like that&#x2014;there could be some sort of guidelines&#x2014;and if they satisfied all those criteria, they could be left alone for the time being.<lb/>
One would hope that the neighbourhood trusts would grow in such a way that these other charities might be attracted to them in due course. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that one needs to go very carefully to ensure that one is not treading unnecessarily on the toes of those operating something which is working in this particular area. I think the Bill is perhaps a little too compulsory. I can see why it is. Perhaps one should have some sort of let-out on the lines I have described, and the Select Committee might look into that.<lb/>
My final point is in relation to the Charity Commissioners. I must say they seem to have come out of this extraordinarily badly. I entirely agree with the general theme of what my noble friend Lord Beloff had to say. I should like my noble friend the Minister to tell me, if he can, when he comes to make his contribution to the debate, who the commissioners are. What sort of people are they? Are they civil servants, or are they lawyers? Are they of this generation, or is it necessary to be over 90 before you are a charity commissioner? There must be some explanation for it. Who selects them, and what sort of criteria do they have in selecting them? Something desperately needs to be done to bring them into the 20th century, and to do it before the 21st century is upon us.<lb/>
I really think this is something that needs to be dealt with, quite separately from this Bill and from the need for it to be progressed through its Select Committee. I think the Church Commissioners&#x2014;I mean, of course, the Charity Commissioners; I hesitate to say the Church Commissioners, and if my noble friend Lord Sandford were here he would be very upset&#x2014;need a long hard look taken at them, and perhaps we should sack the lot and start again. But I hope very much that we will encourage this Bill to go forward, and that it will in some form or other eventually reach the statute book.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01065"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, like other noble Lords, I would wish to pay my own tribute to my noble friend Lady Faithfull, without whose initiative we should not, in all probability, be discussing this very important subject which bears upon the humanities. It is at her request that I speak in this debate, but I have no expertise whatever in charity law. It is not my purpose to criticise any Government department, or any division of work between Government departments, or the Charity Commissioners, but to support the board case for committal to a Select Committee which was advanced by noble Lords who have spoken before me in this debate, including of course the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London.<lb/>
<col>296</col>
As the noble Lord, Lord Foot, said, there is general consensus on the need for investigation. I support the Second Reading in order to support the Motion for committal. But in this context it is relevant, in submission, to consider the Bill which, I understand, is about to passs in another place this afternoon; not at length, but very briefly. That Bill, which is to enable the property of small charities to be extended without regard to restrictions distinguishing between capital and income, will, it is understood, be opposed by certain of your Lordships, including my noble friend Lady Faithfull, not only on the issue of what is meant by value but on the fundamental issue of whether the Bill would not operate to destroy those ancient legacies to the detriment of the poor.<lb/>
To this Bill now before your Lordships' House, which seeks amalgamation of parochial charities into neighbourhood trusts in order to preserve these legacies, it surely is relevant to consider that this will destroy nothing but will unlock dead funds and put them to some useful charitable purpose. These provisions include resort to the mandatory provisions of Clause 4. For some this would be too draconian. If I may borrow the observations of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon (and it is not for the first time I find myself in total agreement with him) one must approach this with a considerable measure of care. That is one of the reasons why I am supporting the Second Reading&#x2014;so that there should be this investigation.<lb/>
With the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Foot, who thought otherwise, I adopt here the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. I do not know if this was the thought of my noble friend Lord Mottistone&#x2014;and I agree with him in the principle of his concept&#x2014;but perhaps there should be a form of appellate procedure which could be invoked by any interested party so that the recommendation of the local council, which, subject to modification under Clause 4 by the commissiners becomes the scheme for the amalgamation of the charities, may be subject to general review by some revisory tribunal or court, even perhaps the Privy Council. It is a very important matter concerning the rights of donors, where the future of the willingness of people to give is concerned and where the more prestigious the tribunal perhaps the more appropriate it would be.<lb/>
Is it not evident that on any showing there must be a measure of reorganisation of these parochial charities, quite outside the question of charities generally? The question is: what should be done about it? On that question there is, as has been observed, again by the noble Lord, Lord Mischcon, no substantial unanimity. It is common ground that we should do something but we are not agreed on what we should do. Is not this the classic situation where we should refer the matter, by committal, to a Select Committe? Indeed, is it not unneccessary, and indeed unwise, to allow two Bills which lie in conflict and which purport to deal with the same subject to entertain the time of your Lordships' House? Would it not be fare more preferable that we should have the benefit of those who are really skilled in this esoteric subject of charity law to assist us with our deliberations before we debate either of these Bills?<lb/>
I have no intention of detaining your Lordships by seeking to canvass the merits of either Bill. That would
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0157"/>
<col>297</col>
be quite contrary to the main tenor of my submissions to your Lordships that the merits or demerits are relatively immaterial in the form of drafting and the form of purpose of these Bills. What matters is that we should receive expert assistance from the Select Committee in order to know how we should deal with them.<lb/>
In conclussion, I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Foot, that it is no use saying that the voluntary reorganisation is a runner at all. Nothing will happen. I take, with gratitude, the point made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London, who observed that adaptation by statute is the only way forward and that we should free ourselves from the legalistic approach of the Charity Commissioners. By using the words "legalistic approach" in relation to a body set up to apply the law I am not seeking to criticise them. At this stage criticism, in submission, is totally idle. What we need is information and advice.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01067"><member>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to express my appreciation of the initiative taken by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, my general sympathy with the objectives of the Bill and, in particular, my support for the proposed reference to a Select Committee.<lb/>
Some of us have from time to time urged a review of the general law relating to charities and I, too, derive some comfort from seeing that the Attorney-General, to judge from remarks in another place, is now coming round to that view. But, although the debate today&#x2014;inevitably, I suppose&#x2014;has tended to go a little wide, what we are, or at any rate ought to be, concentrating on is just one aspect that, happily, does not raise any great political or philosophical question&#x2014;subject to the one point about staff to which I shall come in a moment. Certainly what has been said in the debate demonstrates that all we are talking about is something of much greater significance than one might be tempted to think at first sight.<lb/>
Some rather unkind things have been said about the Charity Commissioners. I do not propose to lengthen my speech by answering all the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, tempting though that is. However, I do believe that they have been handicapped by a lack of resources, for which historically I suppose I must accept some responsibility, and also by the somewhat confusing development of the law over the years both in Parliament and in the courts. Perhaps we need a new Charities Act, but certainly the Act of 1960, which reconstituted the commission and redefined its responsibilities, has turned out in some respects to have been lacking in precision, and it has indeed failed to meet some of the high hopes that were placed in it.<lb/>
I took the trouble to re-read some of the debates on that Bill, and have been reminded of the importance which the Government of the day attached to the section authorising the review of local charities by local authorities and the contribution which they hoped these reviews would make towards promoting the more effective use of charitable resources. Unfortunately, though, this section did not attempt to define the purposes of these local reviews, and the picture which was conjured up of the Charity
<col>298</col>
Commissioners, the local authorities and the charity trustees working together in harmonious co-operation to bring the local charities up to date and to avoid overlap with the statutory services does strike one as being&#x2014;how shall I put it?&#x2014;idealistic.<lb/>
Nor has the register of charities set up under the Act proved to be the mine of information one had rather hoped for. Previous speakers have referred to the lack of precise information. One must say that we are today discussing the future of parochial charities for the poor without any precise knowledge of how many charities there are, what assets they have, what they spend their money on, what their income is&#x2014;still less what their income ought to be, given the point the noble Baroness made about the tenant farmers using charitable land for which they pay what is now a ridiculously low rent.<lb/>
On 27th May last (col. 1358 of <i>Hansard),</i> I asked the Government how many local and parochial charities having a permanent endowment were registered in three of the four groups as laid down in the Macnaghten judgment&#x2014;that is for the relief of poverty, for the advancement of education and for other purposes beneficial to the community. I did not ask about those for the advancement of religion. I was told in reply that no distinction was made in the register between charities having a permanent endowment and others, and that this information&#x2014;which was not actually what I had asked for&#x2014;could be obtained only by examining the individual deeds, the cost of which would be disproportionate. My Lords, I can only say, Alas&#x0021;
But I agree with what I understood to be the point that the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, was making: that the absence of detailed information is not of itself a reason for sweeping the whole issue under the carpet and that if we do nothing there seems to be no likelihood of anything better emerging on its own initiative. We do know quite a bit, as the noble Baroness has said, from the county reviews. We know that there are a great many parochial charities which do not have very much money, but we know that there are quite a number which have a great deal. In spite of the picture which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, painted for us in such moving terms about the application and loyalty of the local trustees, I am afraid we do know that a great deal of the income is not being usefully and imaginatively applied. We know, too, that there is very little sign of the consultation between trustees and the statutory bodies that had been hoped for. What is perhaps even more important, there is very little sign either of anything being done voluntarily to make things better.<lb/>
The crux of the problem dealt with by the Bill seems to me to be this. These charities were endowed for the relief of the poor and not for the amenities of the parish. It was quite natural at the time for the parish to be taken as the unit, since in the days of the Poor Laws each parish was responsible for its own poor. But, leaving aside the very tiny charities, in many areas it is now possible to ensure that the money is sensibly used for the relief of the poor in ways not covered by the welfare state only by enlarging the area of operation. The argument for the Bill is that it is much more in keeping with the intentions of the donors to do this, rather than to go on dribbling the income away in pretty useless doles; or, alternatively, departing from
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0158"/>
<col>299</col>
the wishes of the donors and ceasing to use the money for the relief of poverty, diverting it instead to amenities within the parish. This is the main purpose of the Bill, as I understand it, and I go along with it.<lb/>
There are one or two aspects of the Bill itself about which I am not altogether happy, but this is not the time at which to go into detail about them. But I may perhaps just mention that I am a little uneasy about the definition of the objects of neighbourhood trusts, as set out in Clause 5. I am not sure what the sanction is if the local authority fails to put in its proposals within the five years specified in, I think, Clause 4. But points of this kind&#x2014;and there are quite a few&#x2014;can be threshed out later.<lb/>
But before I sit down I should like to comment very briefly on two of the other objections to the Bill which have been voiced by Home Office Ministers&#x2014;contrary though it is to my whole upbringing to voice the slightest doubt about their views. The first one is the point about staff. I understand the fears, but I think that it is possible to exaggerate them. Some of the preliminary work must have been done in the county reviews; and, so far as the counties are concerned, the further demands should be quite modest and voluntary bodies of a suitable kind could be called upon to help. So far as the Charity Commission is concerned, they already manage to put through each year a substantial number of amalgamation schemes of a rather different type&#x2014;174 of them in 1981&#x2014;and the end result of setting up neighbourhood schemes would mean such considerable economies for them in future in having to deal with fewer boards of trustees that some additional effort should be well worth while.<lb/>
A second objection was that to compel the trustees of these old schemes to combine would deter potential donors now. I am sorry, but I simply do not understand this objection. No one is coming forward now to set up new parochial schemes for the poor, and I really should be surprised if anyone were put off making a charitable contribution simply because better effect was being given to the desires of people who endowed charities a long time ago. But if there is anything in the point, it must apply with rather greater force to this other Bill about small charities which appears on the agenda in another place this very day, and which, for some unaccountable reason, seems to have received some sympathy from Her Majesty's Government.<lb/>
But I will leave it there, apart from striking just a note of warning about the extent of the remit of any Select Committee which is appointed, given some of the comments which have been made in the debate. I shall sit down, again saying that I support the proposals of the noble Baroness.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01069"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have just two small reasons for wishing to give the Bill my wholehearted support. First, like so many of your Lordships, at one time I lived in a village. The village had a small parochial trust, which was quite out of step with the current situation. This was the cause of very much thought and concern to dutiful inhabitants and parish councillors, who almost wished that it would go away.<lb/>
<col>300</col>
It seemed like fantasy. There was good money, and it was a puzzle to know how to spend it.<lb/>
Secondly, a few years ago I was sent to work for several days on researching at the headquarters of the Charity Commissioners, to discover suitable charities to approach for a project with which I was connected. I was amazed by the lack of cross-referencing and up-to-date details afforded by the files. It was a question of wading through stacks of amazingly dusty files. Although I was very grateful to have permission to do this, I was much less grateful for the billows of dust from the files&#x2014;dust which enveloped me and triggered off my asthma.<lb/>
This exercise certainly aroused my interest in the Charity Commissioners. I was very ignorant about them. Who were they, and what made them tick? The nearest answer at which I arrived was that they are a <i>quasi</i>-quango, a <i>quasi</i>-judicial body, apparently accountable to nobody, but with the Home Office as their spokesman. From what I saw for myself it seems extremely unlikely that they have any necessarily detailed grass-root information on the numerous parochial charities on the scale that is needed today. Without this they can be in no position to administer the charities, as presumably was intended.<lb/>
I congratulate my noble friend Lady Faithfull on her customary skill and her adroit handling of a very delicate matter, and I am delighted to support the Bill's provisions. I hope that with the help of my noble friend the Minister the Bill will lead eventually to the funds in question being made available for the many needy rural and other causes that surely exist today.</membercontribution></p>

She has given us an admirable survey of the long history of the charities with which her Bill is concerned. She has also illustrated their great diversity, not always with examples designed exclusively for the benefit of the poor. I was particularly taken with the foundation which offered &#x00A3;2 to a preacher to preach, and 50 pence to the church wardens to listen. That is an interesting principle. If it were applied to this Dispatch Box and these Benches, I dare say that it would be necessary to reverse the proportions in order to secure an attendance.<lb/>

My noble friend has made the suggestion that the Bill should be handled by a Select Committee. I believe that that is a constructive suggestion, and it is one which the Government would not wish to obstruct. As my noble friend said, this is a complex field, fraught with a lot of difficulty, and not a little emotion. My noble friend's desire is to see the large, but fragmented, amounts of money in local charities brought to bear with greater effectiveness on real and pressing problems. While we sympathise with that, we have grave doubts as to whether what she proposes in the Bill sits well either with the spirit in which many of these monies were given, or indeed with the doctrine of <i>cy-pr&#x00E8;s,</i> which lies properly at the heart of existing requirements for the change of the purposes of charitable trusts.<lb/>
This difficult ground seems to me appropriate to be worked by a diligent Select Committee. This is in itself a large and potentially fruitful field. It could only suffer if it were to be dealt with in haste, and the pressures of the parliamentary timetable would almost certainly introduce an element of haste into any treatment accorded it by a Committee of the Whole House. But to widen the terms of reference as my noble friend Lord Beloff suggests, to cover the whole field of charities and their administration, would I think be to overload the consideration, and here I echo the wise, cautionary words of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale.<lb/>
It is not in any case what my noble friend is proposing, and I would not feel free to support it if it was; nor do I feel that my noble friend Lord Trefgarne is at fault, if that was my noble friend Lord Beloff's suggestion. I do not think that my noble friend Lord Trefgarne is at fault in his absence from this debate. My noble friend Lord Beloff should not suppose that Ministers are so little pressed in their work that they can afford to attend personally every debate in which they may have an interest when responsibility rests properly in the hands of another.<lb/>
We are talking of a Select Committee, and a Select Committee stands out of the pattern of the main traffic of committees, and I am perfectly content that my noble friend's Bill should be handled as she proposes.<lb/>
However in the absence of such a proposal, I should have found it difficult not to pour a great deal of cold water onto the Bill, despite the fact that all of us share my noble friend's desire to see the resources of charities, both large and small, used to their greatest effect. We are well aware of the nature of the problem. Of the 144,000 charities registered with the Charity Commissioners, well over half have an annual income of less than &#x00A3;100. It is right that we should be concerned with the proper and relevant use of funds donated, sometimes hundreds of years ago, when some of the needs of the poor were very different from their needs today.<lb/>
I think I heard my noble friend say that the value of the charities is &#x00A3;35 million. If the value is really as high as that&#x2014;and I say this in ignorance of her grounds for
<col>302</col>
stating it; I take leave to doubt it&#x2014;it would arouse avarice. If, as I think, it is less, it still arouses a considerable and legitimate interest.<lb/>
The Charities Act 1960 specifically entrusts the Charity Commissioners with the responsibility,
<quote>"of promoting the effective use of charitable resources by encouraging the development of better methods of administration, by giving charity trustees information or advice on any matter affecting the charity".</quote>
Moreover, they must so act,
<quote>"in the case of any charity (unless it is a matter of altering its purposes) as best to promote and make effective the work of the charity in meeting the needs designated by its trusts".</quote>
Your Lordships will not need reminding that under the <i>cy-pr&#x00E8;s</i> doctrine the purpose of a charitable trust can be altered by the Charity Commissioners in certain circumstances, so long as the new purposes are as near as possible to the old ones. Certain procedures have to be followed, including the advertising of the proposals and the consideration of objections. I need not elaborate upon this now, except to emphasise the point that the commissioners' scheme-making power can be exercised only on a voluntary basis, on application by the trustees. The commissioners may, however, proceed on application by certain parties other than the trustees where the charity's income is not more than &#x00A3;50.<lb/>
There is also power to proceed by compulsion where the commissioners are satisfied that the trustees ought to have applied for a scheme but have unreasonably refused or neglected to do so, and the Secretary of State endorses the commissioners' view. That power which resides in Section 18 of the Act has never yet been exercised. That answers the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Mottistone asked me who and, indeed, what the Charity Commissioners are. The Charity Commission is a Government department, but its functions on individual charities are <i>quasi-</i>judicial, and in these it is entirely independent of all Government Ministers. There are, as the Charities Act 1960 requires, three commissioners, of whom at least two must be lawyers. They are appointed by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. The present chief commissioner was appointed in March last year, after selection through open competition. I must again emphasise that in their <i>quasi</i>-judicial functions the commissioners are not subject to direction by the Government, and also that with one exception, which I have already mentioned, they have no power to act independently, on their own initiative. They cannot therefore have had the opportunity to avoid the criticism of my noble friend that they have shown no initiative.<lb/>
The 1960 Act also makes provision for local authority reviews of local charities in England and Wales. Section 11 empowers local authorities to initiate reviews of their local charities. They,
<quote>"may make to the Commissioners such report on the review and such recommendations arising from it as the council after consultation with the trustees think fit".</quote>
The charity trustees must consent to the review.<lb/>
The question of the charity trustees' consent to these reviews was considered very carefully at the Committee stage of that Bill in this House. The noble Lord, Lord Saltoun, expressing fears that a local authority
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0160"/>
<col>303</col>
might exert undue pressure on local charities to agree to a review, moved an amendment to Clause 11 that reviews of local charities should be initiated by the Charity Commissioners at the request of the local authority. The noble Lord, Lord Silkin, thought that local authorities should be able to carry out a review without the consent of the trustees, and moved an amendment to that effect. Neither amendment was accepted after the then Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Viscount, Lord Kilmuir, had explained that the main purpose of the clause was a partnership in which both sides worked together voluntarily so that the best use might be made of their respective resources.<lb/>
I can only echo those words. I think that it would be an unjustifiable infringement of partnership and cooperation on an equal basis&#x2014;saving the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, who, not for the first time, I believe, has ventured out of the safe ground delineated by his long experience to criticise the department&#x2014;if the local authority could carry out reviews without the consent of the trustees. I must apologise to your Lordships for having dwelt at such lengths on the provisions of the Charities Act. I hope your Lordships will agree that it already provides a legislative framework for the review and modernisation of parochial charities.<lb/>
I must nevertheless accept the arguments put forward by my noble friend Lady Faithfull and supporters of her Bill that progress in carrying out the reviews and amalgamations envisaged in the 1960 Act has been slow, especially in recent years. I should, however, remind the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, that reviews have been instituted in every county of England and Wales, and that in the 16 years until the end of 1980 1,242 schemes had been made by the Charity Commissioners as a direct result of local reviews.<lb/>
To those who believe that it is in the best interests of charity that small and out-dated charities should merge to be more effective in achieving their purposes and in relation to the area in which they can be applied, the results of this part of the 1960 Act must be disappointing. While it is the case that the majority of small charities have already had their purposes modernised by the commissioners where this was necessary, the number of grouping schemes has not been as great as expected.<lb/>
I think we have to examine the possible causes for this apparent lack of progress before we can give the Bill before us today proper consideration. As I said a moment ago, your Lordships' House itself originally considered the need for the consent of the trustees to a review to be essential. The experience of some local review organisers has shown that trustees of parochial charities guard their independence jealously, and they are often unwilling to see their benefits distributed over a wider area. Although this attitude is sometimes considered as intransigent and old-fashioned, it surely can also be seen as the proper respect for the donor's wishes, or the proper interpretation of those wishes with which the trustees have been entrusted. The reluctance of many trustees to participate in reviews only illustrates the point that most concerns the Government: that the imposition of a compulsory
<col>304</col>
element onto reviews of local charities is objectionable in principle.<lb/>
A further consideration was that expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, who echoed a point made in the annual report of the Charity Commissioners in 1980 and placed on it a very polite and subtle but nevertheless political gloss. The commissioners said:
<quote>"With local authorities under increasing pressure to reduce their expenditure, it is not surprising that few of them are willing to embark on reviews of charities operating within their area. This is in continuation of a trend which has been apparent for some years".</quote>
In consequence, the report continues, the two local review sections were disbanded and the work absorbed into the mainstream of the commissioners' work.<lb/>
While I understand and respect the reasons behind my noble friend's promotion of the Bill, I have to say that the Government see serious objections to it. It is fundamental to the law relating to charitable trusts that the property held on such trusts must be used for the purpose for which it was placed on trust. Any trust is protected in law, but charitable, trusts occupy a privileged position in that they are not subject to the rule against perpetual trusts, nor do they fail because their objects are uncertain or become impracticable. It seems right that we should take particular care to safeguard their original purposes as far as practicable. When the purpose of a charity is altered according to the <i>cy-pr&#x00E8;s</i> doctrine, the new object must remain within the spirit of the original donation and be varied to the minimum degree necessary to enable the charity to serve a useful purpose. This is a very different principle from that of the Bill before us, which overrides the wishes of the donors in a way which we believe is out of keeping with the principles and spirit of charity law.<lb/>
Charitable giving is, after all, essentially a personal and a voluntary activity. The Bill before us seems to have little sympathy with this. The thousands of local charities which would be affected by the Bill were established to help the poor in a wide variety of ways, reflecting personal interests and areas of concern. Much thought must have been given to the precise ways in which the donors wanted to benefit their localities, and it is worth remarking in passing that these charities are a fascinating record of how people in the past tried to help those in need. Certainly it is haphazard as a system, and it may not be the most rational way of using these resources.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate has suggested that this may be at the bottom of a perceived drift of charitable giving away from the very local and therefore very personal and welcome level. That is a point well taken, but there is another that we have to bear in mind. It is that charitable giving is already showing signs of decline. If people were not free to give as they pleased in the confidence that their wishes would be carrried out, it might well decline further still.<lb/>
I do not regard this (as the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, shakes his head) as a fanciful consideration. I think of the benefits left in the wills of people for local concerns. I would have thought that in drawing up their wills they would very much feel threatened by a sweeping and compulsory power operating on the field into which they wished to make a small and personal intervention, feeling that it might
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0161"/>
<col>305</col>
be absorbed into other purposes. Charity is voluntary giving, and charity law is based on the importance&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01074"><member>Lord Allen of A bbeydale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord. Will the Government express the same sentiments in dealing with the Bill that is currently in another place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01075"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when we come to see that Bill I shall address myself to that question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01076"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that the noble Lord the Minister cannot get away with that very short, sharp sentence. Are we to understand that, in spite of what he says, this other Bill which is in the other place is in fact favoured by the Government? If it is, there are many of us who will feel very angry, especially at that short reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01077"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what I am doing at present is addressing myself properly to discussing a Bill on the Order Paper of this House. The noble Lord wishes me to start to discuss a Bill on the Order Paper in another House. I very much doubt if I can properly at this stage introduce the discussion of another Bill. If I can do so, I shall return to the subject. In the meantime, I spare the noble Lord the pain of interrupting me further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01078"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord accepts the pain and is prepared to suffer it for the sake of justice and for the sake of clarity in this House. The noble Lord the Minister has just expressed the principle&#x2014;a very clear principle&#x2014;that it would deter people who might be wishing to make charitable gifts or, indeed, legacies in their wills, by the fact that their purpose may be frustrated. There is another Bill in another place which does frustrate that object by making it a fact that such trusts come to an end. Would the noble Lord the Minister say whether in his discursion into this matter he feels that that is consistent with what he has just said? If he feels that that object is inconsistent, may we take it for granted that the Government are consistent in their view and will oppose the other Bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01079"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the other Bill to which the noble Lord refers does not have an element of compulsion and we are in favour of the voluntary principle. The noble Lord will not expect me to announce the Government's proposed Second Reading speech on the other Bill before it reaches this House, which is what I thought he wished me to do. But if the noble Lord, asks me whether we are consistent in being opposed to compulsion, the answer is, Yes.<lb/>
Central and local government may have a variety of ideas about how resources can best be deployed and they have access to resources with which to give effect to such policies and priorities in rational and efficient ways. It is to be hoped that similar principles will apply to resources contributed voluntarily, but it is fundamental to existing charity law that no Government compulsion of any kind should be admissible to achieve that.<lb/>
We have received letters from a number of trustees of charities who would be affected by the Bill; most
<col>306</col>
have raised objections to it. They accept that some charities are not effective but many of the letters point out that their charities are performing useful tasks efficiently, and on one occasion they even produced accounts to prove it. The trustees are understandably anxious to preserve their independence and express resentment that they might be forced into amalgamations regardless of how much of a success had been made of each charity. Trustees of local charities have considerable duties to perform and many of them take great pride in performing them well&#x2014;a pride which is not directly related to how much money is at their disposal.<lb/>
Although the Bill aims for the effective use of charitable resources it could well have an opposite effect both in the loss of active, thriving local charities which would be caught by the Bill, and in the possible loss of many interested and experienced trustees.<lb/>
Nor is it the charity trustees alone who are to be subjected to the compulsory elements of the Bill: the local authorities also must carry out their reviews of the charities in their areas within one year of the Bill's passage and the Charity Commissioners must issue schemes giving effect to the recommendations arising from the review reports. We believe that most counties would not welcome the Bill on cost grounds, as they would simply be unable to carry out the provisions within their existing resources. I am as chary of my noble friend's optimistic assessment of the cost of those as I am of her estimate of the capital sums in question. We have already seen signs of a decline in charitable giving and we have already seen signs of unwillingness under the voluntary reviews so far carried out. The same is true of the Charity Commission: there is no way in which it could take on this work without extra staff and increased expense to the taxpayer. As my noble friend Lady Faithfull said, the commissioners have a difficult task and we are fortunate that they carry it out with such dedication and judgment.<lb/>
Even were the principles not objectionable there could be no question, at the moment, of the Government allowing additional resources for either local authorities or Charity Commissioners to carry out the tasks which would be imposed on them by the Bill. But this does not mean that we are not prepared to look at ways in which the resources available to local charities may be appropriately put to more effective use, where this is thought desirable.<lb/>
Like the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, we believe that we should know more about the difficulties which local charity reviews encounter, their possible benefits in persuading charity trustees to release resources for wider use, their cost-effectiveness, and the scope for establishing a neighbourhood trust or improving the use of local charitable funds by making information about their objects more widely available. As my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway has said, information is something which we still do not have enough of. To this end the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit is funding a local charity review in Lancashire. It has taken some time to get going but it has started work this month with the appointment of a review organiser. Progress in reviews like this is never as quick as one would like, but those concerned are very enthusiastic and I believe that it will give us a
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0162"/>
<col>307</col>
good opportunity to see how effective a review, which does not rely in any way on compulsion, can be in practice.<lb/>
I have explained at too great length why the Government consider that this Bill is out of step with charity law, and how those most closely affected by it could not welcome it, warts and all. For these reasons, the Government are unable to advise the House to support this measure, although I would not be so churlish as to advise it to reject it.<lb/>
Support for the idea of the Select Committee has been pretty general this afternoon, and I heard with particular interest the support given to it by the right reverend Prelate and, indeed, by the Churches' main committee. A Select Committee might be able to acquire a great deal of valuable knowledge and a welcome depth of wisdom on this subject. It might even enable the Bill to qualify to benefit from that charity to which my noble friend earlier referred whose founder suffered from warts on his nose, and get some of them off the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01080"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, I should like to ask a point of clarification. I must have misunderstood. What is the point of sending this Bill to a Select Committee if Her Majesty's Government are committed to the other Bill? Perhaps I have misunderstood the position?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01081"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I have said very nearly as much as I can on this subject. I have told your Lordships of a principle which we find objectionable in this Bill; your Lordships have asked whether it is in the other Bill, and I have said, No. But I think my noble friend should consult through the usual channels if he wants to take the matter further, because I cannot take it further.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01082"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether I might extend this point. I am sure that the House does not wish to waste its time or that of a Select Committee of your Lordships' House. The noble Lord the Minister expressed a point of view of principle and then said that he was now on another principle&#x2014;that of compulsion or voluntary act. I am assuming, as I believe others of your Lordships are assuming, that the origional settler or testator is now dead and therefore cannot be consulted, and therefore cannot be said to be doing something voluntarily. He has a succession of trustees and they of course could, under the other Bill, cause his charitable trust to cease and be frustrated. That is not, from the point of view of the original settler or testator, a voluntary act because he is in another place&#x2014;whether higher or lower&#x2014;where his consent cannot be given.<lb/>
Therefore, I am afraid that the question of compulsion or voluntariness does not apply to the principle that the noble Lord the Minister is trying to enunciate. I believe that this House would be extremely angry&#x2014;and I have used that word before&#x2014;if it were led to believe that the whole matter was being considered by a Select Committee when in fact another Bill was going to be given Government assistance in another place.</membercontribution></p>
<col>308</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01083"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure how long the conventions of this House allow us to play ping pong across the Table at Second Reading. On the question of compulsion not being exercisable upon a testator who had departed these realms to another place, the wishes of the testator nevertheless survive him in the hands of the trustees. It is the voluntariness of the actions of the trustees which we think should not be impinged upon. As I do not know the outcome of what is happening in another place at this stage, I still am not in a position to predict what will happen in this case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01084">1.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01085"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I should rise quickly because otherwise we might be here until tomorrow morning. What is perfectly clear is that,
<quote>"The time has come, the walrus said,</quote>
<quote>For something to be done".</quote>
All those who have spoken today agree that something has to be done, though many of us have been divided as to exactly what it should be. I shall not detain the House very long because there is further business. First of all, I thank every noble Lord who has spoken in the debate today. I know that the subject is a complicated one, and I am most grateful to all those who have spoken and contributed.<lb/>
Perhaps I may briefly make a few points. First, we&#x2014;and in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon&#x2014;have talked about the question of resources. The noble Lord, Lord Foot, very well answered the question. If any other Government department&#x2014;and we have learnt from my noble friend the Minister that this is regarded as a Government department&#x2014;was running on such short resources that it had to be inefficient, because that is what it means, I wonder whether that would be allowed. I suspect not.<lb/>
On the question of the mandatory and voluntary principle, it has been pointed out by many noble Lords that the voluntary principle for the formation of neighbourhood trusts has existed since 1960. This has been pointed out by many noble Lords, and it has not been effective. Another point is the question of data. I understand that there are data, because the reviews have been carried out throughout the country. This is in the hands of the Charity Commissioners. What I would suggest is that those data have not yet been properly analysed, but they are there.<lb/>
With regard to the Bill before the other place, I am going to be careful over this, because otherwise we could continue. I would support other noble Lords who have said that this is an extraordinary situation. I have on other Bills found myself in disagreement with my noble friend the Minister. I have the greatest admiration for his ability and, usually, for his logical approach to everything. In this, I have to say that it is not a logical approach to support the Bill before the other place and not to support the principles of the Bill before your Lordships' House today.<lb/>
Many noble Lords have talked about the composition of the Charity Commission and the way it works. Many noble Lords have said that it is an independent, <i>quasi</i>-legal body. I wonder whether my noble friend the Minister will forgive me if I say that
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0163"/>
<col>309</col>
his speech today bears that out. I would suggest that he is speaking to a brief, and obviously, with all that he has to do, he cannot possibly have the time really to know how the Charity Commission operates. This point was well brought out by the noble Lord, Lord Beloff, and the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone.<lb/>
I am grateful for what has been said. I must make my position clear over the Charities Bill before the other House. Should it come to this House I could not possibly support it. If your Lordships are going to grant a Second Reading, followed by the agreement to a Select Committee, I would suggest that the Bill before the other House should be considered by the Select Committee rather than us having yet another debate, though that is not for me to say. I thank your Lordships for your support, and I thank the noble Minister for what he has had to say, although I cannot fully agree with him.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Copyright (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01090">1.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01091"><member>Lord Willis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is just over a year ago since I last addressed your Lordships on the subject of copyright. On that occasion, I said, if your Lordships will allow me to quote:
<quote>"What is needed is the political will to bring the copyright laws into line with the present conditions. The present law has been out-distanced and out-dated by modern technology. It needs to be changed as a matter of urgency &#x2026; It is in the interests of all that our arts, and the industries which support them, should flourish &#x2026; they earn millions of pounds for the economy and do a great deal for the prestige of Britain abroad. But they would not have been able to do any of this without the copyright protection which at present exists&#x2014;and they will not be able to do so in the future unless that protection is brought up to date".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 31/3/82; col. 1439.]</quote>
In that year, my Lords, all the evidence goes to show that the situation has become worse&#x2014;far worse&#x2014;and that the introduction of still newer technology and the great increase in piracy has made the need for action even more urgent. The present Bill before your Lordships is a modest measure designed to plug one or two of the more obvious holes. It is essentially a minor first-aid job, which will, so to speak, help to staunch the flow of blood until more substantial remedies are available.<lb/>
The background to the Bill is the growing practice of private copying of records and films, what is known as home taping, and the question, yet again, of piracy. When I spoke a year ago, I regret to say that <i>Hansard,</i> usually the most reliable of chroniclers, got one word of my speech wrong. I do not blame them for that because it was a difficult word, but it was also a vital word. <i>Hansard</i> reported me as saying:
<quote>"You can now record, if one can make a new phrase, music from records or films and programmes from television in the privacy of your own home.&#x2014;[col. 1437]</quote>
<col>310</col>
What I actually said was that you could do all these things in the "piracy" of your own home. A subtle but vital difference.<lb/>
What was true then is doubly true today. The latest estimate from the music industry is that it is losing something like &#x00A3;300 million a year as a result of illegal copying. It cannot be too strongly stressed that when I speak of the music or the record industry I am speaking of a host of people who depend, directly or indirectly, on music, records and films for their livelihoods&#x2014;writers, composers, musicians, shopkeepers, printers, engineers and so forth. It is these people who are being robbed. For that is exactly what it is, my Lords; it is robbery.<lb/>
I must admit that I have my doubts about the use of the words "piracy" and "pirates". It has connotations of romance and glamour enshrined in Holywood films starring bold buccaneers like Erroll Flynn. Believe me, my Lords, the present pirates are nothing like that. I believe that we should call a spade a spade, and a thief a thief. But I very much regret that I think we are stuck with the word "pirates", and, if we are, then, my Lords, I tell you that Britain today is a great market for the thieves and pirates. Britain has today become Treasure Island for those who steal the copyright of other people.<lb/>
One new feature of the situation that is causing alarm to the record industry is the development of retail outlets which are devoted to the rental of gramophone records and cassette tapes. The retail cost of a record or a pre-recorded cassette can be between &#x00A3;4 and &#x00A3;5. The rental shops offer these out for a nightly hire charge of about 40p or 50p. There can be no doubt that the vast majority of people, quite innocently, hire these records and cassettes for 40p or 50p to record them in their own homes. They may record two or three copies for their friends. From their point of view it is good value for money. A blank tape costs &#x00A3;1 or less, and the hire charge added to that means that for about &#x00A3;1.50, about one-third of the retail price, the borrower can have the latest recording. It does not concern him or the rental shop that in doing this he is actually cheating, that he is as guilty of the theft of other people's property as if he were a shoplifter or a pickpocket.<lb/>
Let us think of it in this way, there are some 20 to 25 million sound cassette recorders in private hands in Britain. If, at a conservative estimate, only 50 per cent. of these are used illegally to record borrowed records, and if at an even more conservative estimate, this 50 per cent. copy only one record each year, that means a potential loss to the record industry of about 20 million sales a year. It might be argued that not all these people would go out to buy the record. I think it is very conservative to say that they would record only one a year, but, even so, if we were to slash the figure by half or three-quarters the loss is still absolutely staggering. I defy your Lordships to think of any other industry in this country which is subject to such undeserved losses. No other industry is being plundered and pillaged on a regular, recurring basis. I must stress again that when I am talking of "the industry" I mean writers, composers, musicians, artistes and everyone.<lb/>
I am not suggesting that we should appoint an army of investigators who would have the power to enter
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0164"/>
<col>311</col>
people's homes and check on what they get up to with their recorders. Heaven forbid&#x0021; It is my belief that the only long-term answer to illegal home-taping is to recognise that it exists and that it cannot be policed, and to impose a royalty on all blank tapes and recording machines. That would be a simple and effective method of licensing, and I hope that the Government will look at this possibility. But that is for the future; it has nothing to do with the present Bill. What we can do in the meantime is to make it just a little more difficult for the home-taper, particularly for those who use record rental shops for the purpose of copying.<lb/>
As yet, rental shops have not developed in Britain to the same extent as in other countries. But there are ominous signs. The record industry is alarmed about them. The threat is there, and it is my hope that in this instance the Government will act before the horse has bolted.<lb/>
Let me give your Lordships one example&#x2014;the experience of Japan. It will give your Lordships some idea of the immensity of the threat. In June 1980 the first rental store for records and pre-recorded cassettes opened in Japan. It was such a runaway success that in the space of nine months the number of rental shops in Japan had risen to 800. That was in nine months. One of the enterprising newspapers in Japan took a poll of the people using rental shops, and 98 per cent. of the people who hired records and the pre-recorded cassettes admitted that they did so to copy them at home. All this had a disastrous effect on the legitimate business in Japan. The sale of official records and prerecorded cassettes dropped, on average, 30 per cent., and in some cases in Tokyo it dropped 60 per cent. Imagine the outcry if any of our high street shops were subject to such losses as a result of illegal trading.<lb/>
The threat is there, and the first purpose of the Bill which I now present to your Lordships is to widen the scope of the law so that it covers record rental operations. It is necessary because the present law, the Copyright Act 1956, was framed before these new problems arose. The present Act gives the record industry little or no protection from unauthorised rental of its products. I do not want to burden the House with the legal technicalities. Suffice it to say that the industry brought a test case against an unauthorised record business in 1981, and it was found that the Act of 1956 could not give it the protection it needed. The present Bill, although it would not automatically condemn a record rental business, would give the record industry a fairer crack of the whip and enhance its ability to defend its products against theft.<lb/>
For example, in Clause 1, the new subsection (2A) would impose on the courts the obligation to apply an objective test to the circumstances of a rental business so that it could decide whether as a question of fact those circumstances were likely to lead to copyright infringement. If the answer is "Yes", then the proprietor is deemed to have authorised a copyright infringement and may be dealt with on that basis. This subsection removes once and for all the need to argue abstruse points of law on the subject of authorisation&#x2014;a problem that has dogged the record industry in its attempts to bring offenders to book. It makes the law more even-handed. It does not in any way attack the legitimate record business.<lb/>
<col>312</col>
The new subsection (2B) in Clause 1 is designed to get round an obvious ploy by the proprietors of rental businesses. For example, in the test case I have already mentioned the proprietor in fact displayed a notice in his shop pointing out that home-copying was an infringement of copyright. It seemed from the results that this notice had about as much effect on the public as the health warnings on cigarette packets. The home-copying went on. Nevertheless, this little ploy seemed to find some favour with the judge in the test case.<lb/>
The insertion of the new subsection (2B) would simply mean that the display of such a notice, cynically meant, could not be a defence in itself. It would be only one of the factors that the court would have to take into account. It could not ignore it, but it would not necessarily be justification for copyright infringement.<lb/>
I now come to the new subsection (2A)(<i>b</i>) in Clause 1, which deals with a different but equally serious aspect of the problem. This provision is aimed at those people who copy tapes and records for the purpose of re-selling them to the public&#x2014;a form of dubious enterprise which is widespread and growing. I have here, for example, a cassette that one could buy in a market, street or sometimes in a pub for about &#x00A3;2&#x2014;half the normal retail price of the genuine article. It is a piratical copy. It is a theft, a robbery; but thousands of these tapes have been sold. The fact is that they are not as good as the original because the pirates do not take that amount of care, but to the uneducated eye it looks a reasonable tape which is cheap. It may feature a favourite group, and the person thinks: "Fine; I will buy that because it is cheap". Hundreds, but hundreds of thousands, of these tapes are being sold this weekend in the marketplaces, in streets and in pubs. Each lost sale costs the record industry between &#x00A3;3 and &#x00A3;4&#x2014;and, again we are talking about composers, musicians, salesmen, shopkeepers and so on. All these people are being robbed.<lb/>
The record industry has been fighting these thieves for years with some success, but they are handicapped by the weakness of the law on copyright. Its fight is not helped when manufacturers bring on to the market machines which can only help the thieves and counterfeiters. For example, a Japanese company called AIWA intoduced a new machine last year and they issued with it a press statement. The press statement says and I quote:
<quote>"Tapes can now be copied at four times the speed of conventional tape decks"&#x2014;</quote>
I am talking about sound tapes&#x2014;
<quote>"with the introduction of AIWA's latest model &#x2026; this means that the entire contents of a 60-minute cassette can now be copied in an incredible 15 minutes".</quote>
My Lords. I have quoted only two sentences in that paragraph and in each one there is a reference to copying. Copying what, for Heaven's sake? What they are talking about is copying records and pre-recorded tape cassettes which have been made at some cost by the recognised music industry.<lb/>
This machine costs less than &#x00A3;200 and it is being offered for sale to the public. Your Lordships will know as well as I that the general public have no use for such a machine. Who wants a machine that can record a cassette in their home in 15 minutes? Who is going to pay &#x00A3;200 for that? It has a limited use,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0165"/>
<col>313</col>
perhaps, in education and in commerce; but, basically, the only people who are going to buy that machine are the pirates, the counterfeiters. And it may well be that because of its low price, it will attract yet more thieves into the business of robbing the record industry.<lb/>
The machine can copy four cassettes an hour. Used for only 12 hours a day, it could produce 400 tapes&#x2014;forged tapes&#x2014;in a week. Those counterfeit tapes will yield a profit of some &#x00A3;300 to &#x00A3;400 to the counterfeiter. It means that the small man can now enter the pirate industry as well as the mafia, the heavy-money boys who really are in the pirate video tape and cassette recording business in a very big way. There is heavy money in this. In one week therefore with one of these machines that you buy for &#x00A3;200, you produce 400 tapes and sell them on street corners or in pubs, you make a profit of&#x00A3;300, you pay for your tape-copying machine and you are already in pocket. That is a measure of the seriousness of the problem. So far, this machine is confined to sound copying; but there can be little doubt that, before very long, a machine capable of doing the same thing for films and video will appear. If this happens, there will be a new explosion of piracy and, as I said earlier, the expression "Treasure Island" will have a new meaning to this country.<lb/>
Section 2A(<i>b</i>) is designed to discourage manufacturers and distributors from offering machines with this capacity for sale to the public. I do not want to put a limit to new technology. I am not a Luddite. But where a machine appears to have no other function than to copy other people's products, some halt must be called. I am not seeking even to ban those machines. I am not seeking in the Bill to penalise the owner of an ordinary cassette recorder, no matter how sophisticated. This section simply puts the courts in a position to look objectively at any particular machine and to decide whether, by its nature, it is likely to be used to infringe copyright. The manufacturers and distributors will not be unfairly penalised. They will have full opportunity to defend their products in the courts.<lb/>
That in essence is the scope and purpose of this Bill. It is brief but, like everything else connected with copyright, it is a little complicated. I have done my best to explain the background of the Bill but, of necessity, there are points and arguments which I have been unable to deal with for reasons of time. I am delighted that Sir John Eden's Bill (which deals with some other aspects of the problem) has made progress in another place and will be here soon. I am even more delighted that it has received Government blessing. May I hope, because the industry is bleeding savagely from these wounds, that your Lordships and the Government will give my small Bill a similar fair wind. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01092">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Willis.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01093">2.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01094"><member>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House is indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Willis, for the way he brings this matter to our attention. We are all the richer for having noble Lords like him who specialise in particular matters and bring amending legislation before your Lordships' House at varying intervals. In
<col>314</col>
this particular case, there is no doubt whatsoever that the problem that he has brought before us is a very real one, that it causes distress, it causes financial loss and that it is something which, as a whole, the legislature should look at and should make up its mind on how it is going to cope with the whole problem of piracy.<lb/>
Having said that, I must now say that in my view and that of my colleagues on these Benches, this Bill just will not do and does not begin to be acceptable. There is a balance always between the protection of artistes and the good of the community; and the protection of artistes should be very high on our list of priorities. But it seems to us that this Bill would start with laying burdens on the courts with which they would be totally unable to cope and which, even if they did cope with them, would lead to injustices.<lb/>
Moreover, it seems to go further than that. I was about to use the word "Luddites" which the noble Lord, Lord Willis, himself disowned; but I hesitate to do so because I am not totally against Luddism on the right occasions. I suspect that the approach to modern technology and, in this case, the approach to the machines in this kind of way, are rather like the courtiers who would have King Canute attempt to stem the tide. King Canute, of course, was far too wily an old bird to fall for that one. He knew perfectly well that he could not. The noble Lord, Lord Willis, said that these machines now being used for sound tapes are merely the precursors of those to be used for video tapes. I have no doubt that that is so. I think we could probably say that the machines which now record accurately and well at four times the speed of the original tapes will probably be overtaken in time by ones which can do so at 10 times the speed&#x2014;or even better.<lb/>
It does not seem to me that the way to deal with this is effectively to ban the sale of these machines or to ban the businesses which deal with them. The noble Lord, Lord Willis, said it was not his intention to ban the machines; but I really cannot see how else the Bill would work. The courts would have the difficult job of deciding whether the businesses which were up before them were <i>bona fide</i> rental businesses or supplied <i>bona fide</i> machines for <i>bona fide</i> use in other cases. It is very difficult to see on what evidence they could come to conclusions. Of course, some cases would be clear and others would be very unclear. I would have thought there was, frankly, the possibility of self-respecting judges and self-respecting courts going on strike. The difficulties for the law would be too great.<lb/>
It is for these basic reasons that we from these Benches cannot support this Bill. However, there are methods of dealing with the problem and my Party has adopted a policy which goes along with the taxation of blank tapes and also with recorded tapes&#x2014;because a point that has been made by one of the bodies which have approached Members of your Lordships' House on this matter is that if the blank tape is taxed the recorded tape should also be taxed since a recording could be taken off and the tape re-used. A basic tax seems to be the right approach to this.<lb/>
This afternoon is not the time to argue the rights and wrongs of that, except to say that as a basic principle it is probably right, as often as one can, to bridge the gap that exists in many cases between, on the one hand, complete licence and, on the other hand,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0166"/>
<col>315</col>
complete banning, which is what I believe this Bill would lead to, by some form of progressive taxation. That is the approach that we take, for instance, in the matter of cigarettes, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Willis. I think it is the way to approach a number of other subjects. I merely mention the alternatives because it is right that those who object to this Bill should say how they would deal with the evil. There are methods of dealing with it, I think; but this Bill is unacceptable.<lb/>
I hope that there is not going to be a vote on it. I think that the growing habit of voting against Second Readings of Private Bills is a great pity. It may be that this Bill is capable of amendment, although at the moment I think there is some doubt. But I am afraid we cannot accept this Bill as it is and certainly we would not be in favour of its further progress through your Lordships' House in its present state. However, we admire and are grateful for the thought and the motives behind it which have prompted the noble Lord, Lord Willis, to bring it before your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01096"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I join with the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, in his congratulations to my noble friend for introducing this Bill. I rather suspect that my congratulations are somewhat more wholehearted than his were because, having congratulated my friend on introducing the Bill, he then went on to say that he could not support it.<lb/>
It is sometimes worthwhile to introduce a Bill for the sake of discussion, but I very much hope that my noble friend has done no such thing here this afternoon because, although I go along to a certain extent with the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, in thinking that the Bill at present is far from perfect&#x2014;I think that my noble friend may agree with me on that point and I have myself reservations over some parts of it&#x2014;nevertheless it does attempt seriously to tackle for the first time a problem, attention to which is long overdue.<lb/>
My interest in this matter stems from the fact that for many years I worked full-time for Equity, the actors' trade union, and I still have a great interest in the welfare of performers. This is one case which ought to commend itself to both sides of the House, and I say that for this reason. In this matter there is no division whatsoever between the employers and the employees. The trade unions concerned fully recognise that, in the present situation, they may be inhibited from getting a square deal from the makers of the records.<lb/>
Let me try to translate this situation and consider it in relation to the motor-car industry. If a manufacturer of motor-cars made a few of them and then somebody copied them without charge and sold more than the original manufacturer, how then could a trade union negotiate a reasonable remuneration with the manufacturer of the original motor-cars if it was not retaining the profits on all the cars which were made? This is the position that has arisen. The original manufacturer of the article is not only losing his own profit but is unable to give a proper remuneration to the people who make the records. There is not the slightest difference here.<lb/>
<col>316</col>
What is happening, without putting too fine a point on it, is that the community is exploiting the producer. This must be stopped, because it is possible&#x2014;although the National Consumer Council does not appear to think so&#x2014;for the consumer to be against the community as a whole. It is in the interests of the community that the person who makes an object shall receive a fair reward. If that proposition is accepted, and if the consumer is getting round that by getting a product without paying for it, then it is the consumer who is at fault. It is the duty of Government not only to protect the interests of the consumer, but, from time to time, to protect the interests of the producer, both employer or employee. As I said, the interests of the employer and the employee go together.<lb/>
This is not a case where, in their nightmares, noble Lords sometimes see employer and employee getting together to exploit the rest of the community. On the contrary, as I have said, this is a case of the community exploiting the producer. We are surely all agreed that we need to protect the producer and to give him a reasonable reward for his endeavours, whether that reward comes in terms of profits or in terms of salary, wages or other remuneration.<lb/>
I said that I am not entirely happy with the Bill as it stands, but I am entirely happy with Clause 1(2A)(<i>a</i>). It seems to me that this goes to the heart of the matter, because it states that an offence occurs at the point at which the product is sold. That is quite easy to define. What this means&#x2014;and this needs to be done&#x2014;is that, if I make a film or a record for my own use, that is no longer a technical offence as it is at the moment. It becomes possible to do that without breaking the law. Under this Bill an offence will occur when I take that record to a market place and try to sell it&#x2014;or not merely one, but dozens or hundreds. That is definable and is no problem in law.<lb/>
With paragraph (<i>b</i>) we run into problems. It will not be so easy for a court of law to define an offence there. So I hope that my noble friend will say that, in return for getting a Second Reading this afternoon, he will be very ready to accept improvements at the Committee stage; or the Bill might conceivably go to a Select Committee, as the previous one did. But certainly the Bill ought not to be withdrawn. We ought to be making some progress on this matter, and one way of doing that would be to give this Bill a Second Reading, in the hope that some improvements can be made to it so that the main purposes of the Bill, which are long overdue, would come into effect.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have received an advocacy of the Bill from the British phonographic industry. That advocacy seems to me to be convincing, with the qualification that I have made. We have also received objections to the Bill from the tape manufacturers group. They object to subsection (2A)(<i>b</i>) rather than to subsection (2A)(<i>a</i>). I understand their objection to that paragraph. I believe there is much to be said for placing a levy on the machine itself and for that levy going back to the manufacturer. Even if the product is made only for home use it is an additional use of the product, and the manufacturer is entitled to some remuneration for it. The levy on the machine would be collected and would go to the manufacturer. I hope that it would go not only to the manufacturer of the film or record but also eventually&#x2014;by way of royalty
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0167"/>
<col>317</col>
or something of that kind&#x2014;to the performer on the record: the singer, or the musician, or the writer. My noble friend will not mind, I am sure, if I include writers. Have we no consideration for the creative and the interpretive artist? They are the people who make such recordings possible; without them, nothing would happen and they must be protected.<lb/>
I believe I have said enough to indicate that the observations of the National Consumer Council are not in this case correct. I agree with some of their remarks, but a great deal of what they say is irrelevant to this small Bill. It may, however, have some relevance to further changes which the Government intend to introduce.<lb/>
I hope I have said enough to make it clear that I trust the House will give a Second Reading to my noble friend's Bill and that it will proceed. Like so many other things, it may conceivably fall because of electoral events which overtake us. But many other things, including those which might be even more important than this, will fall if there should be a general election. However, that would be no excuse at all for not giving the Bill a Second Reading this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01097">2.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01098"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the battle against thieves, robbers, pirates and the mafia&#x2014;phrases which have been rightly used by my noble friend&#x2014;this House will be united. I cannot imagine any noble Lord deciding to take the part of anyone who deserved that description. There is no doubt that not only is there a threat but that thieving, robbing, pirating and mafia activities are going on in an industry which is vital to this country, and which your Lordships would wish to encourage: that of the creation and practice of art, whatever form it might take. Therefore I join those noble Lords who have already spoken in expressing gratitude to my noble friend Lord Willis for bringing this very important matter to your Lordships' attention.<lb/>
Having said that, I wonder whether your Lordships would permit me to say that it is a great pity that in our legislature we cannot keep up with the times. The fact of the matter is that by virtue of all the technological changes which have taken place, especially in the industry which we are discussing this afternoon, the Copyright Act 1956 is grossly out of date. As a result, many quite innocent people in this country in the privacy of their homes, without any ulterior or commercial motive, are likely to be infringing at this very moment the copyright law. I shall give a brief example. The mere copying, on an ordinary, a slow-moving machine of a record at home, without any desire to sell it at all, constitutes a breach of copyright. This means that with the technological advances we have had, it is vital that the whole law of copyright be given a very definite examination, in order to bring it up to date.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Willis has said that this is a very urgent matter. There is no doubt that he is right. Therefore I cannot, on behalf of my noble friends, be content to say that we should look at the whole question of the law on copyright and wait for that consideration before we do anything about it. I
<col>318</col>
immediately concur with those who say that this Bill should undoubtedly be given a Second Reading.<lb/>
Having said that&#x2014;and I promise to be very brief&#x2014;may I tell the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, that there are certain categories of people in this country who do not go on strike, and that judges are one of them. The noble Lord can therefore rest assured that whatever legal problem we may set them, the one reaction we shall have may be a criticism of Parliament but will certainly not be a walkout or a work-to-rule.<lb/>
There is no doubt at all that there are legal problems connected with the matter we are now considering. They are undoubtedly problems which can be considered at later stages of this Bill, and I am sure that my noble friend, with his usual reasonableness, will give consideration to any point that is raised on the various clauses of this short Bill.<lb/>
Perhaps your Lordships will bear with me if I spend a few moments telling the House of the case to which my noble friend briefly referred and which has given rise to the difficulties and problems which caused this Bill to come before us. It is not a very complicated case. It was the case of <i>CBS Inc. and Another</i> v. <i>Ames Records and Tapes Limited,</i> which was reported in the 1981 <i>All England Law Reports</i> at page 812. The noble Lord the Minister, with his usual attention to detail, waves before us a copy of that actual law report; but I trust that when he comes to address us after half past two this afternoon, it will not be his intention to read that report <i>in extenso.</i><lb/>
This case concerned a man who owned a record shop in the North of England. He started a rental scheme for records and also sold blank tapes. As my noble friend intimated, a rental charge is usually a very small amount, and people were encouraged&#x2014;or so it was thought&#x2014;to acquire both sets of this trader's wares&#x2014;to rent the records and buy the blank tapes. The result, obviously, was a nice recording on tape at home, achieved as a result of the rental transaction.<lb/>
Mr. Ames also had&#x2014;and I use my words discreetly&#x2014;a notice which brought to the attention of those who did business with him the fact that it constituted a beach of copyright if one copied material at home. That case was brought to court. The court was in some difficulty because there was no direct connection between the transactions I have just described and the actual infringement of the copyright, in the sense that the gentleman who rented out these records and sold blank tapes did not directly know&#x2014;because he was not a visitor to the homes in question&#x2014;that this was being done. Therefore, although it was very likely that the result of this transaction was the piracy to which my noble friend has referred, nevertheless he could not be proved to have knowledge of the breach of copyright. So my friend's Bill aims to put this right.<lb/>
Your Lordships will see the relevance of the facts of this case to one clause, for example, in this Bill, and that is subsection (2B) of Clause 1:
<quote>"Use of a disclaimer notice shall not of itself prevent conduct from falling within subsection (2A) of this section."</quote>
That is a very interesting section to read in view of the facts of this case.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0168"/>
<col>319</col>
Your Lordships, and I hope my noble friend, will think very deeply before we, in saving one industry or trying to protect it, harm another industry. There is no doubt about it, there is a perfectly innocent industry which we would want to encourage: that of making and selling recording machines. If one looks at what happens under the provisions of this Bill to somebody who dares to sell this type of machine in a retail shop, one would come to the conclusion that he would be a reckless man even to start stocking it, because if you look at subsection (2C) it says:
<quote>"Conduct may fall within subsections (2A)(<i>b</i>) of this section notwithstanding that the person supplying the machine had no knowledge of the use to which the machine was to be put and no control, whether direct or otherwise, over the first or subsequent purchasers of the machine."</quote>
Again, from the facts I ventured to outline to your Lordships one can see why this clause was put in; it was because of the previous judgment in the 1981 case. But, if I may say so, I think my noble friend will find that lawyers will tremble somewhat at the absolute nature of these clauses, to which my noble friend Lord Jenkins of Putney also referred. These matters can be dealt with without any doubt in Committee and at Report stage, and I have no doubt my noble friend will be able to agree to some of the amendments that lawyers may put forward without in any way spoiling the principle of the Bill.<lb/>
My Lords, it is in those circumstances that I hope that this Bill will certainly have a Second Reading in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01100"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have listened with fascination to the points that have been raised this afternoon, and I am sure your Lordships will join with me in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Willis, for introducing his Bill in such cogent terms, so briefly and in very amusing terms; indeed, it gave us the opportunity to listen to the wit of the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, about whom I shall have a little to say later in the course of my remarks. I promise I shall be brief. I hope I shall be forgiven if I address myself first to the Bill.<lb/>
The House will agree that the Copyright (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill raises some very interesting and important questions, but at the same time your Lordships will not be surprised to know that the Government have some serious reservations about the provisions contained in it. The Bill is essentially concerned with the issue of unauthorised home-taping, of both sound recordings and films, and this includes video films. This is one of the most important and difficult areas of copyright that the Government are currently examining as part of our general review which follows the publication in 1981 of a Green Paper. We hope that before too long we shall be able to bring forward a comprehensive set of proposals for the reform and modernisation of all aspects of copyright law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01101"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01102"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord gives sound approbation and encouragement, but I assure you and
<col>320</col>
the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that this is a particularly complicated subject. Indeed, the subject we have been discussing this afternoon is equally difficult.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have noted that the Bill has two distinct limbs. The first is in Clause 1 under the proposed new Section 1(2A)(<i>a</i>) of the Copyright Act 1956. This concerns rental and similar transactions involving copyright records and films. Under this provision anyone who, without the consent of the copyright owner, engaged for profit in the business of rental, lease, exchange or the like of copyright sound recordings or films&#x2014;here we come to some difficult points&#x2014;in circumstances likely to lead to their unauthorised copying would be deemed to have authorised an infringement of copyright, and hence to have himself committed an infringement.<lb/>
I am sure that all of your Lordships will agree that one of the most striking features of the sudden and surprising growth of the video market in this country has been the predominance of rental. This was raised very forcibly by the noble Lord, Lord Willis. It has been estimated (although I cannot vouch for the precise figures) that about 1&#x00BC; million video cassettes are rented each week in the United Kingdom. This rental is such a recent phenomenon that it has not yet been possible to assess its full implication for those whose interests are at stake. We have heard that there are many more interests than just the mere simple transaction between the renter and the first customer.<lb/>
In particular, at the time when the copyright Green Paper was published in 1981 video rental had not been raised as an issue and consequently it did not receive any mention in that document. The publicity that this Bill will receive may be the first intimation to many of us, or to the public at large, that video rental has any implications for anyone other than those directly involved in a particular rental transaction&#x2014;the video shopkeeper and his customer. For this reason the Government are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Willis, for bringing this issue to the attention of your Lordships and to the wider public at this stage. However, having said that I must go on to express the reservations that we have about the rental side of the Bill. Indeed, these are serious reservations.<lb/>
There are three main reservations. The first is the Bill's provisions that the copyright owner would only be given a right in relation to rental,
<quote>"In circumstances likely to lead to the unauthorised making of any record embodying the recording or any copy of the film".</quote>
That appears to be reasonable but it also seems to be a recipe for confusion and misunderstanding. It would put an impossible burden on the rental operator if he had to decide in each case whether the circumstances were such that illegal copying was likely to result. The second reservation is about the phrase,
<quote>"rental, lease, exchange or the like".</quote>
This would be a fertile source of uncertainty. In particular, we are not clear what sort of behaviour would be caught by the words "or the like".<lb/>
The third main criticism of the Bill's rental provisions is on the question of timing. I did touch on this. The Government welcome the opportunity that the Bill presents for an examination of the issues involved in video, and indeed record, rental. We recognise that this is an idea that merits the closest
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0169"/>
<col>321</col>
scrutiny, especially in view of the way that video rental has developed. But, at the same time, we consider that it would be premature to prejudge these issues by introducing legislation in this way and just now. The real need for a rental right has not yet been demonstrated&#x2014;not for video and still less for records, since there seems to be very little commercial record rental activity in this country. The noble Lord, Lord Willis, mentioned Japan, but we stand by what we believe to be the case in this country. It has yet to be established, for example, that videogram producers cannot adequately protect their interests in relation to rental or exchange by contractual means.<lb/>
Instead, I hope that bodies representing all groups affected&#x2014;film and record producers and distributors, retail, rental and exchange operators, as well as their customers&#x2014;will take this opportunity of the matter being raised this afternoon to let the Department of Trade know their views on the subject. We would hope that they will get in touch with the Industrial Property and Copyright Department. I give the full commercial address, which is 25 Southampton Buildings, London, WC2A 1 AY. In case your Lordships did not gather that, I am sure that it will be in the <i>Official Report.</i> That may also help members of the public who might be interested. We assure your Lordships that the department will then be able to give the fullest and most balanced consideration to all the issues that are raised in the Bill, and will be able to decide whether to bring forward proposals for a rental or exchange right, at the same time as the general reform of copyright is announced.<lb/>
I turn now to the second main limb of the Bill, which is dealt with in Clause 1 under the proposed new Section 1(2A)(<i>b</i>) of the Copyright Act 1956. That is on the first page of the Bill, in line 18. Anyone who for the purposes of trade sold, distributed or otherwise made available any machine capable of reproducing a record or film, where the nature of the machine was such that the primary or a substantial use of it was likely to result in unauthorised copying of a copyright record or film, would, under this provision, he deemed to have authorised infringement of that copyright and so to have infringed it himself.<lb/>
Proposed new Section 1(2C) (over the page in the Bill at line 6 on page 2) states that this would be so even though the person supplying the machine had no knowledge of the use to which it was to be put and, above all, no control whatsoever over the first or subsequent purchasers of it. Just here I would mention that under the proposed new Section 1(2B) at the top of the page, the tape rental or equipment retail operator would not be saved from proceedings for his, so to speak, "contributory infringement" by the display of a disclaimer notice, as we popularly call it, warning his customers against unauthorised copying.<lb/>
This provision is full of problems both of interpretation and of principle. The equipment it covers is by no means clear. With the increase in technological advance and these new wonder implements that were mentioned&#x2014;I hardly dare say advertised&#x2014;by the noble Lord, Lord Willis, it becomes even less clear. The provision apparently covers not only the recently emerged high speed, tape-to-tape audio recorders, but also all domestic music centres, as they are popularly known, and combined
<col>322</col>
radio/cassette recorders. Indeed, it may even extend to simple tape recorders, both audio and video.<lb/>
Whether an item is covered depends, as always in legal matters, on the circumstances. I have mentioned a number of items of equipment, and I hasten to add that we are not in the Tottenham Court Road, or in an audio and video equipment bazaar. All these items which have been brought to my notice, even the high speed recorders, have legitimate uses which simply do not involve the infringement of copyright. Many such items are purchased by people who have no intention of ever using them for infringing purposes. That is undoubtedly true of very many music centres and combined cassette/radios. It would be quite wrong to put every distributor and retailer of all such equipment at risk of finding himself to be an infringer of copyright.<lb/>
However, the Bill would make such a person an infringer of a particular copyright only in circumstances in which the owner of copyright in a particular record or film could show that the sale or otherwise of the equipment was likely to result in unauthorised copying of that particular record or film. This provision would be very difficult for a copyright owner to apply, and it is very hard to conceive of circumstances that would with any certainty enable him to seek redress.<lb/>
We must ask ourselves whether the sale of equipment alone would in practice ever entitle him to relief. It is difficult to see how it could, given that a particular copyright must be threatened, and yet new subsection (2C) states that the equipment vendor may not be saved by his own ignorance of the use to which the machine is to be put. If not irreconcilable, these two concepts taken together could be difficult to apply&#x2014;and that is putting it fairly mildly. We should also consider whether the supplier is to be required to make inquiries about the proposed use of the equipment by his customer, or, for that matter, by anyone else.<lb/>
Perhaps the circumstances to which this part of the Bill may apply are very unlikely to arise. Let us suppose that a video shop that rents out videograms to its customers at the same time both sells blank video tapes and makes available in the shop video recording machines on which customers are encouraged to make copies of their newly-rented tapes. Perhaps the proprietor makes a charge for the use of the machine in this way. Such behaviour on the part of the proprietor would, I suppose, be within the Bill, and would, furthermore, be objectionable, since clearly he would be encouraging the infringement of copyright. However, one might expect the court to regard such provocative behaviour as amounting to the authorisation of infringement, and it would be caught even under present law. So the Bill seems to fill no existing loophole even on this extremely narrow interpretation.<lb/>
I wish briefly to turn to the very interesting comments that have been made by your Lordships in the course of the debate on the Bill this afternoon. During his very amusing remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Willis, raised the question of pirates, and this was alluded to even more succinctly by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. The noble Lord raised the matter in a very romantic way, but we accept that there is here a very serious problem, and that is why we hope that he
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0170"/>
<col>323</col>
and anyone who has a commercial or other interest in the matter will get in touch with us at the department.<lb/>
I was very interested in the noble Lords's "commercial" (if I may so describe it) for the high-speed recorder. He probably got the name right. I am not a great speaker of Japanese, though there are Members of your Lordships' House who have great facility in that language, and no doubt they could help the noble Lord. He also pointed out the advance of technology; and these new high-speed tape recorders will probably be obsolete by next year.<lb/>
There was much mention of art from technology. I wonder how far technology can be extended to taping and to what degree it can be taken into the privacy of our own homes. The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, mentioned that there would be many of us who might be taping at normal speed&#x2014;not at four times normal speed&#x2014;from a record onto a tape. I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, that he, and no doubt other Members of your Lordships' House, have technological knowledge which is certainly not possessed by some of us and certainly not by me, for a start. I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Willis, would consider that buying blank tapes and a video recording machine covers home taping of even his beloved football team. When it comes to art and artists, would it cover the said Mr. Hoddle who distinguishes himself in the noble Lord's beloved team? Is that covered under a copyright? Or is it an infringement? I promise that the comments made by the noble Lord and the points raised during discussion on the Bill will be taken into account.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, made some typically trenchant comments. However, as this is not a Government Bill I shall allow the noble Lord, Lord Willis, to field those trenchant comments from the Liberal benches. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, had some interesting thoughts on the copying of cars. Many non-technical Members of your Lordships' House may feel that one already needs a technical eye to understand overhead camshafts, twin valves or what seem to many of us to be heaps of metal with various accoutrements that seem to convey us from our homes to your Lordships' House and back. It seems to many of us that the copying of cars already goes on. We note the trenchant comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, about artists and how they could do with protection.<lb/>
When we come to legal matters and, above all, the matters we are discussing, the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, brings the art of wit and no little amusement to our debate. The noble Lord mentioned that technology had overtaken the Copyright Act 1956. This is also the view of the department. All judges at all levels will be glad of the noble Lord's support that they never work to rule or delay their judgments especially in home taping cases. The noble Lord mentioned a case. He should know that, like all good Scouts, Members of your Lordships' House and, above all, Government spokesmen, try to be well prepared.<lb/>
I did, with no little difficulty, find the interesting case that was mentioned both by the noble Lord, Lord Willis, and by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon. The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, referred to it as a simple case. I should like, with your Lordships' forbearance,
<col>324</col>
to mention that in <i>Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark Cases</i> No. 25 in 1981, we start at page 407. The case of <i>CBS Inc. and Another</i> versus <i>Ames Records and Tapes Limited,</i> dated 8th October 1981, took place in the Chancery Division before Mr. Justice Whitford. Your Lordships will be interested to know that the judgment of Mr. Justice Whitford carried on to page 428. These are pages of 45 lines or more. We therefore take the noble Lord's comment that this is a simple case with a pinch of salt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01103"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord not agree that some judges, like some noble Ministers, have very long briefs and very long judgments, and that sometimes it is usual, especially at this hour, to abbreviate them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01104"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take closely to heart the judgment of the noble Lord. Lord Mishcon. I would however draw to his attention and to that of your Lordships that this case covers fascinating observations on the making of trap orders. Furthermore Mr. Justice Whitford took a close look at a publication known as <i>Music Week.</i> Apart from working hard, judges seem to do all kinds of things. Later on that page Mr. Justice Whitford took a close look and quoted extensively from <i>Billboard</i> magazine, which goes to show that clearly such matters of technology and art penetrate even into the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. But we took a great deal of encouragement from the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, when he said that this was a simple case. We take his word for it, and, indeed. I am sure that my noble and learned friend will be grateful for his support for the legal profession in this and, indeed, in many other areas.<lb/>
I would conclude our discussion and comments on the Second Reading of the Bill before us this afternoon by making the general observation that the Government do not see the piecemeal approach to copyright reform embodied in this Bill as the correct way to modernise our law. We believe that it can lead to distortions and anomalies by dealing with different but inter related sections of the subject in different ways. As your Lordships will be aware, copyright is a complex subject with many facets, but those facets are closely interlinked and need to be considered together if unforeseen inconsistencies are to be avoided.<lb/>
The Government are in general opposed to the piecemeal approach to copyright reform, but it is a mark both of our constructive attitude and, indeed, of the extreme urgency that has recently arisen in the field of video piracy that we have been prepared to support two immediate measures to counteract it&#x2014;one which became law last Session and one which will shortly be considered by your Lordships' House having completed its passage in another place. While we do not deny that the home-taping question is pressing, it simply cannot be solved in the ways proposed in the Bill before us this afternoon. We hope that your Lordships will agree that it must await the completion of the Government's review. I have stressed&#x2014;and I stress it again&#x2014;that the outcome of this review will emerge as soon as possible.<lb/>
I may have expressed some strong criticisms of the Bill, but at the same time I welcome the opportunity that it presents for a consideration of the question of
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0171"/>
<col>325</col>
rental. We really do not want to hinder debate in your Lordships' House on this important subject, and, therefore, we would certainly give the Bill a fair wind this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01105">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01106"><member>Lord Willis</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken today. I must say that this afternoon I felt that I had one of my greatest triumphs when the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, said that there were certain clauses in this Bill that would make lawyers tremble. It has long been my ambition to make lawyers tremble, and if this Bill goes a small way towards achieving that lifetime's ambition then I shall be delighted.<lb/>
I should like to thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. There is one phrase that I have learned to dread over many years and that is, "Having said that &#x2026;". I remember that when I took my first script into the producer he said how fantastic and brilliant it was, and then of course, he went on to say, "Having said that &#x2026;". I had the same feeling when listening to the debate this afternoon.<lb/>
I do not think it would have been necessary for me to bring this Bill forward at all&#x2014;and I do not want to be unkind to the noble Lord the Minister&#x2014;if the Government had hurried a little more with what they have called their thorough overall review of copyright. Your Lordships will recall that last year I said that it had been seven years since the report had been issued and the Government had said that they would let us have a public debate on it. It is now eight years that that public debate has been raging, and that is why this piecemeal legislation is coming forward.<lb/>
There are one or two other points which I shall not bother to go into with your Lordships, but as regards the question of video rental we are rather running on one leg because at the moment people do not rent videos to copy; they rent them to view. To hire a television film on a video tape and then take it home and copy it on to another tape is a very expensive process. At the moment you cannot buy the machines for that readily in the market. So that is not really an issue at present, and neither are one or two of the other points that were raised. I am very cognisant of the fact
<col>326</col>
that I have kept your Lordships away from your country retreats quite long enough. Therefore, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01115"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01116">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01117">To ask the Chairman of Committees whether he is satisfied with the working of the new telephone message centre in the Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01118"><member>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Aberdare)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the new arrangements for telephone messages have been in operation for only four weeks. I understand that there have been some initial teething troubles but that these are being overcome. If, however, the noble Earl has a specific complaint in mind, I shall of course have it followed up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01119"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. May I ask him whether he is aware that I have put two of my complaints to Black Rod? On one day, the author of the message sent to me was a name utterly unrecognisable although it was carefully and painstakingly dictated by my secretary, who was very familiar with the name. On another occasion, the critical opening sentence of the message was omitted; and, on a third occasion, the message was not delivered at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01120"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am extremely sorry. I am afraid that these accidents and troubles do happen. They happened under the old system. I am not sure that it has anything to do with the new arrangements; but I am sure that if it has been brought to the attention of Black Rod he will have paid due attention to what the noble Earl says.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01121"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend the Chairman of Committees aware that there is no dialling code book in the telephone room?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01127"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps no one wants to ring me up, but I have never had anything but a decent and helpful service from the telephone staff. That should be recorded as well as any complaints that are made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01128"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble Earl. What he says is helpful. I know that the new telecommunications manager is extremely anxious to give the best possible service to the House. I am grateful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01129"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware, following upon what the noble Earl has stated&#x2014;with which I agree&#x2014;that I have always received excellent service and I have never had any cause for complaint?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01130"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am even more grateful to have support from the other side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01131"><member>Lord De Freyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord agree that there must be something wrong in the system? I was definitely sent three messages last week but did not receive any of them in any shape or form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01132"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be grateful if the noble Lord would give me details. I shall have the matter looked into.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01133"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord agree with what I think must be the general feeling of the House that we are grateful for having had an excellent telephone message service for many years, that we all understand that when a new system is introduced there are bound to be teething problems, but that there has been a sharp and measurable drop in efficiency since the new form of service was introduced?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01134"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can only think that this is probably the inevitable consequence of changing the system. I hope that these problems will be overcome shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01135"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that I received a telephone message a few minutes ago saying that there would be a general election on 9th June?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01136"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that just goes to show the efficiency of the service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01137"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that my question was not prompted by any criticism of the personnel in the House but rather the contrary? I was trying to suggest that something has gone wrong somewhere, possibly in another part of the building.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01138"><member>Lord Aberdare</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there has not really been much change. The same telephone operators who were formerly located here are now located elsewhere but they are the same people who dealt with us before. However, there are troubles, and I take the noble Earl's point. We shall endeavour to make sure that the service is improved.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01142">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make a statement on the future of the coastguard rescue service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01143"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have no plans to change the present responsibilities of Her Majesty's Coastguard for the co-ordination of civil maritime search and rescue. The modernisation of the service with improved communications and operational facilities is continuing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01144"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in thanking the noble Lord for that reply, may I ask when we can expect to have the Government's view on the Rayner Report, which includes the need to modernise our coastal radio stations? Will he say what will be the effect&#x2014;we hope it will be beneficial&#x2014;on the voluntary lifeboat system if some of its recommendations are accepted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01145"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we shall, of course, be able to consider the Rayner Report, which, as the noble Lord is aware, is under consideration by the Government. We expect to be able to announce a decision on it in due course. Your Lordships will be aware that the Royal National Lifeboat Institution is a proud and independent service, which we all admire. It is, however, entirely independent of the Government, and independent even of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01146"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord not agree that, although it may strictly be independent, the volunteers who give such magnificent service in the life-boat system believe that the nation should at least subscribe to testing and examining boats which are used to rescue other people and which sometimes fail and cost the lives of those volunteers? Will the noble Lord not agree that everything should be done to prevent such disasters as those that occurred in the Mumbles in 1947 and as recently as last year in Devonshire, if this is possible by providing better life-boats?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01147"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord may be perfectly correct, but I am afraid that all the points that he has raised have nothing to do with the Question on the Order Paper; and nor do they necessarily have anything to do with the coastguard service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01148"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with great respect, it has always been acknowledged right round the coast that there is an inextricable link between the voluntary lifeboat service, the radio stations and everything else connected with this matter. Therefore, are the Government not prepared to consider that there is a link which they could acknowledge and which they could help wherever possible?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01161"><member>The Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord ask the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, whether his fear that the population of this country might need to be evacuated could be averted if the Soviet Union were offered bases for their nuclear weapons in this country as well as the American's and our own?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01162"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in terms of the original Answer which I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, the whole idea of evacuation of this country falls.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01163"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that it might be helpful if the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, would tell us where the statement that he quoted was publicised?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01164"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be very interested to hear where it came from.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01165"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord not agree that the important practical point is that the talks now going on at Geneva should be successful and should be brought to a constructive conclusion? Can he say whether the Andropov proposals are on the agenda of the Geneva talks and what progress is being made at those talks?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01166"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect to the noble Lord, that is a totally different question from the Question on the Order Paper, which dealt with quotations, or supposedly quotations, from General Altenburg. The whole question of the talks at Geneva and the inclusion of the British deterrent in them is a different matter altogether. The British deterrent is a strategic deterrent of last resort. We do not possess it in order to offer protection to our friends. It is for us and for our own purposes and whether or not it is included is something which has been answered on many occasions in your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01167"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with great respect, the noble Lord himself commented on the nature and possible length of a nuclear war. These are matters which are now being discussed between the USSR and the United States of America at Geneva and they are vital to the talks that are taking place. Is the noble Lord aware that his noble friend Lord Belstead has said on many occasions at that Dispatch Box that we are in close consultation with the United States upon the progress of these talks? Therefore, would the noble Lord be good enough to say clearly whether the proposals are on the table at Geneva and whether the talks are proceeding successfully?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01168"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect, that simply does not arise from the Question that is on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01169"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend have any idea as to where the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, wishes us all to be evacuated, and whether the noble Lord has plans to do a pathfinding mission to this unknown country himself on a one-way ticket?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01170"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I have some very sound ideas myself both as to where the noble Lord might be evacuated, and as to where my noble friend and I might be evacuated, but I think it might be better not to go into that now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01171"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord confirm that his last answer but two about the British thermonuclear force being a deterrent of last resort for this country, constitutes a change in the arrangement whereby it is assigned to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01172"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, again I am afraid that that is a completely different question and wide of the mark.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01173"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord not saddened, although no doubt not alarmed, by the enormous number of ways produced by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, of asking the same question over and over again?</membercontribution></p>
<col>332</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01174"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: Not alarmed, my Lords, but certainly saddened.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01175"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend agree that the important point is to continue to prevent war through remaining strong and deterring any possible aggression? Further, would he agree that if we one-sidedly throw our weapons away, we should make war and the loss of our freedom much more likely?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01176"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I entirely agree with everything that my noble friend says.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01177"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord tell us whether serious consideration can be given to the suggestion from behind me that everybody should be invited to have a nuclear base here? Then, under the system of deterrence, we would indeed be an effective nuclear-free zone.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01178"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord and the party opposite not agree that, on the question of nuclear war, there is at least a serious element, and that perhaps they might attune their minds to that particular element before we conclude this Question Time? For example, will the noble Lord not agree that what perturbs many people here and some of the people of our ally nations is the submission during the last big debate that, if there was an emergent invasion through Germany to France, in order to protect herself Great Britain would attempt to wipe out Russian armies with nuclear weapons, which would have devastating effects on the civil populations of NATO countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01179"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect, the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, is again going completely wide of the Question on the Order Paper. I do not think it would be right for me to go into another long debate on the whole nuclear issue, which was admirably covered last week by my noble friend Lord Belstead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01180"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that we seem to be agreed that General Altenburg made a statement but that we have seen different versions of that statement? Would it not be helpful to all noble Lords if the noble Lord were to clarify the issue by including the actual authorised statement in the <i>Official Report</i>&#x2014;of course, not authorised by the noble Lord, Lord Dacre&#x2014;which General Altenburg himself agreed that he made?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01181"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am quite sure that, if the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, contacted the radio source in Germany which conducted the interview, they would be very happy to supply him with their translation.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Soviet Visitors to United Kingdom</title>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01183"><member>Lord Bethell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01184">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01185">To ask Her Majesty's Government how many members of the All-Union Supreme Soviet or of the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0175"/>
<col>333</col>
Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation visited the United Kingdom during the past 12 months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01186"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, nor of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic, visited the United Kingdom in the past year in his capacity as a deputy of either of these bodies. However, several Soviet visitors to the United Kingdom during the past 12 months have been members of these institutions. Members of the USSR Supreme Soviet will visit the United Kingdom later this month, at the invitation of the Great Britain-USSR Association.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01187"><member>Lord Bethell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that Answer. Will he confirm that Britain does not discriminate on an individual basis against representatives of these Soviet bodies, which, with us, are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, whereas the Soviet Government do discriminate and pick and choose on an individual basis between British parliamentarians? Therefore, will he agree that the time has come to redress this imbalance and deal with applications from Soviet so-called parliamentarians on the basis of reciprocity?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01188"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can, of course, confirm to my noble friend that there is no discrimination in any sense. My noble friend rightly criticises the Soviet Union for refusing visas on general political grounds. We would not wish to follow the Soviet example by refusing a Soviet applicant solely in retaliation for their prior refusal of a British applicant. Our practice is that visas are refused only when there is clear evidence that the individual concerned is personally unacceptable to us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01189"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not remarkable that not one of the 1,500 elected members of the Supreme Soviet has ever asked a question critical of the defence policy of any Soviet Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01190"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are many things in heaven and earth that are remarkable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01191"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord say whether when anybody occupying an official position in the Soviet Union comes to the United Kingdom, that person is approached by anyone from our Foreign Office, or anyone occupying an official position in the United Kingdom, directing the visitor's attention to the constant and persistent violation of human rights in the Soviet Union as compared with our behaviour in this country&#x2014;for example, what is happening to Shcharansky at the present time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01192"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that any visitor to this country would immediately recognise what the country as a whole feels about human rights. As regards the other part of the noble Lord's supplementary question, I do not think that the duties of a member of the Supreme Soviet can be compared with the duties of a British parliamentarian.</membercontribution></p>
<col>334</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01193"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is there any prospect of a resumption of exchanges with the Supreme Soviet through the Inter-Parliamentary Union? They have proved to be of some value in the past, and the complete closing of dialogue with the Soviet Union would not be a very happy augury for the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01194"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no closing of dialogue with the Soviet Union at ministerial level. The House will be aware that my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary was in Russia last week, or possibly the week before, and, as I said in my original Answer, the Great Britain-USSR Association has arranged for members of the USSR Supreme Soviet to visit the United Kingdom later this month.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01195"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what is the IPU position?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01196"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry, but I have no information on that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01197"><member>Lord Bethell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how can there be parliamentary dialogue between the Soviet Union and Britain when the Soviet side are allowed to pick and choose with which British parliamentarians they have a dialogue?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01198"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would say that the boot is equally on the other foot, for Members of this Parliament can pick and choose whom they see in the Soviet Republic.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Bill</title>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01204"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House do now resolve itself into Committee on this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01205">Moved, That the House do now resolve itself into Committee.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Trefgarne.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01206">On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01207">House in Committee accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01208">[The LORD ABERDARE in the Chair.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01209">Clause 1 [<i>The Development Commission.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01210"><member>Lord Northfield</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 2, line 30, leave out subsection (8).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01211">The noble Lord said: I move this amendment, which would delete the power of the Government to give directions to the development commission in its new statutory form. I am of course aware that this is a normal power which the Government have in relation to bodies of this kind, and I move the amendment to seek certain assurances about the use of the Government's power that they will have to give directions, and about the degree of independence which the commission will have under the new r&#x00E9;gime.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01212">It does not need a Sherlock Holmes to realise that there has been a struggle about this particular provision. If one looks at Schedule 1 to the Bill, paragraph 11 indicates that the annual report of the commission will set out any direction given by the Secretary of State during the year. That is rather unusual if it really amounts to the commission being able to tell everybody what it was doing independently and what it was doing during the year under direct instructions of the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01213">The historic independence of the commission and the pioneering in support of the most disadvantaged rural areas that it has done for some 70 years or more are well known, but the catalogue&#x2014;and I could not give it today&#x2014;bears some examination to see how independent and pioneering it has been. It started just after the first world war in helping village industries and craftsmen from the early 1920s, first of all with an intelligence bureau with advice and information, and then on to a full rural industries bureau. We knew that later in the century as CoSIRA.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01214">Again in the early 1920s the commission was the body which effectively fostered the growth of the rural communilty councils, starting with Kent in 1925, originally working to help craftsmen and having rural industry organisers to help the organising of craftsmen in the rural areas. In 1940 it was the commissioners, under the existing Act, who started a loan fund for rural industry. They started grants for village halls in 1925. They have funded the National Federation of Women's Institutes since 1921.</p>
<col>336</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01215">In my own time as chairman of the commission, we set up the special investment areas which are now effectively the rural development areas. We broadened the whole of our activity to include action plans for the total revival of the more disadvantaged areas. Again, the commissioners spent a lot of money after the first world war on agricultural research. This was then floated off from the commissioners as the Agricultural Research Council, a very eminent body today. The commissioners at that period looked after fishery harbours, taken over by the Government in 1955. I give these just as examples of pioneering which the commission has always undertaken to help the rural areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01216">Now why is it important to seek assurances about the future? I repeat the point that this was pioneering Nearly all of it was a very substantial departure from the policy of the Government of the day. It would be disastrous if the commission were in future to be a creature of Government and he denied that continuous pioneering role which it has filled so effectively. In all of that work it nearly always has acted, and still acts today, as a catalyst. It does not put in a large amount of Government money. It offers a little Government money in return for people looking after themselves, or finding extra money from other sources.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01217">The power of the commission under the present Act depends on the fact that it is a standing Royal Commission for a start. It is appointed by Her Majesty. It is not just an ordinary quango. It has this rather extra status of being a Royal Commission. It advises Her Majesty's Government on the spending of the development fund. The development fund is money voted by Parliament every year to help the rural areas on matters for which no other statutory provision exists. It is, if you like, the supporter, until other forms of statutory provision take over, of new ideas which are being pioneered.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01218">The point about the commission is the extraordinary, unique power of the commissioners. It has what is known as a double veto. As the annual report of the commission makes clear, the commissioners cannot spend out of the development fund without the approval of Her Majesty's Government. But equally&#x2014;and this is the important point&#x2014;the Government cannot spend out of the development fund without the approval of the commissioners. I have never known an Act of Parliament which brought an outside body so near to control and strong influence over Government policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01219">What that in practice meant was that the two bodies, the Government and the commissioners, had all the time to reach agreement in the middle, otherwise they could veto each other. Most important of all, if the Government too often tried to stop the new ideas, the new departures, the pioneering of the commission the commission could wave the big stick and say, "If you go on like this we shall veto other spending out of the development fund". This is an important influence on public policy. It has been an important power. It has worked extremely well by continuously reaching agreement rather than falling out and using the veto between the two sides.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01220">Therefore, I say bluntly to the noble Lord, we are now going into a one-way street instead of a two-way
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0177"/>
<col>337</col>
street. The commission will not be able to prevent Government doing a lot of things any more if they fall out. It is a one-way street in which only the Government can give orders to the commission. Therefore, I ask will it still have this same freedom to pioneer that it has always had, or will it just be carrying out Government policy in the rural areas from now on? That pioneering role has been crucial to all the new departures I have listed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01221">Secondly, will it be the case, as before, that the Government will look to the commission to pioneer in this way and then will take over the commission's ideas when they prove fruitful and practicable and enshrine them in public policy so that the commission can use its resources, its expertise and its energies to find new ideas, to pioneer them again and bring extra new ideas to the help of the rural areas?</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01222">Finally, how much money is involved? Is the commission going to be allowed to have a reasonable budget to carry all this out so that it matches at least the sort of money that it has now and preferably goes on to, say, about &#x00A3;30 million a year as opposed to approaching &#x00A3;20 million, which would give it real independence and real power to carry on its most constructive work for the benefit of the disadvantaged rural areas? This is an important amendment on which I hope the noble Lord will tell us exactly what the Government's policy is for the future of this successful, unusual quango which has had such a great history up to now. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01223">3.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01224"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: We are indebted to my noble friend for putting down this amendment and for explaining his reasons for doing so. On Second Reading, as the Committee will recall, there were several tributes to the work of the commission and to the value of the 1909 Act. The noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, in particular, gave us the benefit of his own experience as a member of the commission; and my noble friend Lord Northfield, as a former chairman of the commission, obviously speaks with great authority.<lb/>
The position as of now, as my noble friend has explained it, is that a delicate balance exists between the Ministry and the commission. The 1909 Act serves two primary purposes. First, it ensures that the commissioners are informed of Government policy in the field of activity submitted as a scheme to the Ministry. Secondly, it enables the commission to make certain that no other source of funds is available. The Department of the Environment must approve advances from the development fund, and the Minister can veto the commissioners' recommendations. On the other hand, the Ministry cannot make any advances from the fund without the commissioners' recommendations.<lb/>
There are other related provisions, as the Committee knows, but that is the key one for the purposes of my noble friend's amendment. That is the sensitive balance to which he has referred. As he said, if the Government resisted too many of the initiatives for the revival of the countryside the commissioners could move to veto other expenditure. Of course, in
<col>338</col>
practice over the years this power was sufficient to cause both sides to co-operate and co-ordinate amicably; and as the noble Lord knows, and as I know from my experience when I was Secretary of State for Wales, it has worked extremely well. Clause 1(8) removes this balance and appears to deprive the new commission of a very important power. It strengthens the department at the expense of the new body, and may do so unnecessarily. It would also be helpful if the noble Lord could give us the information about the budget to which my noble friend referred.<lb/>
I hope, therefore, that the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, will tell us that he will accept my noble friend's amendment, or, if it is in any way technically deficient, that he will introduce another which will leave the commission with the discretion which it now enjoys. Our united wish is that the new commission should work well. It is in that spirit that I believe my noble friend makes his proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01225"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: It might be helpful if I make some brief general remarks before dealing with the specific points that have been put to me. Clause 1 and Schedule 1 together, including subsection (8), to which the amendment refers, replace the development commissioners and the development fund, established under the Development and Road Improvement Acts of 1909 and 1910, with the Development Commission, a statutory grant-aided corporation. Transitional provisions ensure that the present commissioners and staff continue in office without loss of status or rights, and that all the liabilities and assets of the development fund are transferred to the Development Commission to be established under this Bill.<lb/>
There have been many changes since 1909, and this measure is designed to give the commission a legal and financial status in line with present-day thinking on grant-aided non-governmental bodies. It will also resolve a legal doubt over the propriety of the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas (CoSIRA) being given Government funds to provide financial help to small firms. This change has no direct financial implications&#x2014;the size of the grant is recommended by Ministers to Parliament, after consultation with the commissioners, in estimates&#x2014;but it will allow certain simplifications of procedure and give the Development Commission a greater degree of autonomy in line with the Government's policy for it.<lb/>
Our object in drafting these provisions has been to preserve all that is best in the original enactments while giving the commission up-to-date powers and protection. The personnel of the commission and, for that matter, CoSIRA, will have continuity of employment, pay and pensions. The commission will take over the assets and liabilities of the development fund, and the present commissioners will remain in office. We envisage this part of the Bill being brought into force on 1st April 1984.<lb/>
To deal specifically with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, he is, as he told your Lordships, a former and distinguished chairman of the development commissioners, and has obviously spoken with a great deal of authority and experience. It might be helpful if I first seek to explain briefly the effect of the amendment. This will show why we would
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0178"/>
<col>339</col>
not welcome such a change. Removing subsection (8) from Clause 1 would take away the power of the Secretary of State to give general directions, and the duty of the commission to comply. Ministers are answerable to Parliament for the work of the commission, and other analogous bodies receiving public funds. Ministers cannot be held responsible unless they have power to control and direct within the framework laid down by Parliament. The form of words used in subsection (8), or something like them, can be found in a number of recent statutes.<lb/>
That said, I turn now to the main burden of what the noble Lord said, which was to the effect that we should give the Development Commission the maximum autonomy. These are sentiments very dear to the Government's heart. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Environment in another place reported in March last year the results of an interdepartmental review of the Development Commission and the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas. The review confirmed the Government's belief in the effectiveness and relevance of the commission's work.<lb/>
My right honourable friend announced a number of steps to give it greater independence of action. In particular, the commission, instead of the Government, is to choose the areas of greatest need in which it will concentrate its work. They are to be called rural development areas. However, no line on a map can contain all areas of need, and the Government have allocated funds for use outside these areas at the discretion of the commission. CoSIRA will continue to provide its services in all rural areas. Another way in which we want to emphasise the independence of the commission takes expression in this Bill. At present, the commission only advises expenditure. In future, if this Bill becomes law, it will then spend its own grant in aid.<lb/>
Now manpower and money. The Government were elected on a programme of reducing direct Government involvement and giving value for money. A general policy of holding manpower numbers throughout the public sector at the prevailing levels, wherever possible, was applied to the commission and to CoSIRA. Increases are not automatically refused. In fact, there has been one approved increase and one approved decrease, following a restructuring and up-grading, since we came to power. The commission understands our view that its principal task is to persuade others to take action in their own communities, keeping to a minimum the functions which it undertakes for itself. As for funds, the commission has had all it can spend, and it is the Government's intention to give all the support they can to the employment-creating work in hand.<lb/>
Increasingly, public funds are used in a pump-priming or "lender of last resort" role, and the Government are grateful for the imaginative way in which the commissioners have found ways to attract private finance. We believe this to be the right way forward. In general terms I can give the noble Lord, Lord Northfield, the assurances he is seeking: that we shall be directing the commission's affairs much less under future arrangements than has been the case hitherto, and that the splendid work the commission has been doing up to now will continue and will be
<col>340</col>
increased. I hope that with those assurances the noble Lord will see fit to withdraw his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01226"><member>Lord Northfield</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord has been quite helpful. However, I should not have traded the old Act for the new one. The commission was making good use of the old Act under a sharing of power with Government. It was unique in the history of bodies of this kind. We shall have to watch very carefully whether the one-way street that we are now in&#x2014;in which only the Government can give the orders, and the commission has no effective right of fight-back with a veto&#x2014;works to the disadvantage of the commission. Nevertheless, I take the general assurances that the noble Lord has given. We will watch and I shall consider what he has said, but for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01229"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: I follow my noble friend in thanking the noble Lord for his reply to my noble friend's speech. I confirm what my noble friend said: namely, that we shall be scrutinising carefully the activities of the commission in relation to the Department of the Environment in future. There is no doubt that the commission has been deprived of a substantial power that it enjoyed under the old dispensation.<lb/>
The noble Lord made one important point: that the commission will have power to designate rural development areas. This leads me to ask the noble Lord a question which I put to him in another way in my speech on Second Reading. I refer specifically to the position in Wales and Scotland. In Wales the Welsh Rural Development Board designates an area within which it operates. The same is true of Scotland and the Highlands and Islands Development Board. But there are rural areas outside the designated areas of the WRDB and outside the boundaries of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. It seems therefore that rural areas in England&#x2014;all of which are covered by the activities of the Development Commission&#x2014;will enjoy substantial benefits not enjoyed by areas in Wales and Scotland, which are outside the designated areas of two boards I mentioned but which are, nevertheless, in need of assistance.<lb/>
I come back to an area in which I have a great interest; that is, north-west Wales, an area covered more or less by the boundaries of Gwynedd. In that area, there are great rural problems. If I may remind the noble Lord and the House that unemployment there now runs at nearly 25 per cent. of the insured population, the House will appreciate that there is a grave problem, that rural industries need assistance and that there is also a need for new rural industries to assist young school-leavers in particular to find the training opportunities, apprenticeships and work in general. Is it the case that the Development Commission and CoSIRA will be able to designate any part of rural England as a rural development area but that there is no authority in Wales and Scotland outside the two rural boards which will be able to carry out this provision?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0179"/>
<col>341</col>
In reply to my question on Second Reading, the noble Lord said that CoSIRA will continue to operate in Wales and Scotland, presumably as agents of the Welsh Development Agency and the Scottish Development Agency. My short question to the noble Lord is whether the Welsh Development Agency and its counterpart in Scotland will be able, through CoSIRA, to designate rural development areas in the same way as they will be designated in England by the commission.</membercontribution></p>

I will clarify the position and write to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01243">On Question, Whether Schedule 1 shall be agreed to?</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01244"><member>Lord Northfield</member><membercontribution>: I should again like to ask the noble Lord a question on Schedule 1 which governs the
<col>342</col>
operation of the commission. The schedule has a paragraph dealing with staff. I am very concerned about one particular remark that the noble Lord made earlier; namely, that the Government restriction on staff numbers is being applied to this body. Headquarters staff of the Development Commission number only 36 people. It is a body which is carrying out a vast amount of work on a handful of people. One of its great successes has been it has had for its servants some young and very dedicated staff who, over the years, work all hours and who, in every respect, put so much enthusiasm behind their job that they can manage on very small numbers.<lb/>
If this body is to become a fully recognised rural development agency and build on these beginnings the last thing it wants at this stage is to be restricted unduly to a staff of 36. This recognition is what all of us were working for throughout the 1970s as we gradually expanded its activities and status and took it into new parts of the country so that there are now, I think, well over 1,000 small factories under construction with agreements with county and borough councils up and down the country about joint plans to revive their most disadvantaged rural districts.<lb/>
I am hoping the noble Lord will be good enough to qualify what he has said about this, so that, in order that it shall be a fully-developed agency for want of another half a dozen more people, it is not going to be running up against a Government veto in that respect. This is a very important matter for a very dedicated body which is doing a great deal of work by stealth. I hope that the noble Lord will qualify what he has said about the restrictions on staffing levels.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01245"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I can assure the noble Lord that there will be no blind enforcement of any arbitrary level of staffing of the commission under the new arrangements. Of course, it is not possible for the Government to give some <i>carte blanche</i> to the commission when funds are provided by Parliament; but, as I have said earlier, we are fully seized of the important work that the commission does, and if they come forward with a case which on its merit is sound, I am certain that we shall agree to it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01260"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 1, line 8, leave out ("month") and insert ("months")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01261">The noble Lord said: For the benefit and convenience of the Committee&#x2014;and certainly not the Government&#x2014;I shall move Amendment No. 1 and speak to Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 because these amendments all have the same theme, which is to try to obtain a system whereby the increases in benefits are taken by decisions every six months. The Government may feel that this is impossible; but nothing is impossible in this computerised age, and in fact it seems that the computer given to the Conservative Party by a benevolent friend has even forecast the date of the election, something with which I dealt on the Second Reading. Seriously, the question involved in these amendments is simply that it would be greater justice to have a six-monthly review than the system proposed in this Bill. My reasons for this are quite simple. Some of us perhaps have serious doubts about the intentions of the Government in having 31st May stipulated in this Bill for the decision on pension increases in November, simply because of the forecast rate of inflation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01262">But this might arise in any Government at any time, and we feel there is greater justice and more common sense in this, in that it may be that in the first six months of decision, the estimate might be out and in November the adjustment can be made&#x2014;and nobody can complain about that&#x2014;so that there is a degree of continuity. I accept absolutely and completely that it would be impossible to have a period of less than six months.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01263">There is an amendment down, Amendment No. 9, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Banks, for a new clause which ties up very much with what I am proposing now. My amendment, however, goes into
<col>344</col>
detail; and quite honestly I cannot see why there should be any opposition to it. The only opposition may be that at the immediate moment it could be inconvenient. But, looking ahead, and bearing in mind the tremendous advances made in technology, there is not the slightest doubt that justice could be done and could be seen to be done on all sides by having this six-monthly review.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01264">Arguments can be produced that previous Governments should have done this; but those arguments are no excuse for our not dealing with it now. After all, as I said, we are in a new age that has come upon us somewhat rapidly. I do not intend to proceed further with my remarks on these amendments; but I commend them to the Committee as being reaonable and necessary. I concede the possible arguments that this cannot be done this year. I am prepared to receive an argument on that basis. But, on the general principle, and the principle involved in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Banks, I do not think I am prepared to concede anything. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01265"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: I should like to express support for these amendments, general sympathy with their purpose and I support the concept of bi-annual upratings. As I made clear when we had the debate on Second Reading, I think the Government are right to go back to the historical method instead of the forecast method; but I think that the timing of doing it is wrong and that it should not be done at a time when inflation is expected to rise because that involves a loss. The chief drawback in the historical method is the degree of delay which is involved. Bi-annual upratings will cut that down. It used to be argued by Government that it took six to seven months to carry out the necessary calculations, and that therefore you could not have more than one uprating per year. But I think it became clear during the debate of this Bill in another place that it could be done within five months and therefore it is technically possible to do it twice in a year&#x2014;and other countries in fact manage to do so. France and Denmark have pensions reviewed twice yearly in relation to the index. In Finland and the Netherlands there is an automatic increase after a 3 per cent. rise in the index. In Luxembourg there is a similar automatic increase after a 5 per cent. rise. In Belgium, it follows automatically upon changes in a prices-and-wages index. It can be argued they have different systems and that ours would need to be accommodated to this idea. Perhaps that is no bad thing and we should think out ways of doing what other people have managed to do. At any rate, it is clear that it is not impossible to have the historic method and to have bi-annual upratings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01266">3.36 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01267"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: The burden of these amendments is that benefits could and should be uprated twice a year rather than once. In this context, three factors have fundamental importance: necessity, cost and operational feasibility. The main case to be made for more frequent upratings on grounds of necessity arises in times of high and rapidly rising inflation. For example, the argument for six-monthly upratings was particularly relevant in 1974 and 1975 when the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0181"/>
<col>345</col>
annual rate of inflation rose from a low point of under 12 per cent. to a high point of 26.9 per cent.<lb/>
In such circumstances, the value of benefits was eroding almost as fast as new rates could be fixed. Once the annual rate of inflation fell below 20 per cent., the then Government quickly moved to an annual cycle of uprating. It is an entirely different matter when inflation has been brought down to low, single figures and when the Government intend that it should fall still further. I hope that your Lordships will agree that the inflation situation now is very different from that which existed in 1975 when inflation indeed made more frequent uprating a real necessity. By way of illustration, in the four months from November 1982 to March 1973, which is the latest figures I have at the moment, the R.P.I. had risen by only 0.6 per cent.<lb/>
I turn now to costs. Six-monthly upratings would add hundreds of millions of pounds per year to the benefit cost of upratings. For example, a May uprating in addition to the normal November uprating would add about &#x00A3;150 million to uprating costs in 1983/84 for each 1 per cent. brought forward. Even if the uprating were to be restricted only to pensions and long-term benefits, the extra cost for each 1 per cent. brought forward would be of the order of &#x00A3;100 million. If there were additional resources of this order available to incorporate in the general social security budget then the proper place for consideration of such matters would be in the annual review itself. Apart from the high-benefit costs involved in more frequent upratings, there are administrative costs and difficulties which cannot lightly be ignored. It cannot be denied that it is operationally possible to uprate more than once a year; but it still takes the best part of six months to carry out the work of each uprating so that a system of twice-yearly upratings would mean a need for more staff and it would mean that large numbers of DHSS staff would need to be permanently deployed on such work. Sometimes our uprating systems have been compared unfavourably with those of other countries, particularly in relation to our partners in the European Community. But this is an unfair comparison because it does not compare like with like. For example, while most member states provide some special help for those with low incomes, including pensioners, our system of supplementary benefit is not in general matched in other EC countries. Furthermore, of the other nine member states, only the Republic of Ireland who also uprate annually, pays its pensions weekly by order-book. All the other states pay their pensions monthly, or, in the case of Italy, every two months, either by post or by credit transfer. If all beneficiaries in this country were to change to a credit transfer system of monthly payment, our operational difficulties would be lessened too.<lb/>
Recently we gave our pensioners the option of having their pensions paid by credit transfer to a hank or building society, but first returns show that only a very tiny percentage of weekly-paid pensioners have opted to change to that method of payment. As long as our pensioners prefer to have their pensions paid weekly by order-book, we shall have to live with the difficulties that their choice entails. Improved technology will eventually shorten the time taken to
<col>346</col>
deal with the complex process of reassessing the three to four million supplementary benefit cases which are currently reassessed clerically, but it is unlikely that significant time savings will be achieved within the next few years.<lb/>
Finally, I should remind noble Lords that the cost of benefit increases have to be paid for by the working population. Contributions and taxes have to rise to meet the extra cost involved, and this leads workers to press for more frequent pay increases in compensation. This adds to inflationary pressures and serves to undo the good work of recent years in bringing down inflation to low single figures and in helping to make our industry more competitive in world markets. Now that we have inflation under control, it seems sensible to keep it under control and to reduce it still further so that pensioners may be spared the worry which inflation brings. I hope that, in the light of these arguments, the noble Lord will not wish to press his amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01268"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: I do not have any intention of pressing them at the present time, for various reasons. At the same time I cannot accept entirely what the noble Lord has said in reply. One of the problems is that his department has been cutting staff. In fact the whole theme of his speech was the necessity for financial savings. He said it would cost hundreds of millions of pounds to do this double check up each year. I cannot accept this, because he is dealing with the old methods that have been employed, whereas I am suggesting that modern methods should be used. His whole theme was financial saving, which is the basis of this and every other social security Bill that we have had since the start of this Parliament.<lb/>
There is a further point regarding a twice-yearly review. If the noble Lord had seen some of the letters I have received thanks to a small notice in the press on my comments on the Bill, he would realise that pensioners are in a different world altogether so far as the question of prices is concerned. This is something that every Government must consider, whether it be this one or the next one, whatever the next one may be. The noble Lord said they had asked for people to have their payments made directly into bank and Giro accounts. In fact, what he does not realise&#x2014;and I am talking about the average pensioner and not those fortunate ones like myself who have another pension through service in another place&#x2014;is that many pensioners have to rely desperately upon their single pension and it is small wonder that there has been very little response. Anybody who is in touch with these people&#x2014;and I would give noble Lords opposite credit because a lot of them are&#x2014;would understand. So far as benefits are concerned, the costs must be related to our intention to see that those at the lowest point of the income scale are given a reasonable standard of living. I say from this Box that, if sacrifices are necessary through taxation in order to achieve that ideal, then we as a nation would stand high in the world.<lb/>
I do not want to intrude upon a defence debate or anything like that, but there is never hesitation when the question of defence expenditure arises. That is money possibly&#x2014;though I hope to God it will not be&#x2014;for the eventual destruction of humanity
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0182"/>
<col>347</col>
somewhere or another. I am concerned with the people who are in need and who have served this country, whether as dustmen or brilliant technologists. That is why I hope the Government will consider the position further, particularly the question of the review that I am calling for, and taking into account the price situation as it affects elderly people.<lb/>
As I have indicated, I shall not press the amendments, at this stage. I understand that there may be a Report stage and a Third Reading. As I said on Second Reading, the whole thing is being rushed; and now today we know why. What happens on Report stage will have to be decided after I have read the noble Lord's remarks. In the meantime, in order to assist the Committee, I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 1.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 1, line 17, at end insert ("except that, if in the second year of operation the application of this provision has not been sufficient to maintain the real value of benefits at the November 1982 level then an appropriate adjustment will be made in the percentage increase for the third year.")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01272">The noble Lord said: I beg to move Amendment No. 3 and, with the leave of the Committee, to speak also to Amendment No. 8. This is the amendment standing in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, and myself. May I say that the name of my noble friend Lord Kilmarnock should have been added, but it does not in fact appear on the Marshalled List.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01273">I think we would all agree that if inflation is running at an annual rate of 4 per cent. in May, this month, and if it will be 6 per cent. next November, the beneficiaries will suffer a loss in the first year. It has been argued that this loss will be made up in the following year. The Secretary of State, Mr. Norman Fowler, in another place said this during the Second Reading debate, at col. 820:
<quote>"What will happen under the proposed system is that any inflation between May and November of this year or any subsequent year will automatically be caught up in the following up-rating".</quote>
In other words, the loss suffered in the first year and which of course will not be repaid, will not be lost in the second year. That is not necessarily true. There is no guarantee that the loss will be made up, and I should like to explain why I say that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01274">In November 1982 there was an over-estimate of inflation of 2.7 per cent. so that the figure of increase was higher than the actual inflation would have allowed. We on these Benches are anxious that that amount should not be clawed back: in other words, we want to maintain the November 1982 value of benefits. We want there to be no difference between the real value of benefits at November 1984, when compared with November 1982: that is, that the second year should in fact catch up.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01275">Under the new method the difference in up-rating between November 1982 and November 1984 will relate to a reference period, May 1982 to May 1984. That is under the method proposed in this Bill. Under the old method, it would have referred to November 1982 to November 1984. November 1982 to May 1984 is common to both of those reference periods.
<col>348</col>
The new method has six months, May to November 1982, at the beginning added to it and the old method has six months, May to November 1984, at the end of it. Therefore, the difference between the two methods will depend upon the difference between the rise of prices in these two six-monthly periods at either end.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01276">We know what the rise in prices was in the first six months, May to November 1982. It was only 1&#x00B7;3 per cent., which was abnormally low. If prices rise by 1&#x00B7;3 per cent. or less between May and November 1984, the real value as at November 1982 will have been maintained. But if prices rise by more than 1&#x00B7;3 per cent. between May and November 1984, the real value as at November 1982 will have been reduced and that, I think most of us would agree, is the most likely outcome.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01277">This amendment would ensure that if the 1982 value declined in this way between 1982 and 1984, then an adjustment to take care of that would be made in the 1985 uprating. Thus, the November 1982 value would have been preserved. So that is the object of this amendment. It is to make sure that the November 1982 value is maintained, and it will not necessarily be maintained unless some special provision is made to ensure that that is so. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01278">3.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01279"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: I rise briefly to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Banks. He has moved it so clearly and so ably that there is little need for me to go into a great deal of detail. I noticed that, when the Minister was replying to the earlier amendment, he referred to the extra cost that would be incurred if the changes that we wish for were made. If there is an extra cost to the Government, that must mean a loss to the beneficiaries. When he talks about all these thousands of pounds being a charge on the Government, it makes us feel that we really ought to look at those thousands of pounds of which beneficiaries are being deprived. It cannot work both ways.<lb/>
Another reason why I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Banks, is that there is a volatility in prices and, as my noble friend Lord Wallace said, that volatility particularly affects pensioners, the unemployed and people who are at the receiving end of these benefits, because many of the points which affect the price index are not reflected in the budgets of these people.<lb/>
Another point which makes me support this amendment is the unfairness of the inability to catch up. For instance, if anybody dies in the period between one point of calculation and another, there is no compensation for his family. If the index has risen and then an unfortunate person dies, that money is lost forever. So the idea that we will catch up next year does not apply, especially to a lot of elderly people. Neither does it apply to the strange and unusual case of a person on unemployment benefit who might, even under this Government, suddenly find a job. He will then be taken out of unemployment benefit and will never be compensated for the shortfall in the unemployment benefit that he received when he was out of work, because he will have got back to work.<lb/>
If the noble Lord can explain that that is not the case, then I shall be happy to listen to him, but we

think that this is a very fair amendment. This question of the real benefit must be more carefully considered, and some way must be found of making it up to people who suffer from the proposals in this Bill. So I support this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01280"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: I just want to confirm that it was intended that my name should appear on the amendment, and I have received a handsome apology from the Public Bill Office for the fact that it did not. I shall not detain your Lordships, but I just want to revert to the point I made on Second Reading, which was that we on this Bench support, in principle, the idea of a reversion to the historic method of calculation. We also feel it is extremely important that the new method should not only get off to a fair start, but should be seen to get off to a fair start. It seems to me that the amendment, which has been very ably proposed and moved by the noble Lord, Lord Banks, takes care of this. We therefore feel that it is a reasonable point to which the Government should pay serious consideration. It could be a one-off adjustment to make sure that the whole thing gets going on the right basis. We therefore support the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01281"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: The purpose of this amendment is plain, even if it is far from clear, I fear, that as drafted it would achieve the desired result. It provides a variation on a theme which has already been the subject of extensive debate, both here and in the other place. Up to now, the suggestion has been that there should be some form of adjustment to benefits in 1984, if this year's up-rating increase is less than the percentage rise in prices from November 1982 to November 1983. The noble Lord, Lord Banks, goes one stage further than that by proposing to delay any adjustment of this kind until we have had at least two up-ratings on the new basis.<lb/>
I am afraid that the Government cannot support this amendment. The whole purpose of the Bill is to restore certainty and stability to the up-rating process. We no longer wish to be looking over our shoulder at minor variations in the annual inflation rate from one month to another. We want to get away from all questions of overshoot, shortfall or adjustment. Our simple proposal is that the actual year-on-year rise in prices each May shall be used to determine the rise in benefits in the following November. On Second Reading, I spelled out why the May figures are the latest actual figures we can use, if beneficiaries are to get their increases paid on time. When we reach a position where we can move to a known figure later than May, we will gladly do so, but that time is not yet here.<lb/>
This year the change in method is being introduced in favourable circumstances for pensioners, despite the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Banks, on this point on Second Reading and again today. A significant part of the rise in prices from May 1982 to May 1983 has already been reflected in the November 1982 benefit increase, yet it will also count towards the increase in November 1983. The increase in November 1982 was 2&#x00B7;7 per cent. higher than was justified by the actual rise in prices in the preceding 12 months, yet the 1983 up-rating will still reflect a full 12 months' movement
<col>350</col>
of prices from May to May, and any rise in prices in the 12 months from May 1983 will automatically be taken into account in the 1984 up-rating.<lb/>
It is better to proceed on this simple and reliable basis than to look back to some base year of no particular relevance to the pensioner. What pensioners will be looking for in 1984 and 1985 is not what they had in November 1982, but whether the rate of inflation can be further reduced below the present level so that they need no longer fear it, as they did throughout the 1970s.<lb/>
This Government are more firmly committed to bringing down the rate of inflation than any of the other major parties. The smaller and more stable the annual rate of inflation, the less the chance of any significant difference between the May inflation rate and the November inflation rate. Pensioners know that their benefit rises will relate to the annual movement of prices and not to the inherent uncertainties of a forecast system. The Government's position is therefore clear. The November 1982 overshoot is not being clawed back. Pensioners and others have enjoyed that over-provision throughout 1983, and the rates set in 1982 will form the basis of future up-ratings under the historic method. Any further improvement in the value of pensions must, I fear, depend upon the country's economic performance, the generation of new wealth and the ability of taxpayers and contributors to meet the necessary extra costs.<lb/>
In the light of these explanations, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Banks, and those who supported him, will be persuaded to withdraw these amendments. If he presses them, I hope that your Lordships will reject them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01282"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Lord sits down, can he say whether the Government will provide any recompense for people who have had an underpayment of benefit because of inflation and who then, because of getting a job, never, apparently, obtain recompense for the period during which they have been underpaid in relation to inflation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01283"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: In the context both of this amendment and of the earlier one, I have already explained why more frequent up-ratings are not appropriate. What the noble Baroness is really asking for, I think, is a weekly up-rating arrangement, or some such arrangement as that, whereby pensioners are always paid benefit precisely in line with the level of inflation. That, I am afraid, is not a practicable proposition, and I cannot hold out any hope of the Government thinking otherwise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01284"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: I apologise for not making myself clear. I was not talking about pensioners. I thought I referred quite clearly to the unemployed who will have been receiving unemployment benefit at a rate below inflation but who, if they get a job before the year of reassessment is up, will never get that loss of money paid back.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01285"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I understood the noble Baroness was referring to unemployment benefit recipients. I remember that she referred earlier to pensioners who
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0184"/>
<col>351</col>
might suffer a similar disadvantage by dying in between up-ratings. The same argument applies to unemployment benefit recipients as applies to pensioners who sadly die while in receipt of pension in between up-rating points: that in order to ensure that unemployment benefit recipients are not disadvantaged in the way the noble Baroness describes, up-ratings on a very frequent basis would be necessary. For the reasons I have described, I fear that this is not possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01286"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: The reason why this amendment was put down was because there is no guarantee that the up-rating in the second year will make good the loss which I think we are all agreed is bound to take place in the first year. The noble Lord did not address himself to that point. He said he did not think that the amendment would achieve its purpose, but he did not say why he did not think it would achieve its purpose. He said he wanted to get away from overshoot or shortfall. The whole purpose of my argument was to show that under the present system you could not get away from overshoot and shortfall. If, therefore, you did not want to lose value, it was necessary to have an arrangement of this kind. I can well understand that these are quite complicated arguments to take in when expressed verbally. Therefore, I believe it is only right that the Minister should have an opportunity to read what I have said and then to answer the points I have raised. For that reason, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, but I hope to return to it at a later stage.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01292"><member>Lord Banks</member> moved Amendment No. 9:
<quote>After Clause 2, insert the following new clause:</quote>
<quote>(". The Secretary of State shall, not later than six months after the date on which this Act comes into force, recommend to Parliament a method to provide for bi-annual upratings of the retirement pension.")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01293">The noble Lord said: The earlier amendments dealing with bi-annual up-ratings obliged the Government to up-rate twice a year. The noble Lord put forward objections to that: administrative objections, and objections as to the cost of benefits and the cost of administration. This amendment does not oblige the Government to up-rate bi-annually at the start. It does not even oblige the Government to up-rate biannually at any time. All it does is to ensure that the Government recommend a method of doing this to Parliament within six months of the Act coming into force. We know that other countries manage to do this. We realise that there are perhaps difficulties within our own system which would need to be removed in some way if we were to do the same as other countries, but there is no reason why we should not do the same. We know that technically it is possible so to do. Therefore, all the amendment asks is that the Government should look at this question to see how what is done in other countries could be done here, and to recommend such a change in due course. I beg to move Amendment No. 9.</p>
<col>352</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01294"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: I rise to support this amendment, which I consider to be excellent and also extremely acceptable to the Government, who now have the opportunity to prove that they are prepared to look into the future with, shall I say, a more benevolent eye than they have looked into the past since they have been in office. This is an arrangement whereby the Government can make up their mind in due course. It does not tie them down to detail, as did my amendments, excellent though they were. If the Government refuse this amendment, the mind boggles. There is no reason whatever why any reasonable Government should not accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01295"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: We on this Bench support the amendment. It is worth pointing out&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Coslany, hinted at it&#x2014;that this amendment is very similar to one which was put down by one of the Government's own Back-Bench supporters in another place, who pointed out when moving it that the Conservative party had made election pledges on two occasions to bring about a reform of this nature when they came to power but that it had not happened. I am very glad that in this Committee the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has finally put to death the ground of administrative impossibility of a biannual up-rating. It is interesting that the noble Lord has admitted that it is possible, in direct contradiction to what the Minister, Mr. Rossi, said in another place at col. 327 on Wednesday, 20th April: that bi-annual up-ratings are so administratively difficult as to be beyond contemplation. The noble Lord, I am glad to say, has corrected that error.<lb/>
It is obvious from the implications of the Bill before the Committee at the moment that if the Government are planning to make an announcement in June&#x2014;17th June has been mentioned for an up-rating&#x2014;and if it is to be in place for implementatation by 21st November, the period would be five months and one week. Therefore, by implication, in this Bill it is perfectly clear that an up-rating can be performed in just over five months. This is exactly what the amendment proposes, if the Bill becomes law.<lb/>
The administrative cost is not great. It is about &#x00A3;10 million per bi-annual up-rating. It is clear that we should get feasibility and the fact that it is not costly out of the way. The remaining important consideration is simply that of the effect on public expenditure. If the Government are going to reject this idea, they must come clean and reject it on the grounds of additional public expenditure. The Government would indeed incur extra cost on a rising rate but if, on the other hand, inflation continues on a steady path or on a downward path then the Government would save money.<lb/>
Finally, this proposal seems to me to be a logical extension of the Government's own proposal to make the up-rating system fairer, more accurate, and more in tune with the real and actual inflation rate ruling at the time. On those grounds, and on the grounds of the Government's previous election pledges, I can see no reason why the Government can possibly reject this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01296"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if I do not again deploy all the arguments
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0185"/>
<col>353</col>
I deployed against earlier amendments along these lines. As I ventured to suggest then, Conservative support for this idea, which certainly was around in 1974 or 1975, was in the context of a rate of inflation in excess of 20 per cent. I am ready to accept now the arguments in favour of this sort of arrangement when inflation is running at that sort of level. But we are now facing inflation at a wholly different level&#x2014;something below 5 per cent., I suppose, at the present time. So it follows that the necessity for more frequent up-rating falls away.<lb/>
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, that it is not possible to say that two annual up-ratings are a physical impossibility so far as the DHSS are concerned. However, it is a very major undertaking, let me say. The noble Lord referred to a figure of &#x00A3;10 million for administrative costs. It is at least that. It involves the employment of some 1,300 extra staff, which is not a prospect we would lightly entertain. However, the essential point is that upon which the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, put his finger&#x2014;that the extra costs in terms of the increased benefit that would have to be paid out will be very substantial. I referred in my earlier remarks to a sum of about &#x00A3;150 million in respect of each 1 per cent. brought forward in this way.<lb/>
I have to tell the Committee that unless we are to somehow reduce existing benefits to cope with that additional cost, we shall be imposing an additional burden of this amount upon employers and employees. That is not something they would lightly entertain. Indeed, I believe it would be widely regarded as unfortunate, and it is not something that I am prepared to recommend to your Lordships. I hope that, for the reasons deployed earlier in relation to the other amendments and now underlined again by me, the noble Lord, Lord Banks, will not press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01297"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, referred to the fact that an additional 1,300 staff would be necessary. There is the possibility that, by taking 1,300 people from the unemployment queue and thus relieving the state of the need to pay unemployment benefit, there will be some saving of public money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01298"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: The difficulty is that I do not believe there are 1,300 experts of this kind on the unemployment register.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01299"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: Then train them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01300"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: I must say that I find the reply of the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, disappointing. I had hoped that the Government would be prepared to accept the concept of bi-annual up-ratings even if they were not prepared to incorporate this as something that would be brought into practice as soon as the Bill becomes law. As my noble friend Lord Kilmarnock pointed out, it seems that public expenditure is the only substantial ground on which this proposal is registered.<lb/>
If there is an increase half way through the year, it is true that a certain amount of expenditure would be
<col>354</col>
added in the next six months that otherwise would not have been made&#x2014;but the increase at the end of that six months will not be so great as if the first up-rating had not been undertaken. So I am not sure that the argument that the noble Lord has put to us is as strong as he thinks it is. I believe that there is a very strong argument in principle for establishing that we want to move towards bi-annual upratings. For that reason, I should like to test the opinion of the Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>County Courts (Penalties for Contempt)<lb/> Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01307">4.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01308"><member>The Lord Chancellor (Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to move that this Bill be now read a second time. Its purpose is to restore the position which everyone had assumed was the existing law before the 10th March this year, when your Lordships in your judicial capacity gave judgment in the case of <i>Peart v. Stewart.</i> In that case it was held that a county court was an "inferior court" for the purposes of Section 14 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981, and that accordingly its power to deal with civil contempts was limited to 30 days' imprisonment. rather than two years.<lb/>
For well over a century, by virtue of what is now Section 74 of the County Courts Act 1959, the county courts have had the same power as the High Court to deal with civil contempts&#x2014;that is to say, breaches of injunctions. In paragraph 204 of their report, the Phillimore Committee recommended no change. The purpose of Section 14 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 was simply to substitute a fixed instead of an indefinite term in such cases and to impose a maximum of two years on the terms of imprisonment which could be imposed on any occasion. It was not the intention to create any difference between the High Court and the county courts in this regard.<lb/>
During the preparation of the Bill the question was raised as to whether the drafting, and in particular the
<col>356</col>
definition of "superior court" in Section 19, was really clear enough for the purposes of Section 14, and I was assured that it was. Since I am responsible for the drafting of Bills&#x2014;of that Bill, at any rate&#x2014;which I introduce, I apologise for the error. It is fair to say that no discussion took place on the Floor of the House and that the advice I received on the subject was entirely reassuring.<lb/>
From the point of view of policy it is vital, I am afraid, that the <i>status quo</i> as between High Court and county court should be preserved for this purpose. The county court now has a wide matrimonial jurisdiction, apart from everything else, and a general jurisdiction wider than ever before. If I may give one example, which is slightly diverting, sent to me by a judge who was rightly disturbed by the decision in <i>Pearl v. Stewart</i>, I will quote his letter, as follows:
<quote>"I write to bring to your attention the distress, difficulties and expense which the decision in <i>Peart v. Stewart</i> is causing in practice.</quote>
<quote>"I have at least one unbalanced man resident within the district of this court. He has a mania for molesting and assaulting the woman with whom he formerly lived. I made a non-molestation injunction against him, which he ignored. I sent him inside for five days. The next time he did it, I sent him down for 14 days. On the third occasion, the judge who was taking my list for me while I was sitting in crime, very sensibly sent him down for six months, but having regard to <i>Pearl v. Stewart</i> he was released after three months. This, I think, encouraged him and on his current breach he is again inside for one month. The woman concerned must be having a frightful time, knowing that he is likely to be hack on her doorstep before long.</quote>
<quote>"He now writes what I regard as his usual letter, saying that he will not offend again, and he will come before me early next week asking for an early release. I would not give very much for his chances of success, but he will be out before long and I expect will re-offend.</quote>
<quote>"Have I still got to play this ineffective 30 day game with him, with all the expense that it involves?</quote>
<quote>"The woman will be represented, on legal aid. Two bailiffs will have to take him to Bedford Prison over 50 miles each way. (Where he is well known and was welcomed last time by the Officer on the gate with the words 'Hello, you back again'.</quote>
<quote>"I thought at first I might be able to resolve some of the difficulty by transferring the matter to the High Court so as to get the extended and necessary jurisdiction, but I do not think I have power so to do. Nor, indeed, if I did, would it serve any useful purpose, because the Courts Administrator tells me the only authority he has to appoint me a deputy High Court judge is in divorce and wardship cases, and if it went to London even more expense would be caused".</quote>
My Lords, that letter speaks more eloquently than I of the necessity&#x2014;indeed, the urgent need&#x2014;of this Bill. So I beg to move that this Bill he now read a second time.</membercontribution></p>

Obviously it is essential that courts should have the power to enforce orders against recalcitrant parties, particularly in the case of those who have been subjected to orders arising from the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act, and the need to protect what&#x2014;alas&#x0021;&#x2014;is usually the lady who has been the subject of violence from the continuance of the violence against her. The noble and learned Lord has

<col>357</col>
pointed out that the jurisdiction of the county courts has of course increased very greatly in recent years, and the particular jurisdiction under the 1976 Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act is an important and useful illustration.<lb/>
It is also the case that county courts grant far more injunctions than any other court in England and Wales. Therefore, it is very important to get this matter clarified. I am bound to say that I share whatever responsibility there was for the failure to spot this point at the earlier stage with the noble and learned Lords dealing with <i>Peart</i>&#x2014;I should continue to pronounce it "pert" in case there is confusion with a most respected noble Lord in the House whose name is pronounced in a slightly different way and who assures me is no relation to any of the parties in question.<lb/>
This provision therefore to give to the county courts the same power as exists in the courts of superior jurisdiction seems to us to be right. It does not follow by any means that the message should go out that the county courts should necessarily impose penalties of imprisonment over the period of one month that they can presently exercise. The two years is a maximum term and they will no doubt exercise their discretion as they think fit in the use of that power against recalcitrant litigants who have refused to obey the orders of the court. In the circumstances, we agree with the passing of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Saint Christopher and Nevis Termination of<lb/> Association Order 1983</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01313">4.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01314"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 25th April be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01315">The noble Lord said: My Lords, nearly two years ago I had the honour of seeking your Lordships' approval of a draft Order in Council which made Antigua and Babuda a fully independent nation within the Commonwealth. She had previously been a West Indian Associated State under the West Indies Act 1967. Today it falls to me to ask your Lordships to approve another draft Order in Council confirming the same status on St. Kitts and Nevis, the sixth and last of the Associated States in the Eastern Caribbean to achieve this momentous step forward in the history of a people.</p>
<col>358</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01316">It is proposed that this order, which will be made under Section 10(2) of the Act, should come into effect on 19th September this year. Thereupon the islands of Saint Christopher and Nevis will become a fully independent sovereign federal domocratic state which should be described as the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis (of St. Kitts and Nevis) or simply Saint Christopher and Nevis (or St. Kitts and Nevis). Her Majesty the Queen will be head of the independent state. Under normal circumstances I would have waxed lyrical and eulogised on the beauty of the two islands and the long historical association between these islands and the United Kingdom, but in the event I think that perhaps it is better if I restrain myself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01317">The West Indies Act 1967 created the concept of associated statehood. This enabled certain small territories in the Eastern Caribbean, which were not then ready to move to full independence, to be given full internal self-government. The United Kingdom retained responsibility only for defence and external affairs, although certain of the latter responsibilities were also delegated to the Associated States' Governments. There has been a steady movement on the part of these states, over the past nine years, towards full independence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01318">The House of Assembly of St. Christopher and Nevis has by way of resolution requested termination under Section 10(2) of the 1967 Act, and there is no reason not to accede to that request. This is the same method as has been followed in the transition to independence of the other five former Associated States.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01319">British policy on the application of this section of the 1967 Act has been consistent under successive Governments. Provided that two particular criteria are met, we are prepared to move the necessary order. These criteria are: first, that it is demonstrated to our satisfaction that independence is the wish of the majority of the people in the state; and, secondly, that the independence constitution properly protects the rights and freedoms of these people. I am satisfied that both criteria have been met. A constitutional conference was held at Lancaster House in December under the chairmanship of my honourable friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. I was a regular attender at it. The coalition Government of St. Kitts and Nevis, led by Premier Dr. Simmonds, and an opposition delegation, led by Mr. Moore, participated.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01320">The draft before the conference had been prepared by the state Government and embodied proposals which were published in July 1982, subsequently discussed fully in the Associated State and approved by the state's House of Assembly in October. My honourable friend visited the islands later in October to meet the political leaders and to familiarise himself with the issues. He was entirely satisfied that all the political parties there were agreed on the principle of independence and that this was the wish of the majority of the people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01321">The constitutional conference produced a report which was a thoroughly considered basis for a constitution. Regrettably the opposition delegation felt that the proposals they put before the conference were not adequately discussed, and they participated intermit-
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0188"/>
<col>359</col>
tently, not taking part in the signing ceremony. I am satisfied, however, that their criticisms of the manner in which the conference was conducted were unjustified. When the St. Kitts and Nevis Government delegation were presented with reasoned, careful and constructive criticisms of the draft constitution they showed that they were prepared to go a considerable way towards meeting the opposition's point of view.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01322">The opposition had full opportunity to present their own proposals as well as to comment in detail on the draft constitution before the conference. The final version of the constitution, which incorporated amendments made in the light of conference decisions, was debated over a period of three days in the St. Christopher and Nevis House of Assembly. The constitution was then approved by a resolution of St. Kitts and Nevis House of Assembly, a copy of which I have had placed in the Library of this House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01323">The proposed constitution is similar to those under which the other Associated States became independent. In the opening statements by the premier and the leader of the opposition it rapidly bcame apparent that the possible secession of Nevis was still, after many years, a bone of contention. This is why it contains a number of novel features in that it contains provisions for the automony of Nevis within the federation, and for secession of Nevis from the federation. The provisions for Nevis to secede would require the introduction and the passage of a Bill in the Nevis Assembly supported by a two-thirds majority of the elected members. This would subsequently need to be approved by a referendum in Nevis by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast by persons registered on the parliamentary electoral roll there.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01324">Further provisions would ensure that adequate notification of the proposals for separation, including the proposals for its future constitution, would be given to enable proper discussion and explanation to take place. Arrangements would be made for independent and impartial observers appointed by an independent international body to observe the procedures involved in the referendum and to report publicly on the manner in which it had been carried out. The provisions for the Nevis legislature and administration, the financial provisions and the right of secession will be entrenched in the constitution. For this reason we are confident that the interests of the people of Nevis have been safeguarded.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01325">St. Kitts and Nevis will be the first dependent territory to become independent after the entry into force of the British Nationality Act 1981 on 1st January 1983. Those who were formerly citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies by virtue of a connection with St. Kitts and Nevis become British dependent territories citizens under the 1981 Act. They will become citizens of Saint Christopher and Nevis on independence day, when they will lose their British dependent territories citizenship unless they qualify for retention of that citizenship by virtue of a connection with a remaining dependency. No one will lose British citizenship as a result of the independence of St. Kitts and Nevis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01326">As the wish of the majority of the people of St. Kitts and Nevis is for independence, it is encumbent upon us to respond now to that wish. With full indepen-
<col>360</col>
dence, the state of St. Kitts and Nevis will be able further to develop its co-operation with neighbouring states, notably within the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, in the activities of which an independent St. Kitts and Nevis will be able to play a full part. This will be an important contribution to the stability of the region.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01327">Aid to St. Kitts and Nevis will continue after independence and we shall be discussing a suitable aid package with the St. Kitts-Nevis Government once this order is approved. We hope and expect that aid to St. Kitts and Nevis from other sources will increase as a result of independence.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01328">Finally, I am happy to inform the House that the St. Kitts and Nevis Government have announced their intention to apply for membership of the Commonwealth. We look forward to continuing our links with them within the Commonwealth. I know that the good wishes of the House will go to the Government and people of St. Kitts and Nevis as they approach their independence, an important stage in their development. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01329">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 25th April be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Skelmersdale.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01330">4.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01331"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are very grateful to the noble Lord for explaining the order to us. We are all concerned to ensure that the islands, which have been so closely associated with this country for so long, will enjoy a successful and prosperous future.<lb/>
I read the report of the constitutional conference to which the noble Lord has referred with great interest. I noted that there were some acute disagreements in the discussions which took place in December. The experience is that each of these islands in the Caribbean (some of them very small) has its own identity and its own ethos and that its people are sensitive about amalgamation and about constitutions in general. Being an islander myself, and having represented an island in another place for nearly 30 years, I can fully understand this attitude. There were many times when I felt, in frustration, that Anglesey should declare UDI. I can therefore well understand that there could be disagreement between the various parties. There is no difference of opinion about independence. The arguments over the constitutional arrangements&#x2014;and these are sincere and deeply held&#x2014;are profound. It is clear that doubts still remain, notwithstanding what the noble Lord has said.<lb/>
I have read the petition presented to Her Majesty the Queen by the St. Kitt's Labour Party, and I would refer to some of the points in it. They have of course argued for a federal form of government but not of the type which has now been agreed by Her Majesty's Government. What the St. Kitts Labour Party have been pressing for is a federal form with two subordinate legislatures. They say:
<quote>"The chief defect is simply this. No provision whatever has been made for any local Government or elected political institutions of any kind in the Island of St. Christopher, apart from the Federal Parliament".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0189"/>
<col>361</col>
They argue that Nevis is being granted an assembly with wide autonomous powers (with a Lieutenant Governor and a Premier) out of all proportion to its population, Nevis being much smaller than St. Kitts. They make the point that:
<quote>"the proposed Constitution locks the people of St. Christopher, a sugar island, into a straitjacket, of which Nevis, with no interest in sugar, is given the key".</quote>
They also say that representation in the single chamber legislature is unfairly weighted in favour of Nevis:
<quote>"an island with one fifth of the voters electing not less, but possibly more, than one third of the representatives".</quote>
As the noble Lord is aware, they ask for independence to be withheld until the constitution is amended to provide for a sub-legislature for St. Kitts on the lines of Nevis. That is the nub of the case of the St. Kitts Labour Party.<lb/>
The key question is whether there is adequate evidence that the electors of St. Kitts are in favour of the constitution. At what stage did it become clear to Her Majesty's Government that the majority of the population, or of the electors, of St. Christopher were in favour of this particular constitution? That is the requirement of Section 10(2) of the West Indies Act 1967, as the noble Lord is aware. I am informed&#x2014;perhaps the noble Lord can confirm or deny this&#x2014;that there remains substantial opposition to the constitution. I refer specifically to page 19 of the White Paper, which summarises the objections and gives details of the objectors. It seems to me that this is a formidable opposition and that it is incumbent on the noble Lord to explain to the House how the Government have been able to come to these present conclusions in the face of this opposition.<lb/>
I have received representations myself. If I may, I will read a paragraph from one letter from a native of the island. He says:
<quote>"The chief defect of the proposed constitution is that there is no provision for any elected representative body for St. Kitts itself other than the Federal Assembly, while Nevis would have its own separate legislature.</quote>
<quote>This inferior position in the new Federal State is not one from which St. Kitts can escape by secession, though secession is to be allowed to Nevis"&#x2014;</quote>
this is a point that the noble Lord made clearly in his speech. Thus the proposed constitution locks the people of St. Kitts, as I said before, into the straitjacket which I described. The letter goes on:
<quote>"At this late stage it may suffice to insert in the proposed constitution a provision that there should be an Assembly for St. Kitts, which should hold its first meeting within 12 months of the next elections".</quote>
The proposal made by this correspondent would be supported by the St. Kitts Labour Party. As this is the final stage of debate on this matter in Parliament, I think it right that I should summarise the case made by the petitioners, and I invite the noble Lord to reply to it.<lb/>
Before I conclude, may I say how much I welcome that section of the conference conclusions which deals with the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. I refer particularly to paragraph 11(a) of the White Paper. I think that this is sufficiently important for me to quote it:
<quote>"Provision would be made on the lines of the existing constitution for the protection of individual human rights. Additions to the
<col>362</col>
existing constitutional provisions would include provision for the right of a person to belong to a political party or other political association and protection of the individual against discrimination on grounds of sex or birth out of wedlock, as well as race, place of origin, political opinions or affiliations, colour or creed".</quote>
It is one of the tragedies of our time that these words and all that they imply are frequently flouted and disregarded. But they are fundamental and there can be no civilised existence without them. I hope that the current disagreements can be swiftly resolved. I was glad to hear the noble Lord say that the matter of aid is to be a subject of discussion very soon. I hope therefore that these two islands will have a successful and happy history.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01332">4.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01333"><member>Lord Pitt of Hampstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this will be a very historic moment for your Lordships' House. I hope that your Lordships realise it. Although much history has been seen here, with the independence of St. Kitts/Nevis we are seeing what is virtually the end of the British Empire. St. Kitts/Nevis has the distinction of having been the first British colony in the Caribbean, and, as your Lordships can see, it is almost the last. It is certainly the last of the Associated States.<lb/>
Seven years ago the attempt began to bring the three islands, St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla, into independence. This was led by the late and much lamented premier Robert Bradshaw. After years of discussion, for better or for worse, Anguilla was in 1979 hived off. The process of attaining independence then continued for the two states of St. Kitts and Nevis. Then, of course, a perceptible change was made. Nevis did not wish to enter into independence with St. Kitts. I well remember the leading members of the Nevis Reform Party, who are now Ministers in the Government, coming here to try to persuade me to support them in their claim. They were interested either in separate independence or remaining a colony like Anguilla. To the credit of the British Government&#x2014;I have to give them credit&#x2014;they were never encouraged in this secession.<lb/>
In the Caribbean democracy still prevails. At the last election the Labour Party in St. Kitts-Nevis was defeated. It is worth remembering&#x2014;this is vital to what is going on and to what may happen in the future&#x2014;that although the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party lost the election in St. Kitts-Nevis, it won the election in St. Kitts. The consequence was a coalition between the minority party in St. Kitts and the two elected members from Nevis who were committed to secession. They won the election on a programme of secession. That does not necessarily invalidate what has happened. It is very much to the credit of Her Majesty's Government that they were unwilling to allow this state to go to independence as a result of secession. They encouraged the two parties to come together and work together in the coalition to form a Government and to seek independence as one state.<lb/>
The Nevis Reformation Party was not prepared to go into independence except with an assurance that if working together became imposible it could secede. The issues were therefore resolved by an agreement to draft a constitution that would give Nevis adequate representation in the central Parliament, a local assembly and the right to secede. Thus, all Nevis's worries were assuaged. The present Opposition did not
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0190"/>
<col>363</col>
disagree on the matter of independence. In fact, they were proposing independence themselves. But they certainly disagreed with the method by which the state should go into independence. The Opposition affirmed that the present constitutional structure in which the country was going into independence was likely to make for fragmentation. Their solution, with which I would not agree, either, was to do the fragmenting now. They felt that since, in effect, Nevis was going to secede anyway, it might just as well secede now rather than have a few years in which it ruled St. Kitts and then secede.<lb/>
It is therefore important to note that while the claims of Nevis have been met in full, St. Kitts now feels cheated. That is the problem with which we are faced. I have received many representations, among them one from Brian King. It is funny that someone should ask who Brian King was, because he was a fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge. He has been a lecturer in jurisprudence at Cambridge for several years. He is a native of St. Kitts and only recently retired there. He was around here much of the time and attended most of the constitutional conferences relating to other Caribbean countries. I was therefore most amused when I was asked who Brian King was.<lb/>
Brian King was most concerned about this issue. He made many representations to me. The suggestion mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, is in fact a solution that he believes can be applied now and can work; that is to say, there should be an assembly for St. Kitts and a proper Senate in which the two islands are equally represented. This would permit a proper federation rather than a country that can be described as a federation of St. Christopher-Nevis or St. Kitts-Nevis. Let it be a federation, and, if a federation, let it be a real federation in which there is a federal House with all the powers including states assemblies in St. Kitts and Nevis and in which there is a Senate that equally represents the two states. That is the solution. It is still possible to get that solution agreed between now and 19th September, which is the date on which independence is scheduled.<lb/>
St. Kitts is the oldest of the British colonies in the West Indies. It was settled a year before Barbados. Like most of the states in the Caribbean, it has witnessed the vicissitudes of British naval history during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. It is interesting to recall not only that the most distinguished sailor in British naval history lived in the Caribbean but that Nelson also married in Nevis. The United States of America also is right to be grateful to Nevis because one of the founders of its constitution, Alexander Hamilton, was born in Nevis. If one goes to Nevis, one can find a plaque to his memory.<lb/>
On reading the constitution, I wondered whether that was the reason why Nevis was being so well favoured by the constitution. It could well be felt that Nevis is famous enough to deserve it. I am afraid, however, that this would be a terrible gamble. I have already pointed out that, although the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party lost the last election in St. Kitts-Nevis, it won the election in St. Kitts. It won four of the seven seats. If, at the next election, it wins five of the seven seats, there is a change. I presume, however, that the next election will be fought on the constitution that will involve 11 seats of which eight will be in St. Kitts.
<col>364</col>
It is still possible for the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party to win six of the eight seats. There was a time when it used to win all the seven seats. The whole issue therefore is adumbrated on something that could crumble in 1985.<lb/>
There has to be an election in 1985. It is because I personally regard it as so dangerous that I hope that Her Majesty's Government will pause at this moment, think again and perhaps confer with the present Government of St. Kitts-Nevis, and put forward the suggestions that have been made. I cannot see that either the Nevis Reform Party or the People's Action Movement could object to this arrangement. It is an arrangement under which there would be a proper federal state with an assembly in St. Kitts, an assembly in Nevis and a federal House of Assembly in which both parties would be adequately represented. But in addition there would be a Senate in which they would be equally represented so that all the worries of Nevis could well be met and the worries of St. Kitts could also be met, and we would have a proper, well-constituted state. Therefore, I sincerely hope that even at this stage&#x2014;because between May and September there is plenty of time&#x2014;we can get this change effected so that St. Kitts-Nevis can go into independence without the problems that I personally at the moment foresee.<lb/>
I have spoken for a long time on this subject, but I wish to make two further comments. When considering independence there are two matters as regards the Caribbean about which Her Majesty's Government need to concern themselves. The first is the security of the region, and the second is economics. I hope that the Government have taken cognisance of what the Eastern Caribbean is trying to do for itself by way of security. The Governments of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding whereby these parties agree to prepare a contingency plan to assist each other on request in natural emergencies; smuggling; search and rescue; immigration control; fisheries protection; offshore installation; pollution control; natural and other disasters and threats to national security. It is the general hope and belief that St. Kitts-Nevis would play a part in this as soon as she becomes independent.<lb/>
It is also the hope of all the Caribbean Governments that Her Majesty's Government would do everything possible to encourage this joint venture, not only by "words of wisdom", but in a very practical way by perhaps assistance in procuring, as I must acknowledge Her Majesty's Government have done in respect of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in helping to secure patrol boats to scour the rather long distances between one island and another. This is an area in which we ought to play, and need to be seen to play, a major role.<lb/>
As regards national security, the states have no intention of protecting themselves against foreign powers. They cannot do so&#x2014;it would be practically impossible for them to do so. But they certainly feel that they could handle threats from marauders who endanger their immediate economic well-being. For this reason I hope that the Minister will inform the House whether Her Majesty's Government are prepared to keep a weathered eye on the area by way
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0191"/>
<col>365</col>
of supporting whatever these newly emergent states can do for themselves as a measure of security. This is something that we can do and it is something that we must do.<lb/>
As regards economics, the prime economic factor in St. Kitts-Nevis is sugar. There is a secondary industry which is very much in its infancy in those islands&#x2014;namely, tourism. The Government there intend to pay attention to this matter. However, at this stage it will be of interest to point out that the exchange rate of the pound sterling to the dollar so adversely affects the whole economy of St. Kitts-Nevis that for sugar alone I am informed that the Government of this new state will be losing in the coming year something in the vicinity of 12 million to 13 million East Caribbean dollars just because of the way in which the exchange rate is running at present. As regards tourism, St. Kitts-Nevis has begun a drive towards increasing the number of tourists arriving in the country. I wish to deal with another aspect of that matter later. However, first I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to another matter.<lb/>
It is customary that Her Majesty's Government give to a newly independent country a golden handshake. From reports that I have been receiving from different territories in the Caribbean this gift has come to be regarded as neither golden nor a handshake. It is not golden, not because they are pressing for a greater amount&#x2014;not that I would object if the amount was greater&#x2014;but because it has suddenly dawned on these states, who thought that they were being given, in most cases, a grant and a loan together totalling &#x00A3;10 million for the economic improvement of their state, that there is nothing of the sort. So far as I have been able to gather, what in fact really happens is that after independence the Foreign and Commonwealth Office aid department seeks to set up a <i>quasi</i>-colonial relationship. It administers the golden handshake in a series of driblets, small portions of monies which are carefully checked and monitored as if the state were still a crown colony. The state is never really able to undertake any major projects which in its own view are of absolute necessity, but there is a system of patching up. The independent state is being kept ever on a lead. I do not think that that is the concept of a golden handshake.<lb/>
I feel&#x2014;and I know that the people of the Caribbean feel&#x2014;that it is a mechanism to keep the state in economic colonial relationship with this country. That is exactly what the states would wish to get away from on becoming independent. I very much hope that Her Majesty's Government can make a firm commitment to giving the economic aid for the advancement of St. Kitts-Nevis in a way which, in the view of the new state, would better serve its economic interests. I have recently had some complaints from Antigua about the way in which it is now being treated. I hope that this will not be repeated in the case of St. Kitts.<lb/>
It seems to me curious that although Her Majesty's Government are prepared to support the wider integration of the Caribbean islands, they have been prepared to deny the islands the use of British West Indian Airways as their regional carrier. One of the planks in this integration is air linkage because we are talking about a lot of little islands. Throughout it was
<col>366</col>
hoped&#x2014;indeed, it was almost taken for granted&#x2014;that the introduction of a regional carrier would enable these territories to advance the integration. It has been blocked time and time again through the British Government insisting on British Airways being the carrier rather than British West Indian Airways.<lb/>
For some time now the Eastern Caribbean islands have thought it in their best interest to have a regional carrier and have turned to their own British West Indian Airways to be that carrier. I for one can see no reason why Her Majesty's Government should continue to stand in the way of the development of the area in this way in order to provide a few seats for British Airways.<lb/>
These independent states have repeatedly approached Her Majesty's Government with, as I said before, the intention of assisting this progress of integration and the economy of these states, which to such a large extent depend on tourism. In fact, I hope that Her Majesty's Government will reconsider their attitude in this particular matter, because I know that St. Kitts-Nevis has had overtures made about British West Indian Airways being designated as its carrier. I hope it will not have the same experience as Antigua and St. Lucia have had when they have tried to same thing.<lb/>
Finally, may I again suggest that the Government of St. Kitts-Nevis be approached with a suggestion that the constitution be amended in the way that has been suggested. I know that it will increase the cost of government. But I personally think that it would be more sensible to have better government at an increased cost; it would certainly be less dangerous. I am well aware of the fact that we cannot dictate to the St. Kitts Government, but I still think that between now and the time for independence we can use such influence as we have to suggest to them a way in which this present problem can be resolved.<lb/>
It is rather ironic that, having been so critical of the organisation of the Caribbean, I should find myself unable to give the wholehearted support that I should have liked to give to this order. At least this order has not furthered the break-up of the area. But the reason I have to be as critical as I am is that I really think that we are laying the seeds for a further break-up. I hope that the Government will reconsider their position in this matter.</membercontribution></p>

My own particular link with this Associated State dates from the 1960s, when, as I have mentioned to your Lordships' House before, I was sent with Sir Nigel Fisher&#x2014;because of our joint knowledge of this area and of the people concerned&#x2014;to try to prevent the secession of Anguilla from this Associated State of St. Kitts-Nevis and Anguilla. The process, during which we negotiated with mini-shuttle diplomacy on aeroplanes between Anguilla and St. Kitts, was one which I shall remember for the rest of my life.<lb/>
The position is that there is one justification for the secession of Anguilla which certainly does not exist in the case of Nevis. I want to state that from the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0192"/>
<col>367</col>
beginning. The Anguillans are some scores of miles away across the Caribbean ocean. Their forefathers were mainly pirates who landed in the area and intermarried with the black people whom we had brought there from Africa. They did not have many links in a very real sense with the island of St. Kitts, which is a sugar island and, as my noble friend Lord Pitt has indicated, a one crop economy. It was almost an accident of history&#x2014;a grouping by former British Governments of the three islands together&#x2014;that made it into one state&#x2014;St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla.<lb/>
Despite our efforts&#x2014;Sir Nigel Fisher's, mine and those of successive Ministers&#x2014;in the end we have had to accept the secession of Anguilla. But a constitution which, as my noble friend says, sows seeds for this to happen to Nevis is only regrettable. In contrast with Anguilla, Nevis is just across the road from St. Kitts. It is almost physically linked to St. Kitts. There is there a community of interest which did not exist in Anguilla. It is sad that the precedent of Anguilla is, in a sense, being seized on by the people of Nevis when the comparison is illegitimate. That is the first point I want to make and, therefore, I join with my noble friends Lord Cledwyn and Lord Pitt in saying that there is a great deal to worry about in the provisions for the possible secession of Nevis.<lb/>
The tragedy is that in a way this would not have happened if it had all come to fruition a few years ago. At that time the giants of St. Kitts' history were still alive. One was Robert Bradshaw, who had a long history in the Caribbean, not just as Premier of St. Kitts but also as the Finance Minister in the defunct Federation of the West Indies in the 1960s. He towered above all his contemporaries. Sadly, he was to die two or three years ago, and one of the saddest days of my life was to represent Her Majesty's Government at his funeral. I felt that the end of an era was all around me.<lb/>
Then very quickly afterwards the man who had joined with him to do so much for St. Kitts&#x2014;Paul Southwell&#x2014;also died. He was not originally a Kittician, but an adopted Kittician, as my noble friend confirms. I thought that he would carry the day and see the island through to independence with proper safeguards for the future, but sadly, he too died very shortly afterwards. With great respect to the Ministers and people who are in power today, they are not the giants that were Robert Bradshaw and Paul Southwell. If those two had been alive, we would not have had an independence conference of this kind with so much disagreement and with the seeds of danger so clearly sown. They would have towered above it, and I am sure would have rallied the people of both islands to a much more satisfactory continuation of the link between them.<lb/>
So I approach this with mixed feelings. I shall not repeat the arguments that my noble friend Lord Cledwyn has put from the Opposition Front Bench as to the dangers of the detail in that constitution. But there is one other thing that needs to be said on this day when we are bidding goodbye to most of our former colonies of the Caribbean. It is that our record in the area is not all that good. It is not something I go around the world praising and taking credit for. In the first place, by our act, we scuttled out of the Caribbean much too soon. We allowed fragmentation to occur.
<col>368</col>
We encouraged unnecessarily the idea of early independence for states which are now too small to make strong headway in the currents of world economics. I would have said to hell with the Committee of the United Nations and hung on to our role a good deal longer. We had a job to do there which was to encourage these islands to work more closely together in a federation after the first one failed, and to unite their economies in a way that we had never successfully done when their links were always with us and never with each other as colonies.<lb/>
Secondly, we never did it right in terms of economics either, as my noble friend has hinted. In the 1960s we managed to get the Canadian and American Governments to join with the British Government in sponsoring a study by Dr. Carleen O'Loughlin of the University of the West Indies on the cost of bringing these islands to real economic take-off point. My Lords, it was peanuts. A few million pounds at that time would have taken these islands forward to a real springboard for independence. Instead, all the initiative was left. The British Government said, "Oh, it's not our responsibility. We're just going to get out. We've had enough". The result was that we never tried to get the Canadian and American Governments to join with us in executing the recommendation of Dr. Carleen O'Loughlin's study, which would have started these states off on a basis of real economic viability. It is to our shame&#x2014;one I shall live with for the rest of my life&#x2014;that we got it wrong in the Caribbean, and we should not be going around at all proud of our record.<lb/>
Now I come to the future. The Government have at least some chance of making up for some of this in the golden handshake that my noble friend mentioned. First, we have to try to help diversify the economy of the main island of St. Kitts. If we can do so and get it off sugar, it will be for the good of those people there. Secondly, when it comes to tourism, St. Kitts has one of the most beautiful beaches in the Caribbean in the southern part of the island. It desperately needs funds to launch it as a major tourist resort now that the airport has been upgraded to take really big jets. The possibilities are great. We should see that some of the money is used to give that island a second chance of economic viability.<lb/>
Finally, in that list of possible shopping for a golden handshake why not see that there is a physical link of some kind with the island of Nevis, just across the road? That would be one way of stopping the talk in Nevis of secession. It would be one way of making them realise that the British Government strongly feel that this would be a mistake. How big a mistake? It is a few thousand people wanting to become an independent nation in the world. Frankly, it is ridiculous. Although we can fly the flag of self-determination we still have a role in the world of offering advice.<lb/>
The advice that ought to go out from this House today is that we do not believe that it would be right for Nevis to fragment even further the Caribbean with all the dangers that that can hold, with all the continual strife it will make in the future between these two virtually linked islands&#x2014;virtually physically linked as they are&#x2014;and we ought to be saying to them that part of the golden handshake that we hope to be able to offer will strengthen and not weaken those links which are for the good of both the islands and both the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0193"/>
<col>369</col>
peoples. It is not a happy day for those of us who are interested in the Caribbean and know and love all of its peoples. We have to wish an Associated State luck, good fortune on independence, but on this occasion it is with mixed feelings that we do so.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01337"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful, and I am sure that the Government and people of St. Kitts-Nevis will be, that three noble Lords have felt sufficiently moved by this order to speak on it in your Lordships' House today. I must, however, begin my reply with a general observation. St. Kitts and Nevis have had internal self-government since 1967. That is, for over 15 years. In this time Governments of two political persuasions have ruled both conscientiously and well. That is not supposed to sound patronising. It is something that I feel.<lb/>
It has been consistent Government policy over many years to bring people to full independence in accordance with the United Nations Charter when both they and their Governments request it. Much of this debate this evening has centred upon Nevis secession&#x2014;not surprisingly. It was brought out by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, and his noble friend Lord Pitt. Since 1975, attempts to bring St. Kitts-Nevis to independence have foundered because Nevis distrusted the St. Kitts Labour Government, which, as we have heard, was in power for 30 years up to 1980 and wanted a separate status. Talks in 1979 broke down when Nevis rejected this Government's proposals for independence to be followed after 18 months by a binding referendum on secession.<lb/>
Relations between the two islands have, I am glad to say, improved greatly since 1980. Agreement has been reached&#x2014;and the House should not underestimate this&#x2014;for a secesssion clause in the constitution which requires, as I said in my opening speech, a two-thirds majority in the Nevis Assembly, referendum approved by not less than two-thirds of the electorate, and independent international monitoring of it. The time is now opportune to bring St. Kitts-Nevis to independence as a unitary state.<lb/>
In essence I think that the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, who referred to himself as an islander&#x2014;recently I have been considering other sorts of islanders, those made by Britten Norman, but we will let that pass&#x2014;asked why St. Kitts had not got its own secession arrangements. It is really a question of where the pressure has come from over the years. It has always been Nevis that has sought autonomy from St. Kitts and not the other way round. There has been no adverse reaction from the people of St. Kitts to the present proposals. Perhaps most importantly of all, and finally, it is for the Government and people of St. Kitts-Nevis to work out constitutional arrangements that suit them. We are satisfied that this is what they have done, and that they have had ample opportunity to do it.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pitt, asked whether we are satisfied with the security arrangements in the Eastern Caribbean generally. As the noble Lord well knows, associated statehood was conceived as a stepping stone to full independence. All the political parties of St. Kitts are in favour of independence. This new
<col>370</col>
status will enable St. Kitts-Nevis to obtain aid and technical assistance from a wider range of international sources.<lb/>
In passing, I may say to the noble Lord, Lord Northfield, that this aid package&#x2014;or what he rather unfortunately, I thought, referred to as a golden handshake; it is not intended to be that at all, for to my mind at least that has totally different connotations&#x2014;is of course still a matter for discussion. This discussion will go on between this Government and the St. Kitts-Nevis Government for some considerable time to come, but of course there is no point in pursuing that unless the House passes this order this evening.<lb/>
This new status will enable St. Kitts-Nevis to obtain aid and technical assistance from a wider range of international sources. It will permit an even wider participation in regional fora, such as the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. Contrary to the impression that the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, may have left the House with, Her Majesty's Government greatly welcome recent efforts of Easten Caribbean States to co-operate in mutual security arrangements, and look forward to assisting with training and equipment and in whatever way would appear to be appropriate at the time.<lb/>
I am quite satisfied that enough time was available for public discussion and debate on this proposed termination order. The question of independence for St. Kitts-Nevis is far from new. Moves were first made to organise a constitutional conference in 1979 by the Labour Party Government led by Mr. Leigh Moore. Informal talks were held, but they stumbled over the issue of Nevis, whose representatives were insisting on a referendum being held before independence. That was overridden and it was agreed that St. Kitts and Nevis should move towards independence as a unitary state as early as possible in 1980. The proposal finally came to grief when Mr. Moore's party lost the general election held in February 1980 and he went into opposition. His subsequent objection to proposals for independence to go ahead under the Government of Dr. Kennedy Simmons seemed, therefore, to be based on somewhat political reasons. The independence debate has been in progress for several years and all the points at issue have been aired many times.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, asked me when were the Government in this country saitsfied that there was political agreement on the subject of independence in St. Kitts and Nevis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01338"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I asked when the Government were satisfied that there was ample evidence that the people of St. Kitts were in favour of this constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01339"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: I am grateful to the noble Lord for that clarification, my Lords. When the constitutional conference was held the fact that both parties were there represented was an indication of this. However, in my book, the real acceptance, or perception of the acceptance, came in the debate in the legislative assembly in March this year, when both parties spoke and there was a vote at the end.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pitt of Hampstead, asked why was the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis not asked to hold an election or referendum.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0194"/>
<col>371</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01340"><member>Lord Pitt of Hampstead</member><membercontribution>: I did not ask the noble Lord that, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01341"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: I apologise, my Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Pitt, gave me the impression that he had asked, but since he has now confirmed that he did not, I shall not answer.<lb/>
The one thing that the noble Lord, Lord Pitt, did ask about was the exchange rate. It is a factor that because the Eastern Caribbean dollar is a currency on its own and is not, as I understand it, linked to any other national currency, it will suffer the vagaries of the exchange rate, particularly in relation to the pound, which has been doing some rather strange things lately for no apparent reason, at least to me, though I am sure that many noble Lords will know exactly why. It is a matter for the Eastern Caribbean states to decide whether this should continue or whether the Eastern Caribbean dollar should be linked to the United States dollar, to the pound, to the Japanese yen, or to anything else that they may like to discuss.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Pitt, also commented about the local airline, BWIA, British West Indian Airways. The question of this airline's rights are a matter for discussion between the St. Kitts and Nevis Government and Her Majesty's Government after independence. I should point out that BWIA is the Trinidad national carrier and is not, as yet, a regional carrier, because it has no regional ownership.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01342"><member>Lord Pitt of Hampstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is the whole point that has angered me. British West Indian Airways is owned by the Trinidad Government, but every West Indian Government except Jamaica has so far asked that British West Indian Airways should be made the regional carrier and on each occasion the British Government&#x2014;because British Airways objected&#x2014;has obstructed that. It is no use any British Minister saying that it is a matter for discussion between this Government or that Government. In effect, when the Government come to make a decision they obstruct. That is what has been happening with British West Indian Airways.<lb/>
I wish to go further, if your Lordships will permit me, to say that British West Indian Airways was once a subsidiary of British Overseas Airways Corporation. When the federation broke up, Trinidad was the only country that had money and it bought British West Indian Airways. It was always intended to be the carrier for the whole area and the only reason it is not the carrier for the whole area is because the British Government have always backed British Airways in obstructing it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01343"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a matter of opinion which I do not particularly want to get drawn into at this moment.<lb/>
The arrangements for the independence settlement will be discussed very soon and no doubt the St. Kitts and Nevis Government will put forward arguments advanced by the noble Lord. We must not forget that British aid is British money and must be properly accounted for, subject, of course, to the annual parliamentary appropriations.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Northfield, asked me, and talked in quite a piece of his speech, about the history
<col>372</col>
of our relationship with the Caribbean as a geographical area. I assure him that we recognise our continuing responsibility for assisting the economic development of the Commonwealth Caribbean. We have not neglected and are not neglecting our responsibilities. British aid to the Caribbean is currently running at &#x00A3;25 million a year, which is a substantial sum by any standards.<lb/>
In conclusion, this debate is about something which is basically simple, and that is whether the democratically expressed human rights of a group of islanders should be denied expression by the will of this Parliament, to which, quite evidently, the answer must be, No. It is no for perhaps a slightly different reason. In his opening speech to the constitutional conference in London, Mr. Leigh Moore, the Leader of the Opposition, stated:
<quote>"I wish to affirm that the people are not against independence".</quote>
I hope that your Lordships' House will not be either.<lb/>

<section>
<title>Lotteries (Amendment) Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01344">5.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01345"><member>Lord Irving of Dartford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is to correct an anomaly identified in paragraph 12.201 of the final report of the Royal Commission on Gambling (Cmnd. 7200) in 1978. The anomaly is prejudicing the export of material by certain firms in our domestic printing industry which specialise in the production of tickets for lotteries conducted wholly abroad.<lb/>
There can be no justification for United Kingdom legislation penalising our export industry. This is not merely a theoretical fetter on export effort and potential, but can be illustrated by one undertaking's performance. Since 1973 its export turnover, which recently rose to 41 per cent. of the whole, has totalled &#x00A3;10,783,000, and in 1981 it was &#x00A3;2,745,000, to 22 overseas countries, giving employment to 300 people. These achievements have been secured in the face of the strongest overseas competition and despite the effects of the recession.<lb/>
The anomaly arises in Section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 and can be traced back through Section 42(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 to the Lotteries Act 1823, when, no doubt, printing exports were of much less consequence than they are today. The final report of the Royal Commission in 1978 could hardly have put the case for altering the anomaly more forcefully and succinctly. In paragraph 12.200 it says:
<quote>"We received formal evidence from Kenrick and Jefferson, an old-established firm specialising in security printing, complaining that section 42(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 (which has become section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) of the 1976 Act), as at present interpreted, has prevented them from exporting lottery tickets. They say in their evidence: 'Being an ethical house we obey the law. At the same time we know that overseas lottery tickets are printed in the United Kingdom, and subsequently exported.' Far from suggesting that the offenders be made to toe the line, it is our contention that the law should be changed in order that others may legally participate in this trade".</quote>
In the following paragraph it says:
<quote>"Our terms of reference are concerned with gambling in Britain,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0195"/>
<col>373</col>
not with unnecessary hindrance to Britain's export trade, Nevertheless, it does seem absurd that a law which has remained unchanged since 1823 should be able to have this effect. We hope that the hindrances referred to by Kenrick and Jefferson will be quickly removed."</quote>
Moreover, the reality of the threat to the printing undertakings of this country is shown by the representations made by their overseas printing competitors to our industry's potential customers abroad, alleging that those undertakings are in breach of United Kingdom law in making printed lottery supplies. A letter dated 23rd June 1982, addressed to the Finnish Embassy commercial department from the European representative of an American printing company, actually threatened that if the British printing company got the order they, an American company, would initiate a prosecution in this country against them. Your Lordships may think that this is an impertinence, but, whatever it is, it certainly is not a situation which should be allowed to continue. There is also no virtue in our police authorities being required to investigate complaints of this nature, as, indeed, has occurred.<lb/>
It can be added that the present anomaly in Section 2 of the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 is contrary to the Treaty of Rome as a (and I quote from the treaty),
<quote>"disguised restriction on trade between Member States".</quote>
Article 36 of the treaty is in the following terms:
<quote>"The provisions of Articles 30 to 34 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historic or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial and commercial property. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not, however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States".</quote>
The terms of the Bill have been limited strictly to curing the acknowledged anomaly. The source of the problem is in the opening words of Section 2(1):
<quote>"Subject to the provisions of this section, every person who in connection with any lottery promoted or proposed to be promoted either in Great Britain or elsewhere"&#x2014;</quote>
and those are the two offending words&#x2014;
<quote>"shall be guilty of an offence".</quote>
Put shortly, the new subsection (4) proposed in the Bill removes the offences of printing and selling material to the promoters of any lottery conducted wholly outside Great Britain. It does not, for example, tamper with the offence of distributing in Great Britain tickets or chances in a lottery promoted outside Great Britain (such as the Irish Hospitals Sweep, for which tickets cannot be sold here).<lb/>
It has been made clear that the Department of Industry and the Home Office are fully in sympathy with the modest purpose of the Bill, and drafting of the Bill has been undertaken in consultation with their officials. If any point of drafting arises, sympathetic consideration will be given to it, but it is hoped that the preliminary consultations have ensured that no amendment should be necessary. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, chairman of the Gambling Board, has been good enough to say that, although it is not the responsibility of his board, the board finds no problems in this amendment. What is plain is that, for the safeguard of the export potential of this sector of
<col>374</col>
our printing industry, this alteration of the law is urgently needed. It should not await the uncertainty of the timetable for any future Government measure in this field.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01346">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time&#x2014;(<i>Lord Irving of Dartford.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01347">5.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01348"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Irving of Dartford, for having brought this short Bill before the House and for having explained its purpose so clearly. Your Lordships will have realised that something must have been overlooked by Parliament when it came to deal with the legislation on lotteries. Because I felt that it was incumbent upon me to do a little research work to see how this error occurred, I found something which may lighten your Lordships' hearts on a day when very serious announcements have been made.<lb/>
The fact of the matter is that the 1976 Act was a consolidation Act. It followed upon 1975, when, of course, it was decided that local authorities should have a part to play in lotteries. Being a consolidation Bill coming before your Lordships' House and another place, it was not suitable for any amendments to be thought of; so one had to go back to the 1963 Act, and one finds that that, too, was a consolidation Act and therefore not appropriate for amendment.<lb/>
In the history of this matter, the preceding Act was the 1934 Act. I take your Lordships back, with some sense of amusement, to a time when in your Lordships' House the very clause of which my noble friend Lord Irving of Dartford has been speaking was discussed. In 1934&#x2014;and I read from the <i>Official Report</i> of your Lordships' proceedings of 31st May of that year&#x2014;the following interesting discussion took place at the Committee stage of the Betting and Lotteries Bill then before your Lordships' House. It was the Duke of Atholl who started a discussion upon this and an allied clause, and perhaps I may read it:
<quote>"Before this clause is passed I should be glad if the noble Marquess in charge of the Bill"&#x2014;</quote>
it was the Marquess of Londonderry, in fact&#x2014;
<quote>"would describe to the House what he means by a lottery as the words in the clause, 'all lotteries', seem to me to be rather sweeping. It is just as well that the public should know not ony what constitutes an offence such as we find in this Bill, but also what constitutes a lottery. My reason for asking this is that ignorance on this point may lead virtuous people astray and involve them in a heavy fine and imprisonment. For instance, all members of your Lordships' House have received a notice of a ballot, of which apparently the Lord Chancellor is the promoter. They have been asked to subscribe 7s. 6d. each for the chance of obtaining a prize in the shape of a seat for the ceremony of Trooping the Colour on June 4. All the money subscribed is to go to expenses. The money is to be enclosed with the application, and in no circumstances will the money be returned, although it is not known whether the amount received will be sufficient to pay for the erection of the stands or whether it will be in excess of the amount required. Perhaps the noble Marquess will tell me in what way this so-called ballot differs from a lottery. If it does not, I feel that I should warn a certain high dignitary of this House as well as the Secretary to the War Office that lotteries promoted for good or national objects in this country are not always looked upon favourably by the authorities."</quote>
The Marquess of Londonderry&#x2014;and I say this with great respect to the noble Marquess&#x2014;was, I think, caught on the wrong foot and, in his reply (with which I shall not trouble your Lordships) he endeavoured to throw the burden upon the poor Duke of Atholl by
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0196"/>
<col>375</col>
asking him, since he had raised the question, to define for himself what a lottery was; otherwise apparently to the noble Marquess it was somewhat of an impertinence to raise the matter in Committee in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
In fact, this very anomaly, as your Lordships may feel it to be, which prevents British printers from printing lottery tickets for a lottery promoted wholly abroad, was again dealt with by the Duke of Atholl, to whom one really feels one owes a debt at this moment. He raised this very point&#x2014;I am now reading from col. 719 of the same day, 31st May 1934&#x2014;and said:
<quote>"Supposing there was a sweepstake in some foreign country: there is no reason why our printers should not print the tickets so long as they are honest people and it is not against the law in this country. I am not quite certain whether it is covered in a later Amendment I am going to press".</quote>
Then Viscount Bertie of Thame said:
<quote>"May I ask the noble Marquess whether foreign premium bonds which might be printed in this country for foreign Governments would not come under this Bill?"</quote>
The Marquess of Londonderry replied that he would make inquiries; he was again extremely helpful. All my researches after that do not reveal the result of those inquiries. Apparently the noble Duke who raised the matter originally was persuaded, possibly by some other greater matter of state, not to raise it again.<lb/>
So that is the history of the matter which is before your Lordships today. It comes in this very innocent but very proper Bill which is introduced in order to try to amend something which was discussed in 1934 but which, unfortunately, was not dealt with. Perhaps it is an encouragement to all members of your Lordships' House that once they have seized upon a good point they will never leave it, whatever the Minister tries to do, to you.<lb/>
The final thing I want to do is this. My noble friend Lord Irving of Dartford referred to the way in which British printers were prevented from getting perfectly legitimate orders by reason of the present state of the law. He referred to a letter which was sent, and only because I find it to be the unacceptable face of capitalism do I intend to read the letter; then I will trouble your Lordships no longer. It illustrates quite definitely how unfairly some commercial firms work within this country in order to try to rob our own people of very proper contracts even though our law seems to be somewhat defective in the matter. I should like to read to your Lordships this letter, which comes from a Mr. E. Kelly and is dated 23rd June 1982. It is written from Warwickshire, and is addressed to the Finnish Embassy, Commercial Section. It reads as follows:
<quote>Dear Sir.</quote>
<quote>"I understand that arrangements have recently been concluded between your Government and Norton &amp; Wright Ltd. of Leeds, whereby that Company will supply tickets for use in your State lottery.</quote>
<quote>"It is my duty to bring to your attention the fact that it is totally unlawful for a British company to print and export lottery tickets for use abroad (Section 2 (1)(a) of the Lotteries &amp; Amusements Act 1976) and it seems totally incongruous that a Government such as your own would countenance flouting British law in such a way.</quote>
<quote>"As the European representative of a major print group in the United States of America (from where export is perfectly lawful) I have taken very detailed legal advice and I can assure you that the prohibition on exports from Britain is quite specific and that Norton's activities are open to the deepest question.</quote>
<quote>"To substantiate my point, I enclose a letter from the Department
<col>376</col>
of Trade, the contents of which were made known to Norton &amp; Wright over a year ago. I thus give you warning to look into this matter before my company initiates a prosecution against Nortons&#x2014;the result of which may well prove extremely embarrassing for your Government&#x2014;both practically and politically.</quote>
<quote>"My company will be represented at the forthcoming Lottery Congress in Lausanne and will be delighted to suggest alternative and more legal arrangements for your Lottery's consideration".</quote>
The gentleman signs himself "Yours faithfully".<lb/>
We have an opportunity this afternoon, as a result of my noble friend's Bill, to rectify this matter and to see that such letters can no longer be sent to deprive lawful and respectable British firms of the business which they undertake, in many cases most efficiently. It is therefore with some delight that I support my noble friend's Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01349"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord, Lord Irving, has somewhat pre-empted what he feels the Government might say about his Bill; but I should like to congratulate him on the lucid way in which he has explained the points that he wanted to make about this Bill.<lb/>
As he described, and as the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, also pointed out, it is, at present, an offence under the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 to print any ticket for use in a lottery promoted or proposed to be promoted except as provided for by that Act. Lotteries promoted outside Great Britain are, as provided by the Act, unlawful. As we know, this is not a new restriction; it has existed for many years, at least since the early nineteenth century. The purpose of the Bill before your Lordships is to remove that restriction by amending the 1976 Act so as to enable printers in Great Britain to print and supply lottery tickets and associated lottery material such as advertisements, for use in the promotion of a lottery wholly outside Great Britain, such as a foreign national lottery, which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, referred to.<lb/>
Lottery legislation is framed so as to control and regulate lotteries conducted in Great Britain and to prevent the importation of advertising material, notices or tickets relating to foreign lotteries over which we would have no control. The legislation is there to protect the public from buying tickets in lotteries where there can be no assurance that such lotteries are properly run. The restriction on the export of lottery tickets no doubt made sense when such export was perhaps simply the first stage before reimporting the tickets to this country as spurious foreign lottery tickets. But such a restriction no longer seems appropriate when many countries run large national lotteries of their own&#x2014;lotteries, moreover, which require specialised printing of a kind which British companies can provide.<lb/>
The existing legislation was never intended to prevent or restrict legitimate commercial export activities, but it is important that any relaxation in the law, such as that proposed in the Bill, should not undermine the controls which protect the public. In particular, we must be satisfied that there are adequate safeguards to ensure that tickets for foreign lotteries are not distributed in Great Britain or exported and then imported.<lb/>
With these considerations firmly in mind, the Government support the principle of this modest Bill.
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0197"/>
<col>377</col>
The Royal Commission on Gambling, who noted that the point was outside their terms of reference, nevertheless recommended that this change should be made and we had noted it for inclusion in more general legislation on lotteries. The Gaming Board, whom we have consulted, also have no objection to the proposals in the Bill.<lb/>
There are some amendments we should like to see made to the Bill, both of a technical nature and to ensure that there is no loophole which permits the distribution in Great Britain of lottery material intended for export. These would in no way affect the main purpose of the Bill, which the noble Lord, Lord Irving, has described. If your Lordships give this Bill a Second Reading, it would be our intention to offer the noble Lord, Lord Irving, amendments which he might move at the Committee stage and such other assistance as might prove necessary.<lb/>
I said that this was a modest Bill but it is one which could serve a useful purpose. It would open up a potential export market for some sectors of the British printing industry and that is something I am sure your Lordships' House would wish to encourage. My Lords, in conclusion I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Irving, on introducing this Bill. I do not, of course, know what the rest of the week holds in store for us and I hope the noble Lord will not be too despondent over the timing of the Second Reading of this Bill in view of the announcements that have been made today; but I can reaffirm with a certain measure of conviction that if he were to introduce it again later in the summer, the Government (as they are now) will support the principle behind the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01350"><member>Lord Irving of Dartford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Lord and the Government for their very sympathetic support for the Bill. I should be only too glad to entertain the amendments that are suggested. I am afraid that I cannot make the same remark that the noble Lord, Lord Wigoder, made earlier this afternoon in another Second Reading debate. I cannot hope that the Government might find time for the Bill before the end of this Parliament, but I will certainly be back with it in the next Parliament.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Diseases of Fish Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01361">6.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01362"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. I must declare an interest, in that I am a fish farmer of, I suppose by English standards, fairly considerable size, and furthermore&#x2014;and this is a point which should be made before speaking about this Bill&#x2014;I am a fish farmer who produces fish entirely for food. In other words, fish that leave my farm leave it dead. Your Lordships will have realised that there are certain prohibitions and restraints on fish farmers within this Bill which are a little stronger than they were in the 1937 Act, but they will bear a little heavier on those who sell fish for stocking rivers or lakes than on those, such as myself, who as I said, sell entirely for the table.<lb/>
We have often spoken of fish farming in your Lordships' Chamber and I myself have once or twice before. Lady Emmet of Amberley used to keep the subject before our eyes and perhaps we should have got further by now if she were still with us to do so. The subject is of very considerable importance, and it completely belies the small size of the Bill. In I think 1980 the Government produced a consultative paper which had various paragraphs on fish farming and fish diseases. It bore very heavily on the importance and the danger of fish diseases, in view of the fact that fish farming has grown so very quickly of recent years, and in relation to this Bill we must consider just how quickly this emergent industry, if I may call it that, has grown. It is not a large industry now, but I started fish farming about 14 years ago and I believe that in this country there were then some 20 or so fish farmers of any size at all. Now I am told that there are approximately 470. This morning, I motored up from my home just south of Salisbury and passed four fish farms. Fourteen years ago, after leaving my own fish farm I never saw another fish until I got to Billingsgate.<lb/>
As I said, this subject is important, and it is also important to look a little at the way in which fish farming has grown. There are a large number of fish farms which take the process from the very start to the finish. They take the eggs from the female fish, fertilise them and grow them on until eventually they go to market in one way or another, either alive or dead. But there is another very large section of the industry which has emulated the fatstock industry and divided itself up. There are farmers who grow eggs and sell them on and others who take the fish as far as the fingerling size, or even larger. One hears of fish that are almost mature being sold just to be finished, as a bullock might be finished off in a yard in the eastern counties, perhaps having been born on the borders of Wales. This means that fish are moving across the country in tanks on lorries or trailers almost every day. As well as passing fish farms on the way up from
<col>380</col>
Salisbury, nearly always I pass a tanker containing, I believe, trout.<lb/>
Another development of which the Bill before your Lordships takes cognisance is that over this span of 14 years, or a little longer, fish farming, which used to involve almost entirely trout, now involves all sorts of fish. As your Lordships know, the salmon farming industry off the coast of Scotland has become very important, and of some size. One sees farmed salmon advertised in many fishmongers in London and elsewhere. The industry is still growing. People are beginning to farm eels, using the warm waters of power stations, or similar situations. Halibut and turbot are farmed. Shellfish are farmed, too, and have to be taken notice of very particularly. Even such species as crayfish are, I am told, farmed. Whether this is a successful venture I do not know.<lb/>
If noble Lords consider this growth and the diversity which has emerged, it is not surprising that the fish farming industry has somewhat outgrown the Diseases of Fish Act 1937 and also the Shellfish Act 1967. It would be remarkable if it had not. We should be aware of the risk that this Bill tries to obviate, so far as possible. The risk is that we shall move disease rapidly from one fish farm to another, or from one catchment area to another, or from one marine area to another and damage not only our fish farms but, very important indeed, our natural and still very prolific waters.<lb/>
Your Lordships know, because it has been written about recently, that in this country there is an enormous and growing population of anglers. It would be ironic as well as a catastrophe if fish farmers, who to a large extent provide fish to give pleasure to anglers, at the same time provided them with the necessary disease to kill what fish they have, plus the new influx, and to destroy their fisheries. We should therefore be very grateful to Mr. Corrie in another place for choosing to promote a Bill dealing with this subject.<lb/>
As I have already said, the Bill updates and reinforces the Diseases of Fish Act 1937 and makes a small but important addition to the Shellfish Act 1967. It does this in a variety of ways. The Bill enables the Minister to act more quickly in times of emergency, and with a little more force. In Clause 1 there is a slight relaxation of the 1937 Act rules. Salmonids will now, if the Minister sees fit to issue a licence, be allowed to come into Scotland from Northern Ireland. I believe that this is of importance to fish farmers in Northern Ireland. I believe also that their own laws on fish farming and general health and hygiene are very strict.<lb/>
The next point that I should like to bring before your Lordships relates to speed. When the Minister wishes to designate an infected area he will be able to do so on the suspicion of disease. This will speed things up quite considerably. In the fish farming climate in which we now live, this is very important indeed. One might say that at the moment there is no disease which requires to be dealt with speedily, but that would be wrong. There are a few diseases which need to be dealt with quickly in order to prevent them getting a hold and causing real difficulty. But what must always be at the back of our minds when we are talking about the Bill are the diseases which might come to this country. Two are now rife on the Continent, particularly in
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0199"/>
<col>381</col>
France. For obvious reasons, they are given initials. The first one is VHS&#x2014;viral haemorrhagic septicaemia. The next is IHN, which is infectious haematopoetic necrosis or something of that sort. The names are enough to frighten any honest fish farmer. I was speaking a few days ago to a very clever professor from Idaho who has studied fish all his life. He said that we can well do without both of these diseases and that we ought not to spend too much time talking about them; the best thing to do would be to take some action.<lb/>
The Bill also strengthens the controls which the Minister can apply within a designated area. It alters the rules to the extent that, as well as not allowing live eggs or fish to leave the farm, it prevents them from coming into the farm, though foodstuff is allowed to come into the farm. Nobody expects the fish to starve. The Bill also contains the all-important provision extending these controls to cover farmed sea fish. It makes provision for cages in the sea. Both freshwater and seawater fish will be covered by the same rules.<lb/>
The Bill alters the timing of the preliminary period during which a fish farmer is told that he must stop the movement of fish. At present, a period of 16 days is applied, and it is reapplied <i>ad infinitum</i>, if necessary. The period contained in the Bill is longer in order to give the scientists more time to work on the problem. The period is 30 days and it can be extended to 60 days. After 60 days, however, instead of continuing to renew the period, the area has to be designated. Action of another kind has to be taken.<lb/>
My next point relates to notifiable diseases. Many new diseases are appearing. This underlines the fact that speed is important. Furthermore, some diseases which long ago frightened us very much are not now considered to be important. Therefore the Minister has been given the power by Negative Resolution to add to and substract from the list of notifiable diseases. The list would only get longer and longer, and in the end it would produce a ridiculous situation. Many practical people agree that certain diseases should come off the list and should no longer be a burden and a worry.<lb/>
It has been suggested that there should be something in this Bill about the importation of dead fish, which can, of course, carry disease. I am assured that this matter is perfectly adequately covered in the Animal Health Act 1981, and it was said in another place by Mr. Buchanan-Smith that he would be perfectly prepared to use that Act if it were thought necessary to do so.<lb/>
All these new enabling powers are of importance, but perhaps central to the whole question are the innovations which are included in Clauses 7 to 9. Here we have fresh powers to enable the Minister to ensure that fish farmers are registered. It may come as a surprise to some noble Lords to learn that, so far, they are not registered. There is no guarantee that anybody knows quite where they all are. It is obviously of the most vital importance that one should know where these fish farms are. In fact, nothing would be really workable without that knowledge.<lb/>
Furthermore, power is given to make fish farmers keep records. We all hate keeping records, but again this is a point of considerable importance, and one
<col>382</col>
would hope that the records would be kept to the absolute minimum. They might be records showing the movement of fish and the quantity of fish kept on the farm, which would go hand in hand with the record of the species kept, and so on. This seems to me to be the skeleton of the Bill on which other matters must be built.<lb/>
In Clause 6 we come to shellfish. This is a very interesting area but it is a little out of my realm. Previously, under the shellfish Act which I mentioned, there were prohibitions against bringing shellfish into an area&#x2014;certain areas outlined on a map of the British Isles. Clause 6 seems to bring the shellfish situation into line with the inland fish farming situation, where shellfish not only cannot be brought in to a designated area but cannot be taken out either. That again seems absolutely logical and sensible. I have nothing more to add about shellfish except that I believe it is an area where one would hope that, with sensible controls, perhaps coming in with your Lordships' approval, there might be scope for some considerable expansion.<lb/>
I hope that I have been able to outline this Bill with reasonable clarity. If the fish farming industry is to progress and fulfil its full potential, the strengthening of the 1937 Act is absolutely essential. It would be a very good thing if the fish farming industry did progress and grow larger along the right lines. It has done a good job so far in saving imports. It may not be a grand affair but, when I started fish farming, Billingsgate and every other fish market was full of Japanese, Danish and Italian fish, and that is no longer so. They still come in, but not to the same extent. But if in expanding the industry we also spread disease to each other's fish farms and, worse still, pollute our natural waters&#x2014;whether they be the seas or the rivers of this country&#x2014;then it will be a real tragedy. This Bill is of the greatest importance to fish farmers, to riparian owners and to anglers. I should like to commend it to your Lordships. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01363">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Radnor.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01364">6.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01365"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, one of the nice things about this House is the connections one renews. For many years I sat under the noble Earl's father as a governor of the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering. He was a man of great perception and handled his governorship and chairmanship very well indeed. I can see something of the father in the son, in the way that the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, introduced this Bill today&#x2014;and I should like to compliment him on that. He has, obviously, deep knowledge of the subject, being a fish farmer himself. Like the noble Earl, I should like to compliment the originator of this Bill who was lucky enough in the draw in another place to introduce this Bill, which we all hope we can get through by Friday. As we all heard, a few moments ago, it is to be dealt with tomorrow.<lb/>
This Bill seems to be very pleasing and satisfying to the NFUs of all the countries concerned, and that is always a good sign. As the noble Earl has said, it has become quite an industry. He gave figures showing how it has developed over the years. He mentioned the fact that motoring up from Salisbury not many years ago he never passed a fish farm&#x2014;but today, as we all
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0200"/>
<col>383</col>
know, one can hardly go anywhere without seeing a sign announcing trout for sale.<lb/>
I do hope that the suggestion made in another place at Committee stage, that fish farming be called "aquaculture", is not taken up. I believe that the term "fish farming" is much better and that "aquaculture" is really going beyond a joke. We already have agriculture and horticulture, and in some areas we even have "horseyculture"&#x2014;an expression I do not like, either. I have nothing against the horse but just feel that that is going a bit too far.<lb/>
This Bill, as the noble Earl pointed out, is necessary because when one gets intensification&#x2014;and we are experiencing intensification in nearly everything in agriculture at present&#x2014;there are always problems. One has only to witness this in the case of other stock, be it the fattening of pigs, poultry or even cattle. In the case of agriculture, we are getting into a fantastic situation with cereal diseases. We might even have a Diseases of Cereals Bill&#x2014;although I hope I shall not see it&#x2014;in this House, which would give us a far bigger headache than any other Bill I can think of. This question of intensification requires looking at and this Bill is dealing with it, and is doing so in good time.<lb/>
When the original Bill was introduced in another place, some points arose at Committee stage which were quite interesting. One of them was mentioned by the noble Earl, and it was the matter of compensation if there happens to be a disease where the fish have to be destroyed. We have had cases of fowl pest, which have compensation (although it is a different system now); foot and mouth has compensation; and Aujeszky's disease in pigs has compensation by a levy.<lb/>
I wonder what the noble Viscount would think of a levy of some description or some method of giving compensation if a fish farmers' stock had to be destroyed and he was put out of business for some considerable time? We have such an arrangement in the case of foot and mouth disease, although there is no compensation for the loss of profits in the case of foot and mouth disease&#x2014;one has to insure against that. At Committee stage in another place, it was suggested that there could be insurance&#x2014;but if one insures for loss of profits, then there should be some system of compensation for loss of one's stock.<lb/>
Then the noble Earl mentioned the question of registration and records. As he said, all of us dislike keeping records, but it is absolutely necessary. When there is an outbreak of foot and mouth records are kept so that animals all over that area can be traced very quickly, and it is an essential part of the system. But it is not going to be an easy one to enforce to begin with. There is the question of registration fees, which was mentioned in Committee in another place. I would have thought that if registration was mandatory it should be free. Otherwise, if it was voluntary and there was a voluntary levy it may be suggested that there should be a fee; that fee has not been decided yet and it will no doubt come out when it is seen what the cost is going to be.<lb/>
There is the question of sea fisheries, what will be a fish farm and what will not, when it is on the coast. Another thing about the Bill is the question of siting, whether if you have a farm you can site your fish section of it anywhere you wish, or whether the
<col>384</col>
Minister would be given some power of planning control over fish farming. I do not know the answer, but I think it is something that needs to be looked at very carefully. I remember when the fishing grants for sea farming were brought in a few months ago in this House, I asked what would be the case if somebody pumped sea water into an inland reservoir, whether that would be considered salt water farming. I do not think I ever got an answer to that, and that is a little problem that might arise in regard to fish farming.<lb/>
Then, of course, there is this problem of definition and how you get normal fishing excluded from fish farming. At Committee stage in another place the longest debate took place on the question of barring certain equipment for netting, particularly the gill net, mainly because if a fish gets enmeshed in a gill net it causes injury, particularly in smaller fish, and I gathered that that is a reason for disease spreading in injured fish. I am surprised that this was left out of the Bill. I think the Minister in charge of the Bill gave an undertaking that this would be looked at at some future date. Those are all the points that I want to make. I think this is a very necessary Bill, and it has been put forward to this House by the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, very well indeed, So far as we are concerned, we give it our blessing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01366">6.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01367"><member>Lord Tryon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, for clearly introducing this Bill; he did it in a very nice, clear, low-key way. I think if I had been in his shoes I would have stressed the urgency a little more, but then I look at it more from a fisheries point of view than from that of a trout farmer. I will come back to that later, but all is not always particularly peaceful between the fish farmers of the country and those who look after the river systems in which the fish farms operate. However, I am delighted at the news we had from the Government Chief Whip that this Bill still has a very sporting chance of survival and becoming an Act before the end of this Session.<lb/>
I believe that this Bill is just in time for the sport of fishing and for the fish farming industry, because otherwise we were heading for trouble. The noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, mentioned the intensive keeping of animals in unnatural conditions, which fish farming does, and indeed fish and trout are as susceptible to disease as anything else, possibly more so. There is also the problem with any fish disease in a river system that water flows downhill. That sounds an awfully simple remark, but if you imagine a lot of people in a narrow tunnel with a soft breeze blowing through it, if the man at the front sneezes loudly enough there is a fair chance that everybody else will catch a cold; so it is with the poor fish, and a big outbreak of disease in a fish farm can go down the river.<lb/>
I set out for the House today with a lengthy list of reasons and examples as to why this Bill was necessary, and indeed a few suggestions as to improvement, or, rather more accurately, additions that could be made. However, with the general election now announced, and it being perfectly clear that there must be no interference with this Bill if we are to get it through, preferring, as always, half of a good cake to no cake at all, I will not be proposing any amendments; nor will
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0201"/>
<col>385</col>
I expound at length on the virtues of the Bill; I seem to sense that the House has accepted its virtues.<lb/>
I have to declare an interest at this stage, although I hope noble Lords will see it more as a qualification for speaking on this somewhat obscure subject than anything more sinister. I am effectively a shareholder and a director of a fish farm by virtue of my membership of a fishing club in Hampshire of which, very democratically, all the very few members are both shareholders and directors; and we do operate a trout farm within the meaning of the Act, although it is largely for restocking purposes and the surplus fish are sold to other people. The noble Earl, Lord Radnor, said that he used to drive to London without passing a trout farm. I think that is not strictly true because in fact he passed that trout farm, which has been in existence very much longer than has his; namely, 100 years or more. The noble Earl laughs; he knows the one I mean.<lb/>
I said earlier that this was half of a good cake, and I say that because I have done quite a lot of homework on this Bill and I am absolutely assured that it has been very thoroughly dealt with in the other place by Members who have considerable knowledge of the subject, whose hearts were in it and who pursued it very thoroughly indeed. I am no parliamentary draftsman, but I am as convinced as one can be that there are no i's to dot and t's to cross and that the Bill is in good shape.<lb/>
May I suggest, however, that this is an opportunity&#x2014;and it would not be a waste of our time&#x2014;to raise two very important matters which are not covered by the Bill but are in need of legislation shortly. The first is directly concerned with fish farming and its impact on fisheries and fishing in our rivers. It sounds a small matter, but I hope I will show that it is a matter of considerable concern to the fisheries with whom the fish farms have to exist. It relates to the gratings used at the top and bottom ends of the flow of water through the fish farms. It seems that no regulatory authority has any jurisdiction in this matter. The National Farmers' Union guidelines, which I understand is the document that aspiring fish farmers and existing ones refer to from time to time, are quite silent on the subject. Incidentally, the NFU guidelines are fairly long on very sensible suggestions, but very short on details. If the NFU is listening, they could well do with some up-dating.<lb/>
To return to the gratings, and to start at the upstream end, there seems to be some evidence in some rivers that smelts, the young salmon descending down the rivers, are becoming either trapped against the gratings at the upstream end of fish farms or passing through into the fish farms and being trapped there. A standard of grating should be imposed upon fish farms to ensure that this is not possible. Alternatively, a by-pass for the smelts should be provided, or it should be ensured that they are lifted out by some method and put back safely below the fish farm. With the state of salmon as it is, it is vital that every smelt should get back safely to the sea. I gather that is not always happening.<lb/>
At the downstream end of the fish farms the problem is one of escapees from the fish farms. Noble Lords may think that fishery owners adjacent to fish farms would be delighted with a bit of free restocking.
<col>386</col>
But that is not always so. They have not welcomed fish from the fish farms among the wild popoulation. Frequently they are of the wrong breed. For example, small rainbow trout may get loose among a fishery that tries to concentrate on brown trout. The balance of the ecology, and the number of fish in a fishery, are very delicate matters. Angling literature is full of examples of waters being over-stocked, which totally ruins the fishing in the process. What happens is not, as one might expect, that some fish die and the stock then balances itself. All the fish in the fishery suffer. Therefore, a sudden arrival&#x2014;obviously accidental because no fish farmer wants to lose fish, but they are just careless&#x2014;should be prevented as far as possible.<lb/>
The second matter, touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, that is lacking in the Bill but on which I hope we shall get some action from the next Government, whichever it might be, is the question of monofilament gill nets. As we have heard, this was brought up in another place under this Bill, the argument being that salmon which escape from these nets, which is quite frequent, are badly damaged by them. They have big cuts and gashes on them, as I have often seen. When this was raised in the other place the Government Minister, Mr. Buchanan-Smith, said on Third Reading:
<quote>"It would not be appropriate to deal with the matter now at length, but there is no evidence of a causal connection between certain type of tackle and disease"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Commons, 22/4/83: col. 552.</i>].</quote>
The scientists may not yet have come up with the full answer on that, but I should have thought that any animal suffering the loss of large parts of its skin and covered in raw patches must be more vulnerable to disease than animals that are unharmed.<lb/>
Gill nets for salmon, in my view, remain a national disgrace and are operated by those who seek to reap where they sow nothing. The species will rapidly become endangered. They are not subject to any effective control, and I trust that the next Government will urgently grasp this nettle. This is a non-party matter and, if your Lordships will excuse me, I can do no better than to quote from what Mr. Mark Hughes, a Labour Member, said on Second Reading on the subject of gill nets:
<quote>"Finally, it is the will of the House of Commons that the use of monofilament gill nets"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Commons</i>, 22/4/83; col. 552.]</quote>
Did I hear, "Order"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01368"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord is out of order in quoting a named Member of the other House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01369"><member>Lord Tryon</member><membercontribution>: I stand corrected, my Lords, but I believe I may paraphrase. What he said, in effect, was that everyone, apart from the gill netters themselves, now seemed to be agreed that gill nets were thoroughly undesirable in every possible way and that it was time something was done about it. I could not agree more with that, and I pass on that remark.<lb/>
To conclude, fish farming, as we have heard from the noble Earl, Lord Radnor, is a rapidly growing industry. Rod fishing is a rapidly growing sport; perhaps one of the fastest growing in the country. The National Anglers' Council says that about six people an hour are taking up fishing for the first time. That is
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0202"/>
<col>387</col>
quite a growth spread over the year and, as we know, adds up to many millions of people with trout fishermen alone now standing at the remarkable figure of about 800,000. All of this is at risk from disease unless we are very careful, and this Bill is the first useful step to our being more careful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01370">6.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01371"><member>Viscount Long</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I first congratulate my noble friend Lord Radnor upon bringing this Bill before your Lordships, and say how pleasant it is to be here with what is virtually a non-controversial Bill, but a very important one for the fish farming industry as a whole. My noble friend started off with the echoes of one of our late noble friends, Lady Emmet, who never wasted a moment from the Back-Benches to inform whoever was Minister of Agriculture that fish farming was a very important subject, and she would never let it rest at that. I am sure that she would be very proud that we are now going one step ahead to help fish farming in regard to fish farming diseases.<lb/>
My noble friend mentioned also, as he commenced his Second Reading speech, that this is now a very up and coming and growing industry. I understand that there are now about 470 fish farms scattered about the country. I can probably name one more which is just opening in my own town of Bradford-on-Avon. Therefore, in listening to your Lordships this evening I welcome and sympathise with all that has been said, and, whatever we can do to help the fish farming industry, this is where it should begin. Therefore, on behalf of the Government I welcome the Bill.<lb/>
Although the Bill was not introduced by the Government, it has received the Government's wholehearted support. The Bill concerns fish diseases and as such is of particular interest to the fish farming industry. Fish farming is a small but important part of food production in this country and, as I have already said, a growing industry. The measures that the Bill introduces will provide a significant step forward in fish disease control and prevention. I am pleased, therefore, that the Bill has been welcomed by the fish farming industry as a whole.<lb/>
In England, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has responsibility for the policy and implementation of legislation which the Bill amends: the Diseases of Fish Act 1937 and the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967; in Wales and in Scotland these Acts are the responsibilities of our right honourable friends the Secretaries of State.<lb/>
Both the 1937 and 1967 Acts are amended by the Bill so as to give Ministers powers that go wider than those currently contained in those Acts. For example, the amendments to the Diseases of Fish Act 1937 will mean that it will be possible to take precautionary disease control measures at a much earlier stage, thus helping to stop the spread of fish disease. The amendment to the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 will mean that, in addition to controls on depositing shellfish, it will now be possible to control the taking of shellfish from specified areas, again helping to stop the spread of disease.<lb/>
As your Lordships have heard, the Bill also introduces new powers in relation to registration and record-keeping by fish farms and shellfish farming
<col>388</col>
businesses. This will provide Ministers with information hitherto not available which will enable movements of fish and eggs or shellfish to be traced if there should be an outbreak of disease.<lb/>
These powers already exist in relation to animal disease and, similarly, are essential for fish and shellfish diseases if we are to have a chance of keeping ahead of the most virulent diseases on the notifiable disease list. Thankfully, some of these diseases have not been found in our fish, but the economic implications for fish and shellfish farmers, were they to occur, would be disastrous. Something of what can happen has been seen recently in relation to bonamia in shellfish. The situation in relation to disease does not stay still. The Government are, and will continue to be, in close contact with the industry to ensure that the powers provided in this Bill, taken with existing powers, will be selectively used in the way most suited to the circumstances of a disease. The vast majority of responsible fish farmers and shellfishermen recognise the need for the provisions of the Bill and welcome the protection which tighter control should give against the minority who could put their livelihoods at risk.<lb/>
I have listened to some very interesting speeches this evening. I feel that I should now try to answer some of the questions which have been asked. My noble friend Lord Radnor mentioned the control of the movements of fish, eggs and food into farms, as I believe did other noble Lords. The Bill provides a general order-making power. Orders will be made individually in each case, as is appropriate. As now, movements will be controlled only to the extent necessary in the circumstances. Some flexibility may be possible, depending on the risk, and it may be possible to authorise certain categories of movement. This is how we have dealt with diseases in the past. We shall continue to develop our policies in consultation with the industry. There will be no sudden general imposition of tighter controls on infected sites. That is not the purpose of the provision.<lb/>
My noble friend and other noble Lords were worried about the list of diseases. The Bill enables diseases to be added to a list of notifiable diseases, and removed from it, and for this to be done more swiftly than under the 1937 Act. The changes will be made by order, subject to the negative resolution procedure. Speed can be of the essence if a new disease threatens fish stocks. Our scientists will keep the list of notifiable diseases under review, and make recommendations as circumstances change.<lb/>
I believe that my noble friend and others were quite worried about the import of fish and eggs from Northern Ireland. The Bill provides for the amendment of the Diseases of Fish Act 1937 to enable the absolute prohibition of the import into Great Britain of live salmonids to be relaxed by order. Following consultations among English, Scottish and Northern Ireland Ministers, it was decided to instruct our scientists and veterinary experts to consider further the absolute ban on the imports of live salmonids from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. Obviously, the outcome of that examination is not yet known. It may be that some relaxation can sensibly and safely be allowed; it may be that the existing absolute prohibition will have to be adhered to. We shall have to wait to see. However, it seems sensible to
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0203"/>
<col>389</col>
provide for the possibility at some time in the future of allowing some imports of live salmonids into Great Britain from Northern Ireland, or conceivably from elsewhere. The Bill provides for this eventuality. I hope that the answers I am giving are a help to the House, because we should like the Bill to go through before the end of this week.<lb/>
My noble friend asked a further question regarding the registration and keeping of records. We propose to make an order establishing a scheme of registration for fish farmers as soon as possible after the Act comes into force. Without the registration and the keeping of stock and movement records, we cannot hope to trace the movements of fish and consequently cannot keep one step ahead of a disease. I should stress that there will be no question of refusing registration; all fish farmers will be on the register.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, mentioned a further worry as to the compensation of fish farmers. The Government understand the wish for the compensation of fish farmers who may face financial hardships as a result of the Ministry's movement control measures. The question of compensation is a difficult one. It has been raised in the context of our review of inland and coastal fisheries. The Government have listened with interest to the representations that have been made; but we do not think that this is the time for a decision. More discussions are needed and will take place to analyse the problems and ensure that we get the approach right. When solutions emerge we shall consider any implications for legislation.<lb/>
However, I should like to bring one further point to your Lordships' attention. In the animal health field, compensation is paid only in respect of animals slaughtered compulsorily. Ministers do not at present have a power of compulsory slaughter in relation to fish disease. This Bill does not seek to provide them with one. I would recommend to your Lordships that the questions of compulsory slaughter and compensation are linked together. We should not try to separate them. This is not the appropriate forum for these issues to be resolved, and we should permit the separate discussions on these complex issues to go forward unhindered. The Bill before us has tackled many questions on which there is wide agreement. We should seek to secure these measures and consolidate them, and not put them at risk by trying to address matters of great controversy to which solutions have not yet emerged.<lb/>
I turn to a further point raised by the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, and, indeed, by the noble Lord, Lord Tryon, and that concerns gill-netting. When this Bill was considered in another place there was a full and valuable discussion about the use of monofilament gill-nets to catch salmon. It is the Government's view that this subject is outside the scope of this Bill. This Bill is designed to extend the protection for farmed fish from diseases, and is not primarily concerned either with methods of commercial fishing or with fish in the wild.<lb/>
A number of amendments were tabled in another place which sought to introduce into the Bill measures designed to control the practice of monofilament gill-net fishing for salmon. However, controls on the use of
<col>390</col>
monofilament gill-nets are already available to water authorities in England and Wales under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. Under that Act, water authorities have extensive responsibilities over the fisheries in their areas and they have wide powers to make bylaws banning or regulating the use of different sorts of nets. A number of water authorities have already made such bylaws. However, I am very well aware that the water authorities face problems in enforcing their bylaws. Therefore, the answer must not be to produce even more legislation but to enforce the existing controls effectively.<lb/>
In Scotland, there is a complete ban on the use of drift nets from fishing boats for catching salmon and migratory trout. The issue of the use of a particular type of net such as microfilament gill-nets therefore does not arise. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland makes strenuous efforts to ensure that the ban is enforced.<lb/>
One of the arguments put forward for the need to control the use of monofilament gill nets was that such nets were a contributory factor to the spread of disease among fish because fish that escaped from the nets were invariably injured and maimed, making them more susceptible to disease. However, in the light of scientific guidance there is no casual connection between certain types of tackle and diseases. All nets can injure fish, but I have no evidence that monofilament gill nets cause proportionately more damage than others. Scientific advisers have presented preliminary reports on the use and distribution of gill nets in England and Wales and on a survey of public literature about the use of gill nets in other countries. These reports do not demonstrate that the gill nets cause undue damage to fish, or that any regulatory measures are needed. These reports have been placed in the Library of the House. However, these are only preliminary reports. If the final report produces evidence which will mean further controls to establish that banning, and so on, might be necessary for certain reasons, the Government will have a totally open mind and a readiness to consider the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01372"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was interesting to hear that scientists say that gill-netting does not do any harm or any more harm than other types of netting. Would the noble Viscount care to take a nylon cord through his hand quickly and then compare the difference between that and a natural fibre cord?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01373"><member>Viscount Long</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I see that the noble Lord is a fisherman. I am not. I do not know how cruel one can be towards a fish, but I am sure that netting does injure them.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, mentioned registration fees. The Bill requires that a registration fee shall not exceed the cost of registration. That appears in Clause 7(6). If that is any help, it is one small step forward. The noble Lord also asked about inland fish farms using pumped sea water. Such farms are dealt with in the same way as inland farms using fresh water. I am not an expert on whether you tap the salt water straight from the sea or add salt to it. I hope, however, that my answer is what the noble Lord requires.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0204"/>
<col>391</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Tryon, mentioned gratings on fish farms. That is a good point which can be taken up in continuing discussions with Ministers and the National Farmers' Union in England and Wales. The noble Lord will be relieved to learn that the NFU guidelines are currently under revision in this forum, as he probably already knows. I am not a fish farmer, nor an expert on fish; nor am I an expert on aquaculture. I hope however that my answers to your Lordships' questions will have helped the progress of the Bill. I hope that the Bill goes through the House at the earliest opportunity in order to help fish farming. In the meantime, I congratulate my noble friend and leave him to wind up the debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01374">7.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01375"><member>The Earl of Radnor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, and the noble Lord, Lord Tryon, for giving the Bill such a kind and considerate reception, slightly critical in places. I thank my noble friend Lord Long for putting the Government's position so clearly and sympathetically. I must admit that I was pleased to hear (if I heard rightly) that the remaining stages of the Bill will be dealt with tomorrow. That is very important. It is like sitting on a volcano, with had diseases abroad and with a growing industry. To put this Bill back at this stage and not to bring it forward to the statute book would constitute a real danger to the fisheries of England.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Long has done so well that there is nothing much for me to say. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, in the hope that this subject will not be called aquaculture. I shall continue to call myself a fish farmer and not an aquaculturist. That term does not seem to suit either the job or the people who perform it. I like the idea of a levy to guard against possible compensation. There is one enormous disadvantage. When a levy was exacted for another purpose, it took a long time for fish farmers to agree to part with their pennies to fund a situation that had not yet materialised. It was, however, an extremely good idea. It is very much an aside, but insurance for fish farming is difficult. One is always being asked to count the number of dead fish. If one is dealing with four and a half million, half of them at the bottom of four feet of water, with just their tails sticking out of the mud, it cannot be done. Then there is no payment which, I suppose, is reasonable.<lb/>
The whole question of siting and planning is wide. I would imagine that any Government would keep it under review simply for the reason that the noble Lord, Lord Tryon, mentioned&#x2014;that water runs downhill and that pathogens, I understand, run uphill, or perhaps upstream. The noble Lord also mentioned migrating smolts. In my experience, the water authority deals with that situation. It takes a great deal of trouble to see that they are put in smolt traps or diverted in some way or other, preferably around the farm. It has been many people's experience that once they get into the farm some rather large smolts are found among the trout and there they sit. Whether they ever reach the sea, I do not know. Fortunately, whereas the eel follows the bottom of the current, the smolt follows the top current and goes over waterfalls. It is often possible to see that they are diverted around the farm.<lb/>
<col>392</col>
I am probably wrong, but in my experience I have always assumed that if I have an inadequate grid, this would be considered as polluting the water. Whether or not that is so, we look carefully at grids and water authorities to see that they are behaving themselves. This is possibly a loaded question. The noble Lord who is a little upstream of me on the same river, has perhaps experienced some foreign trout creeping up to him.<lb/>
I do not think there is anything more to say except to feel pleased that Mr. Corrie, in another place, has brought this Bill forward. I congratulate him on his luck in the ballot, and express my great pleasure that the Bill will be carried through. I commend it to your Lordships once again.<lb/>
On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Public Houses: Hours</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01376">7.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01377"><member>Lord Spens</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Unstarred Question standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;namely:
<quote>"To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are prepared to introduce flexible hours of opening of public houses in England and Wales, bearing in mind the success of these arrangements in Scotland".</quote>
The present situation about the licensing laws for England and Wales is governed by the Licensing Act 1964, which is a consolidation Act of previous licensing laws, the latest of which was the 1961 Act and, for Scotland, the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. The former&#x2014;that is the 1964 Act&#x2014;allows little or no flexibility of hours of opening; the latter allows a great deal of flexibility at local discretion.<lb/>
Last November, the Brewers' Society sent to my noble friend Lord Harris of High Cross, in his capacity, I hope, as secretary of our little repeals group, of which I am the chairman, a draft of a Bill to abolish:
<quote>"the restrictions in the Licensing Act 1964 on the hours during which intoxicating liquor may be sold, supplied or consumed in licensed premises or in the premises of a registered club".</quote>
This, in fact, meant the repeal of the whole of Part III of the 1964 Act, which deals with permitted hours&#x2014;a subject in which my small committee found itself very interested.<lb/>
At the same time the Brewers' Society published an article in the trade magazine <i>Brewing Review</i> entitled "Pot Luck". It said:
<quote>"The laws governing pub hours vary all over the British Isles: getting a pint depends on where you are&#x2014;and when".</quote>
It set out the differences in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and in the isles around us, showing up glaring inconsistencies.<lb/>
Meanwhile, I had been in touch with the National Union of Licensed Victuallers, who said in June of last year that they liked the idea of bringing the English law into line with the Scottish, but that some preparatory work would have to be done first. I met their parliamentary committee some three weeks ago and I was asked then to initiate this Question which I am asking today. The result of this is that I have a joint brief from
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0205"/>
<col>393</col>
the Brewers' Society and the National Union of Licensed Victuallers which is a very useful document.<lb/>
So, my Lords, what are the differences? In this respect I do not propose to involve myself with the special problems that exist in Wales. I am not sure whether we have any Welshmen who are to speak today, but the problem of whether certain parts of the country should be "wet" or "dry" on Sundays is for them to settle and not for us. No, this is a general approach to Her Majesty's Government about introducing flexibility into the permitted hours of opening in England and Wales. At present the situation is governed by Section 60 in Part III of the 1964 Act, which lays down general rules about permitted hours of opening&#x2014;basically, between 11 a.m. and 10.30 p.m., with a break of two and a half hours from 3 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. There are variations for Sundays and holidays which I do not think need affect us today. That was the situation under the 1964 Act.<lb/>
In 1972 the Departmental Committee on Liquor Licensing, which was chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Erroll of Hale, presented a unanimous report. Of course it covered a great many matters, but on flexible hours the committee recommended:
<quote>"that a personal licensee be permitted to sell intoxicating liquor by retail for on-consumption at any time between 10 a.m. and midnight."</quote>
The committee qualified that by saying:
<quote>"We are not suggesting that licensees should be compelled to open",</quote>
for all those hours. They wanted the choice left with each individual licensee.<lb/>
A further recommendation would give the power to licensing justices to impose:
<quote>"a limited restriction on permitted hours of opening, provided they are satisfied that this is in the interests of public order, safety, health of amenity".</quote>
Those recommendations have not been implemented by any of Her Majesty's Governments since 1972.<lb/>
Meanwhile, in Scotland a similar departmental committee known as the Clayson Committee reported a year later in 1973 and made recommendations on the flexibility of hours very similar to those of the Erroll Committee. The Scottish Office acted on that report by producing the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976. On flexibility of hours of opening, that Act contains provisions on permitted hours very like those in the 1964 Act. But there is an additional provision in Section 64 entitled:
<quote>"Occasional and regular extensions of permitted hours".</quote>
It is that additional provision which has brought about the flexibility of hours of opening in Scotland in different locations. The additional hours have to be granted locally. Therefore, flexibility of hours is not operating throughout the whole of Scotland, but only in parts. This has been, we think, a great success. However, it is very difficult to find out from Her Majesty's Government whether it has in fact been a success or not.<lb/>
Last June, in answer to an Oral Question, the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, who I see on the Government Front Bench, replied to me:
<quote>"the Government have no firm information on the effects of the extension of permitted hours in Scotland, nor have they received any representation that the increased hours have had any adverse effects".</quote>
<col>394</col>
The noble Lord went on to say:
<quote>"I am able to say that there has been no significant increase in drunkenness offences or motor vehicle offences caused through drink since the 1976 Act came into force"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18/6/1982; col. 770.]</quote>
That is a very important comment by Her Majesty's Government because a great many of the objections to flexibility of hours have come from people who think that more drunkenness and more drink and driving offences would occur.<lb/>
A second Question was asked only three weeks ago by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury. This time his Question was:
<quote>"What assessment has Her Majesty's Government made of the effects of the relaxation of the licensing laws in Scotland in 1976 and 1977?"</quote>
The noble Earl, Lord Mansfield, said:
<quote>"The Government have made no recent assessment of the effects &#x2026; An earlier survey, carried out immediately before the coming into operation of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976, with following surveys in March 1977 and November 1978, indicated that there was no significant change in the average consumption of alcohol, since those drinking tended to do so at a more leisurely pace, and supported the suggestion that changes in the licensing laws had produced no adverse effect."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25/4/83; col. 798.]</quote>
That comment is, I think, a very important one, because it is the contention of both the Brewers' Society and the National Union of Licensed Victuallers that there is not likely to be any great increase in the expenditure on alcohol by any particular person if the hours are flexible. People go into pubs with a certain amount of money in their pocket and they will spend it. At the moment, if they are near to closing time, they spend it quickly. If the laws were to be more flexible, they would have much more time to spend their money and would be much less likely to become drunk, with all the nasty effects that that may have.<lb/>
The worries about the introduction of flexibility are included in a discussion pamphlet entitled <i>Drinking Sensibly</i>, which was issued by the Department of Health and Social Security in 1981. There is a bit about flexible hours there. On the whole, I would suggest that they treat the matter rather neutrally: they do not really shoot it down or commend it. However, in that pamphlet there was one interesting little comment about what happened in the state of Victoria in Australia when that state extended the final hour of opening from 6 p.m. until 10 p.m. It says:
<quote>"A study of the effect on motor accidents of a change in closing time from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. found that although the overall total of personal injury accidents remained unchanged, the previous accident peak between 6 and 7 p.m. had disappeared and had been replaced by one between 10 and 11 p.m. It is accordingly possible that changes in licensing hours had significantly affected drinking patterns without apparently influencing overall consumption."</quote>
That is a point which both the Brewers' Society and the National Union of Licensed Victuallers make&#x2014;that they do not anticipate any large increase in the personal consumption of any particular individual. What they do anticipate is that there will be more people finding time to make use of the pubs if there is more opportunity for them to get to those pubs. So we hope that the advantages will outweigh the disadvantages. The advantages of flexibility are really that the gap during the afternoon, when pubs have to close, would disappear to the benefit especially of foreign tourists. I live in Kent and I see foreign tourists passing through who are absolutely infuriated when they
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0206"/>
<col>395</col>
arrive at a pub at about 3.30 p.m. and are told that they cannot get any intoxicating liquor until 5.30 p.m.<lb/>
Publicans could time their opening hours to fit in with local conditions. That is particularly the case where there is a large factory working on s shift system. At the moment some shifts end at the time when the pubs have to close. It would also mean that in holiday resorts the pubs could keep open during the afternoon and possibly not open so early in the morning.<lb/>
The point here is that each licensee should be given an opportunity to decide how long his pub should be kept open. He does not necessarily have to keep the pub open for the whole time. He can introduce a break at any time that suits him and that suits his local clientele. One should remember that a licensee is a very responsible person because, if he behaves irresponsibly, his licence will be taken away from him. Of course, this is not so much the case with other places where alcohol can be purchased at all hours of the day, particularly supermarkets, where there does not appear to be that amount of supervision, especially over the age of the purchaser, which a responsible licensee will exercise.<lb/>
Therefore, Scotland is in the lead. I am an expatriate Scot and I have very little opportunity of enjoying the benefits of the flexibility of hours which exist in Scotland. I hope that Her Majesty's Government will very soon give us down here the opportunity of enjoying those benefits. I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01378">7.28 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01379"><member>Baroness Sharples</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Spens, for initiating this Question. I may not be the only Member of your Lordships' House to own a pub, but I do believe that I am the sole licensee here. So for those two reasons I must declare an interest. Over some months now I have seen at first hand the real need for more flexible hours within the existing framework of the permitted 62&#x00BD; hours per week. In my pub we work a 53-hour week, which I think is sufficient for our area. However, with plans for expansion I can see restrictions on our enterprise as things stand. As the noble Lord, Lord Spens, knows well&#x2014;for he is a part of my Back Bench group on small businesses&#x2014;we have these considerations with regard to forward-looking enterprises very much in mind.<lb/>
A rural inn such as mine would benefit greatly if it could remain open until midnight, and at lunchtime until three o'clock. I can assure your Lordships that customers travel considerable distances for a good meal. As the noble Lord, Lord Spens, has said, licensees are highly responsible people&#x2014;they have to be. Surely they can be relied upon to run their businesses well, for if they do not they go out of business. It is as simple as that. Competition is extremely fierce and many pubs have indeed closed. We can, as the noble Lord, Lord Spens, said, lose our licences, and that of course means that we lose our livelihood as well, if we trangress the law.<lb/>
The police have not been mentioned much today, but surely the police would prefer a fixed later hour of midnight. Then they would not have to go around the
<col>396</col>
neighbourhood seeing whether somebody who had a licence until the normal closing hour of 10.30 was not staying open until 11.00, and that the people allowed to stay open until 11.00 were not staying open until 11.30. I think that they have to waste a great deal of time.<lb/>
Times are changing fast. There is far more leisure time, sadly due to unemployment but also due to the shorter working week. As the noble Lord, Lord Spens, said, why should we not follow the Scots? There does not seem to be any proof, if that is what we are looking for, that there is more drinking leading to more accidents and to more crime&#x2014;which perhaps is even more important than car accidents&#x2014;although of course people feared that that would happen.<lb/>
Our EEC partners think that we are absolutely crazy about our licensing hours. As many noble Lords who have travelled abroad will know, the French often remark on this. Tourism is of tremendous value to this country, and this is a point worth thinking about. I hope that my noble friend can give some hint as to when we might see a really sensible and constructive approach to the flexible hours suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Spens. I can assure my noble friend that if we receive such encouragement it will receive widespread approval from the vast majority of licensees, not least myself.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01381"><member>The Earl of Minto</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no wish whatsoever to enter into this particular debate on this Question on any form of prohibitionist ticket. I have been for over 15 years closely associated with the field of alcoholism and alcohol abuse in Scotland. I have also been for many years the chairman of the Scottish Council on Alcoholism. But I should like to make it clear before I go any further that those over whom I take the chair in all the voluntary agencies throughout Scotland&#x2014;because we are differently organised to in England&#x2014;as well as myself, have a deep detestation of the prohibition lobby, on the basis in Scotland of the terrible damage that we have seen done by it in those areas of our native country which subscribe somewhat to it for social or religious reasons. Therefore, I rise as a humble Scot on a Question which pertains essentially to England and Wales, but I also rise with the, I hope, useful knowledge of a little of what has happened in Scotland since the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976.<lb/>
If one is going to ask Her Majesty's Government for a view upon a particular question, I would have thought it fairly reasonable that all your Lordships would, in one way or another, look for evidence, and that it would be upon that evidence that you would hope to receive your reply from the Government. Although I have said that the Scottish Council on Alcoholism is entirely separate and autonomous from anything in England, I have received correspondence which has asked me to pass on to your Lordships the apologies of the noble Earl, Lord Kimberley, for his unavoidable absence. On his behalf, for he is chairman of the National Council on Alcoholism which deals with south of Scotland&#x2014;and, as I say, somewhat differently from us&#x2014;may I express his apologies for his absence, and his wish to be associated with those remarks I may make where they affect England.<lb/>

What evidence do we in fact have? There are three research reports available which are relevant. The first was by Bruce in 1978, and the noble Lord, Lord Spens, has already referred to it. He interviewed 1,700 Scots, all adults, before the first changes in the law came into effect in 1976. Then again, he interviewed them three months later. He also collected sales data from 40 bars which had taken advantage of what we call the "extra hour". He concluded:
<quote>"The survey of licensed premises showed a significant reduction in pattern acceleration in drinking towards the end of the evening. Thus, although the "beat the clock attitude" to drinking has not disappeared, it has at least diminished".</quote>
This overall favourable report was followed by a publication by Knight and Wilson in 1980 based upon research undertaken between October and November 1978, also referred to by my noble friend Lord Spens. That was some two years after the extension of permitted hours. The report was primarily aimed at Sunday opening. However, the findings within the area on the extra hour tended to support Bruce. With regard to Sunday opening, on the other hand, the report found that while the sample as a whole had not increased their weekly consumption of alcohol, subgroups within the sample had altered their drinking behaviour. For instance, those young males who had earlier reported high levels of consumption now reported a very significant increase in their drinking. Thus, the impact appears to have been one of facilitating the drinking of heavy drinkers, but does not seem to have altered the drinking habits of the more moderate males or females. In view of the Clayson recommendations this was an important finding.<lb/>
"All day" licensing has only been widespread in Scotland during the past three or four years. Therefore, in fact there is only one available study upon it, and that is by Davies and Fisher. The study was restricted to Glasgow. The sample of public houses was small&#x2014;only 19 out of Scotland's approximate total of 4,350&#x2014;and difficulties in such studies are well known to your Lordships. Nevertheless, the insight gained was not without interest. The overall impression gained from reading the report&#x2014;and I would strongly recommend your Lordships to do so&#x2014;is that afternoon drinking is not a species apart from lunchtime or evening drinking, but is just more of the same. Different public houses have different types of customers who patronise their favourite establishment at different times and consume varying amounts of alcohol of different types.<lb/>
In saying that I am not in any sense trying to be facetious, but it highlights what appears to be an essential criticism of the current all-day licensing legislation as we know it in Scotland. The Clayson Committee recommendations&#x2014;indeed all the recommendations&#x2014;were based on what is known as the social integrationalist approach to alcohol consumption. Simply stated, this philosophy suggests that by removing restrictions on the availability of alcohol one diminishes the taboos and the myths that exist about alcohol. Greater freedom of use, it is argued, should gradually lead to more responsible use, with the integration of alcohol in the broad fabric of everyday life&#x2014;in other words, alcohol as an unremarkable and unemotive product.<lb/>
<col>398</col>
Controls on the misuse of alchol are shifted from the law to more informal social controls. The classic example of this type of drinking is that of the French and the Italians who consume two or three times more than we do <i>per capita</i> in Scotland, but&#x2014;this is the important point&#x2014;little overt drunkeness is exhibited. Yet what has happened with all-day licensing? As noted earlier with the Sunday opening of public houses, the informal social controls have not been built in with the liberalising of the law. From evidence that is available to us today all that has happened is that the traditional styles of drinking have been extended over a longer period. For example, Davies and Fisher give no indication that the patron of the all-day licensed premises is a new breed of moderate drinker, or, more importantly, that he or she is accompanied by the potential social control of his or her spouse or their children.<lb/>
A further comment on the failure of the legislation to build in social controls alongside the more permissive measures is the fact that by 1979 only 47 out of the 15,800 licensed premises in Scotland, which is 0.3 per cent., were of the refreshment type of facility that allows families to utilise licensed premises.<lb/>
Statistics from the Strathclyde Region&#x2014;and those we never take lightly in Scotland because half the population of Scotland lives in that region&#x2014;show that, in 1980, 99.2 per cent. of all regular extensions were granted to ordinary licensed premises into which children under 14 years of age were not permitted to enter. This is hardly the breeding ground for a revolution, minor or otherwise, in the nation's drinking habits in Scotland.<lb/>
Up North&#x2014;I mean by that, Scotland&#x2014;the main areas of contention about the putative success of the legislation concern official statistics relating to alcohol-related offences. Clayson claimed not so very long ago that since 1976 the,
<quote>"whole totality of drink related offences has diminished".</quote>
Dr. Clayson, whom I know and who is a most honourable man and whom I respect, could make such a statement on statistical evidence only until that statistical evidence was subject to close scrutiny&#x2014;a scrutiny which become all the more necessary when it was observed that it was being most vociferously supported by the licensed trade. It is absolutely true that in 1977 convictions for drunk-driving and drunkenness were on the decline; hence the Minister's answer. But the fact is that this trend had started before the introduction of the 1976 Act so there is a good reason to suppose that the two were unrelated. Indeed, it is relevant to note that, while crimes made known to the police rose by 12 per cent. in the period 1976&#x2013;77, there was a drop of over 5 per cent. in convictions for all crimes and offences.<lb/>
We all know that convictions for any offence are strongly influenced by police activity. Thus it must be drawn to your Lordships' attention that in 1977 police manpower in Scotland was 10 per cent. below establishment and that within Strathclyde Region itself&#x2014;I repeat that that area contains half the population of Scotland&#x2014;a ban on overtime working was enforced. Therefore, the influence of Strathclyde Region's policing had a massive effect upon the national statistics available. For example, in 1979
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0208"/>
<col>399</col>
Strathclyde accounted for 84 per cent. of all convictions for drunkenness in Scotland.<lb/>
Also in 1977 the court staff in Glasgow took it into their heads to take industrial action and many minor offences associated with drink led to police admonition rather than convictions. It is interesting to note that when normal working was resumed and the police manpower increased in Scotland&#x2014;not just Strathclyde&#x2014;by 10 per cent. or by 1,200 officers in 1979 as compared with 1977, convictions for all offences rose. For example, drunk-driving convictions rose from 8,460 in 1977 to 10,594 in 1979&#x2014;hardly, I should have thought, the base on which to claim, whether it be my friend Dr. Clayson or anyone else, that the whole totality of drink-related offences has diminished. So statistics certainly show that any decrease in alcohol offences has been shortlived.<lb/>
Perhaps the most worrying point upon which one may safely place a finger&#x2014;and because it has to do with health maybe it upsets me most&#x2014;is the international evidence which links alcohol-related harm with <i>per capita</i> consumption. As one increases, so does the other. It must be fair to surmise that the legislation which makes alcohol more available and which encourages wide and more prolonged consumption contributes to more rather than less damage. As a horrible example, between 1978 and 1982, deaths from liver cirrhosis alone rose by 27 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01382"><member>A noble Lord</member><membercontribution>: In Scotland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01383"><member>The Earl of Minto</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, in Scotland. It is perhaps proper to note that one of the recommendations made by the Central Policy Review Staff in 1980 was that Scotland should reconsider its all-day legislation and that there should be no adoption of such liberal practices South of the Border.<lb/>
My Lords, before I take my seat once again, may I stress that the agencies to which I have referred in Scotland do not support the prohibition lobby? At the moment I am bombarded&#x0021; There are three points of view, and there have been for about three years. On the one hand, there are those who place to one side and cast away all evidence of damage and who support wholeheartedly the Act of 1976. On the other hand, there are those who claim that all evidence of damage is directly attributable to that same legislation. In the middle, stands the largest group; and I place myself among them. They are those who simply do not know. For us in Scotland, legal parlance might be used, I suppose, and we would say that, in either case, it is not proven.<lb/>
We believe that it can be argued that there is little substance to the claim that the new licensing law has made the Scots into a nation of social drinkers. Although the extra hour does appear to be popular and may have reduced the "10 o'clock swill", this is the only part of the law, the only part, that is above suspicion. The Scottish Council on Alcoholism works very closely with the agencies of the Scottish Office. I have been working alongside them, as I have said, for the past 15 years. I have always found, within this field in Scotland, that, if you take a matter of deep concern to the Scottish Office and that matter has merit,
<col>400</col>
perhaps not immediately but at some time in the future, you get a constructive response.<lb/>
It is now three years since we first voiced our deep concern on this division of opinion in Scotland and we have continued repeatedly to do so. Hence, I place my trust in my experience of the Scottish Office which would suggest to me that we may well expect from them, from the Minister or the Secretary of State, some action in the not too distant future following the collation of the information that they have apparently been gathering. For that reason, I would hope and, indeed, would ask the Government to wait just for a time until they have some hard evidence to hand before committing themselves one way or the other with regard to a change in the licensing laws in England and Wales; for, in my view, it would be premature, if not irresponsible, to act at this point in time.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01385"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the opportunity provided by the noble Lord, Lord Spens, to discuss flexible hours of opening of public houses. Flexible opening has a certain familiar ring to me, and it would be strange if I did not support the essence of this debate. It is difficult to discuss this matter without bringing in the pros and cons of drinking alcoholic beverages. I respect the views of those who sincerely believe that alcohol is the root of all that is evil in this country today, but, although I am well aware that the abuse of drink can cause untold misery&#x2014;and, as a retired magistrate, I have seen much evidence of this&#x2014;yet I do not believe that certain alterations in the opening hours of public houses would aggravate the present situation. I recognise that there is need for more research in this area, and I should like to make the further suggestion that the Government give support to the commission project on this matter.<lb/>
Of course, the Erroll Report, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Spens, could be said to have examined the whole situation very thoroughly. I think it is worth quoting from the concluding paragraph of the chapter of the Erroll Report which deals with public house opening hours. On page 161 it says:
<quote>"In the last analysis the success of our proposal depends on two factors. First, it is essential that the approach of licensees themselves should be directed away from any undue reliance on the letter of the law towards a genuine attempt to interpret local needs and to take effective action to meet them&#x2014;even if this means changing previously established hours of work. The whole point of our proposal would be lost if licensees either felt themselves compelled to open for the full 14 hours permitted by law, or stuck to their present hours of closing, regardless of any demand for alternative hours which might exist in their locality. Second, our recommendations would place a very considerable responsibility on licensing justices, the police and local authorities".</quote>
This brings me to the views of the Justices' Clerks' Society in their paper, <i>Licensing Law in the Eighties</i>, published in April 1983. The society states that they feel that the problems of misuse of alcohol are not susceptible of solution by legislation alone. They most certainly advocate a number of changes in the licensing laws while remaining firmly of the view that the public must be educated from a very early age about the dangers of alcohol abuse. They advocate treatment for alcoholics and charge the Government with the duty to encourage and fund research into the whole problem of alcoholism.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0209"/>
<col>401</col>
I do not believe that the changing of the opening hours of "pubs" would increase the alcoholic problem. It is merely the occasional drinker who would be able to take advantage of the more flexible hours. The Justices' Clerks' Society, alas&#x0021; do not include a recommendation for more flexible opening hours among the various options that they present for amending the present licensing laws. They say that there is no public demand. I think that they are wrong. Why are we having this debate if there is no public demand?<lb/>
There are two last points that I wish to make very briefly. They are that, if we are going to amend the licensing laws, I, like the noble Lord, Lord Spens, and my noble friend the licensed victualler, would hope that we would take note of and fall in with the laws of Europe. Total bewilderment faces tourists either from Europe or from the United States of America who foolishly believe that they can buy a drink when they want, as they do in their own countries.<lb/>
Finally, I would ask your Lordships to spare a thought for the family with young children who take the car and go for a day out in the country and who are forced to eat either in an hotel at great expense or in a cafe (if there is one) because the children cannot enter a public house. Surely, family rooms should become a pleasant and legal accessory to any public house, where the parents may drink and both parents and children may eat. I hope the Government will feel that today's debate will provide impetus towards the research project I have suggested&#x2014;a project which could be speedily set up after the Government have overwhelmingly won the forthcoming general election.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01386">8.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01387"><member>Lord St. John of Bletso</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Spens for introducing this debate on a subject which, although it has been extensively debated, has seen little constructive change to the fragmented and outdated liquor licensing laws that are applied in England and Wales. I shall be reiterating what many of your Lordships have already mentioned and I would ask you to excuse me for doing so.<lb/>
There are some extraordinary anomalies in the way in which the laws operate, and noble Lords have already referred to some of them. For example, one is not allowed to buy a drink in a London pub at midnight but one is allowed to drink at any time on a moving boat, train or plane. Also, children are allowed into some licensed premises but not into others, where they may or may not drink alcohol, depending on a complicated interaction between their ages and the nature of the premises.<lb/>
It is surely time that Her Majesty's Government&#x2014;and I refer to future Governments as well, of course&#x2014;were persuaded that there is a popular demand in this country for action on this subject to complement the many years of "consideration" which, according to ministerial replies, have been devoted to this matter. I would venture to suggest to your Lordships that the people of England and Wales are sufficiently mature to decide for themselves when and where to drink alcohol.<lb/>
I myself support the recommendations of the 1972 Erroll Committee, calling for the reform of the liquor
<col>402</col>
licensing laws and, more specifically, the recommendation that pubs should have the right to remain open from 10 in the morning until midnight, leaving it to landlords to decide exactly when to do business within those hours, as was pointed out by my noble friend Lord Spens. I regret that, so many years after that excellent report was compiled, Her Majesty's Government still feel that the report requires further consideration. I would suggest that the time is ripe for action and I therefore strongly recommend the arguments that were put forward so eloquently by those noble Lords and Baronesses who have spoken before me.<lb/>
There are indeed many advantages to be gained from greater flexibility in licensing laws in England and Wales, and I shall mention a few of them. First, it would allow consumers to make up their own minds when they want to drink. Secondly, tourists would find the country a more congenial place to visit, and we should earn more foreign exchange from their increased spending. The present liquor licensing laws are a considerable handicap to the holiday and tourist industries. Thirdly, the boom in over-priced nightclubs in London would be curtailed and more people would be attracted back to the traditional English pub.<lb/>
It is sad that when one leaves a cinema or theatre in the evening one is often too late to have a relaxing drink in a pub without being pressurised and hassled by the landlord concerned to clear his bar. More employment would be generated by the modest proposals of the noble Lod, Lord Erroll, as bar staff would need to be recruited in order to meet the extra demand. Also, imaginative and industrious licensees would be given the incentives to develop catering and other ancillary services in an effort to compete with licensed restaurants; and this variety would do much to brighten up our cities. The spread of better quality pub food and of pub entertainment has shown consumers the great economic potential of breaking down the rigid division between bars, restaurants and entertainment.<lb/>
I can well appreciate the concern of the opponents of liberalisation, who argue that longer drinking hours would lead to more drinking, which in turn would cause more health problems. This approach, backed by the French demographer, Dr. Sully Lederman and his theory of the "log normal curve", has been seriously undermined and challenged by numerous researchers of late. I would support the theory of the noble Lord, Lord Erroll, that the most decisive influences on consumption rates are the general economic climate and the real price of liquor. It is on this point that parallels can be drawn from the effects of the introduction of flexible drinking hours in Scotland, where I believe it is now possible to buy alcohol in a pub from 10 in the morning until 2 o'clock the following morning, subject to the discretion of the local licensing authorities.<lb/>
Since the liquor licensing laws were liberalised in 1976 in Scotland, statistics have shown that consumption has actually decreased slightly, and so has street drunkenness and drunken driving. I notice that the noble Earl, Lord Minto, seems to disagree with me, but we are all entitled to our own interpretation. Liquor prices in Scotland have remained stable despite higher overheads through
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0210"/>
<col>403</col>
longer hours. More and more places are providing food and generally finding ways of making more money in extra time. The success of the liquor law reforms in Scotland illustrates the inadequacies of fragmentary reform and the viability of such a liquor licensing reform which needs to be introduced in England and Wales.<lb/>
I shall not detain your Lordships further on this subject. The arguments of those of us who have spoken show the great support for flexibility of licensing laws and have been well developed by speakers. I feel that the strength of our case has made it clear that such a reform is indeed most necessary. I look forward to hearing the speech of the great "reformist" in our House, my noble friend Lord Hams of High Cross. I look forward also in due course to the speech of the Minister. I shall be most interested in what he has to say in reply and I hope that he will include some proposals for the reform of the licensing laws rather than further references to the Government's need to contemplate the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01388">8.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01389"><member>Lord Harris of High Cross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree and join in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Spens, in promoting what has so far proved to be a sober and interesting debate on the merits of more flexible opening hours. He pointed out that he has received some support from the informal Repeal Group, which seeks to challenge outdated laws that restrict the freedom of adult citizens to live their own lives without hurting the like freedom of their neighbours. I would say to my noble friend Lord St. John of Bletso that we take one test of whether legislation is outdated by asking: if this law did not exist, would it be necessary to invent it? I believe on that issue the present licensing laws impose objectionable fetters on millions of people that are not justified by any overriding imperatives of public policy.<lb/>
Since some time ago the Tory party appeared to cause some confusion in the public mind between the Peerage and what became known as the "beerage", I think we should all declare an interest, or lack of interest, in this particular form of consumption. From the published figures I find I am well below the average annual consumption of 200 pints of beer per head of the population, although in wine I am safely between the annual average of 170 pints in France and the 14 pints in the United Kingdom. I must tell your Lordships that, although I have never regularly taken advantage of the varied facilities of the 76,000 public houses and licensed hotels in the United Kingdom, I have to admit that on rare occasions I have been known to curse mildly because I could not find a single pub open at a time when it would have been convenient on a journey, on holiday or to celebrate a family or friendly reunion. I commend to your Lordships the thought of how much worse it must be for the millions of our fellow men who through work or from choice do not live their waking lives from approximately dawn until after dusk.<lb/>
We have heard that the present licensing laws were introduced under emergency powers in the First World War, just as Tudor monarchs once clamped down on ale houses to encourage archery. I have no
<col>404</col>
doubt that the stipulated nine or nine and a half hours' opening time from 11 a.m. until 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. generally suit the average convenience of the population. But the question I want to ask is why do averages come into it? The average man does not play golf or visit Covent Garden or even indulge in hunting, shooting and fishing. It does not follow that strictly minority activities should be regulated by reference to average tastes or majority prejudices.<lb/>
In one of the appendices to the excellent Erroll Report there is a summary of an official survey into public attitudes towards licensing laws. It shows that about half of the random sample in 1970 favoured keeping opening hours as they were, and as they still are. But the other half was divided between a larger fraction favouring later closing and a smaller fraction preferring earlier closing. For a liberal democrat the only logical deduction from such a conflict of views is that the more flexible the hours of opening the larger the number of people who would get what they want.<lb/>
It is only in politics that we think it right for majorities constantly to impose their will on minorities. In the market place, of which I am known to be an admirer, it is minorities that rule the roost all the time. Except for monopoly services such as the letter post, telephones, gas or electricity, almost everything we buy and where we choose to buy it reflects our individual preferences. In the cars we drive, in the clothes we wear, in the food we eat, we are all minorities. We would be voted down if we had to carry a democratic majority with us on every line of consumption.<lb/>
I do not deny that all freedom is capable of abuse. We should, every one of us, be concerned that there are approaching 50,000 cases of drunken driving, but that remains a minute fraction of the 2&#x00BD; million serious offences recorded by the police in a recent year. Although no more than 0&#x00B7;004 per cent. of men are treated for alcoholism, we all know of others who are at risk. But the Erroll Report confirms our everyday observation that there is no simple correlation between excessive consumption and the number of hours that pubs are open, especially when drink can be so easily obtained for consumption at home. This lesson has not been disproved by experience in Scotland since the law was liberalised in 1976 and is upheld by evidence from places as far apart as Sweden or Australia, where severe restrictions on hours have not checked abuse. Nothing in the interesting sociological speculations of the noble Earl, Lord Minto, linked more flexible hours with proven excess. In the end he seemed to me to fall back into agnosticism.<lb/>
I believe that we cannot make people better by legislation. That is the task for teaching, preaching, personal example, and in the last resort enforceable laws against anti-social behaviour. It is clearly not a sin to drop in at the local. Indeed, no less an authority than the Director of the Christian Economic and Social Foundation, the Reverend George Brake, recently urged the need to preserve the place of the pub, which he thought,
<quote>"the most favourable controlled environment for the consumption of alcohol".</quote>
He added that,
<quote>"the well-managed public house provides a convenient controlled environment for drinking and is to be preferred to the uncontrolled situations in which drinking takes place at the present time".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0211"/>
<col>405</col>
If the licensing laws were abolished, as I would wish, no pub would be required to open for more hours. Some pubs in some areas would no doubt preserve the present arrangements, while others elsewhere on some days or at some times of the year would open longer and later. The Erroll Report quotes the licensing authorities in London as granting 64,000 extensions in 1970, while a sample of 29 petty sessional divisions gave 28,000 exemption orders for an average of between an hour and an hour and a half of extra opening.<lb/>
No wonder the witnesses petitioning the Erroll Committee in favour of almost completely relaxing the law included the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police, as well as tourist boards and various catering and hotel organisations. There were of course then, as there will be again, familiar lobbies in favour of tighter controls. The question is: who will speak for the millions of unorganised consumers?<lb/>
I would argue that, whether any one of us would personally wish to take advantage of more flexible hours, we should not stand in the way of removing restrictions upon others with different preferences. Opening hours are no more a matter for majorities to override minorities than the times at which cinemas, restaurants or shops ply their trade between willing buyers and willing sellers. The contract that is implicit in a free society is that, even where our emotions are involved, we respect the choices, even the whims, of our fellowmen as a condition for having our own differing tastes and values tolerated by others. If we admit that all freedoms are subject to abuse, we must acknowledge the need for penalties where excess may harm others. But such possibilities do not in my view justify the condescending paternalism, however well-intentioned, that tries to impose a selective morality by the crude, insensitive steamroller of statutory prohibition.</membercontribution></p>

As several noble Lords have pointed out, as long ago as 1970 the Erroll Committee reported on the situation. Thirteen years later, the situation has changed radically and new licensing laws are needed as a result of further consideration, especially to deal with the inconsistencies in the law to which reference has been made by various noble Lords. The noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, made reference to a report from the Justices' Clerks' Society, which I have also received. It is a very valuable report called <i>Licensing Law in the Eighties.</i> As she will know, being a magistrate like myself&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

and Wales. In the early days they may have had whiskers and so on, but now their ideas are very much up-to-date and they have on many occasions provided those who need such information with reports which are well worth scrutiny.<lb/>
On the subject we are considering, I think we should ask what criteria we should look for in the matter of opening hours of public houses. If we refer to the incidence of the effects of alcohol, we are told that the times of opening and the duration of opening are not the main factors. That may be so, but surely the supply and consumption of alcohol and its effects need to be considered comprehensively with other means of procurement and consumption. We should also look at the matter, as several noble Lords have said, with an eye to the effect on tourism. Several inconsistencies have been mentioned tonight by noble Lords. Certainly we should have regard to the needs of visitors, both from home and from overseas. Above all, we should see the whole matter in the context of what is generally good for the community at large.<lb/>
In his speech the noble Earl, Lord Minto, made various criticisms of the present situation, some of which were well justified. I notice that the Justices' Clerks' Society points out that alcohol, in combination with other factors, is connected closely with the loss of many working days, with the break-up of or misery within many marriages, and with the commission of criminal offences, as can be seen by the daily court lists.<lb/>
The report seeks to be unbiased with regard to the two sides which have expressed their views, but the fact is that alcohol is a factor of some importance. Alcohol-related illness is increasing rapidly. The Office of Health Economics estimates that there are three million heavy drinkers, some 100.000 problem drinkers and 150,000 alcoholics in England and Wales. The noble Earl, Lord Minto, has mentioned some of these problems. There is also a big increase in drink-related offences by young people. There needs to be some tightening up of the controls on the sale and consumption of alcohol by minors. There is need for more home influence and for more teacher influence. All this should be dealt with in the social context.<lb/>
If I may consider that aspect, there is no doubt that for many minors the public house is what the youth club and the coffee bar used to be. In many rural and other communities, public houses provide a centre for fellowship and a meeting place, especially for younger people. I have mentioned tourism. We are well aware of the importance of tourism to our country. Conversely, we are also well aware of what we should be offering to tourists who come here from abroad. A number of opinion polls have indicated that a majority of people, especially in the 20 to 30 age group, are in favour of reform.<lb/>
On the matter of licensing hours, any poll is likely to come up with the suggestion that licensing hours should be extended and that people should be allowed to drink what they like when they like. There are other considerations. It is quite clear that if there is no control over closing time and somebody is drinking at 11 o'clock at night the licensee may have to stand around for many hours while a very small amount of alcohol is consumed. This can be detrimental to the viability of the establishment and may have an effect

upon the staff. But there is a need for us to review the licensing laws in order to get rid of some of the inconsistencies which have been mentioned, and to bring about a greater degree of standardisation throughout the country.<lb/>
With regard to licensing hours, the factor of availability includes the number of outlets and the price. There is need for effective control by means of licensing laws and, therefore, for more action&#x2014;sometimes by the police and by other agencies. There are many problems, including the absence of national standards for licensing committees and the fact that many registered clubs are not strictly controlled. There is a laxity of proper control, under Section 77 of the Act, and also a lack of control, in many cases, of under-age drinking. There is need for public awareness of the effects of alcohol in a number of ways.<lb/>
With regard to the particular aspect under review this evening&#x2014;the permitted hours of licensed premises&#x2014;although the noble Lord, Lord Spens, and other noble Lords have advocated flexible opening hours there appears to be no proof that the public generally wants or needs such a revision. As we know, there would be the problem of monitoring and of checks by the police, especially when the permitted hours of opening varied from those of other licensed premises in any particular licensing area. Because of the increase in the number of registered clubs, discos and other licensed premises, there would be the added facility of what one might anticipate would be continuous drinking, with people leaving one establishment and going to another nearby where the hours were rather different from those of the establishment which they had just left; or there would be the possibility of people going to registered clubs to continue their drinking. I am not suggesting that flexibility and the inconsistency of the present laws should not be considered. There may be a case for the permitted hours in registered clubs being the same as the general licensing hours in a particular district, even if they had to be extended to cover some of the anomalies which have been mentioned. There is a case for a more standard approach through the licensing committees.<lb/>
Reference has been made to the departmental report, under the chairmanship of Lord Erroll of Hale, which was published some years ago. Little has been done by successive Governments to bring into effect some or all of the recommendations contained in that report. The fact is that the situation has changed greatly since the report was published. There are more outlets, and the problems connected with alcohol abuse have increased. I believe, therefore, that the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, and others are right to stress the need for a review. Although we should be looking at the need for flexibility in licensing hours I do not believe that we should be looking at that question in isolation from some of the other aspects which should be considered by the licensing committees. However, this is a matter for the next Government. I am pleased to say here and now that my right honourable and honourable friends in the other place, and my noble friends in this House, will take note of what has been said tonight.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01394">8.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01395"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that all noble Lords will agree that we are indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Spens, for providing us with this opportunity to debate a subject of such importance and to examine the issues which it raises. I think this is the first general debate that we have had on the reform of the licensing legislation since 1973, when your Lordships discussed the report of the departmental committee on liquor licensing, under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Erroll of Hale, which was presented to Parliament in 1972. I am sure that those of your Lordships who are familiar with the report will agree with me that it provides an excellent starting point for any consideration of proposals for reforming the licensing law.<lb/>
The committee recommended fundamental changes in the law. Many of its proposals&#x2014;and some of these have been implemented&#x2014;were quite acceptable. The proposals which proved most controversial when the report was discussed in your Lordships' House were those for extending the permitted hours, the fettering of the justices' discretion in the granting of new licences, the lowering of the minimum drinking age and allowing children freer access to public houses. Because of the concern which had been expressed in the debates in your Lordships' House and in another place about the likely effect these proposals would have on alchol misuse, the Government of the day concluded that the report would need to be considered against the background of growing concern about alcoholism and gave an undertaking that such proposals for change as were brought forward would be those which the Government believed to be in the general public interest and generally acceptable to public opinion.<lb/>
There is no doubt, I am afraid, that since 1973 the problem of alcoholism has increased. Estimates vary of the number of problem drinkers in the United Kingdom. The OPCS in 1979 estimated that between 1967 and 1977 the number had increased by 50 per cent.&#x2014;that is, from about 500,000 to 750,000. Others suggest larger or smaller numbers, but all agree generally on the scale of the increase. Most of the other indicators of misuse have also risen very substantially. The social and economic costs of misuse are considerable and it is hardly surprising, therefore, that successive Governments have shown a reluctance to introduce legislation which would make alcohol more readily available.<lb/>
A further factor which has influenced Government thinking has been the findings of a number of influential bodies which have looked in detail at the problems of alcohol misuse and at ways of controlling it. In 1977, the Expenditure Committee in another place and the Government's Advisory Committee of Alcoholism both published reports which, having examined among other things the extent to which availability might be a factor in misuse, stressed that extreme caution should be taken over any relaxation of the licensing law.<lb/>
Since this Government have been in office, we have received many representations from those who would like to see the licensing laws relaxed. At the same time, we have had to meet the costs which fall on the health
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0213"/>
<col>409</col>
and social services which are attributable to alcohol misuse. We concluded that because of our duty to the public, it would be irresponsible to take any initiative in the direction of relaxing the licensing laws in isolation from the wider issues and without regard to our general strategy for helping to prevent alcohol misuse. At the same time, we thought that the issues which had been brought to our notice by the reports to which I have referred should be the subject of informed public debate. To that end, in December 1981 the Health Departments published the discussion document <i>Drinking Sensibly,</i> to which the noble Lord, Lord Spens, referred. The booklet looks at the different issues and the scope for action by both individuals and the Government.<lb/>
Of particular reference to this afternoon's Question are those sections which deal with the relationship between alcohol consumption and harm, and the effectiveness of legal restrictions controlling the availability of alcohol. In deciding to publish the document, the Government hoped that they would promote public discussion of these issues and that the responses would enable sensible decisions to be taken as to whether the licensing law might be reformed, and, if so, how.<lb/>
Having said that, the Government have recognised that the licensing law of England and Wales was in need of reform. The Licensing Act 1964 was a consolidation measure of statutes dating back to the last century. During our period in office, the Government have effected a number of reforms, mainly by assisting Private Members and Members of your Lordships' House to promote legislation which we felt would be useful.<lb/>
For example the Licensing (Alcohol Education and Research) Act 1981 wound up the licensing compensation scheme and enabled &#x00A3;2 million to be allocated for funding alcohol education and research projects under the direction of the Alcohol Education and Research Council, which meets under the chairmanship of my noble friend Lord Windlesham. This Act has also enabled &#x00A3;1 million to be allocated to the Licensed Trades Charities Trust. Most recently, we gave assistance with the drafting of the Licensing (Occasional Permissions) Bill, which was introduced in another place and which was taken through all its stages in your Lordships' House by my noble friend, Lady Trumpington. There have been a number of other measures, and my right honourable friend the Home Secretary has made orders which have almost abolished the system of licensing planning in some parts of the country.<lb/>
My noble friend, Lady Trumpington, referred to recent recommendations of the Justices' Clerks' Society. I can say that these have been received by the department but no conclusions on them have yet been reached. They are receiving careful study, and I can assure both my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, of that; the Government greatly value the society's views. My noble friend Lady Trumpington asked also whether it will be possible to arrange for some special new research programme. That is an interesting suggestion and one of which I shall take note&#x2014;and I shall ensure that my right honourable friend does what he can in that respect.<lb/>
<col>410</col>
At the same time as the other measures to which I have referred, we have been unable to support proposals for making the law more restrictive where, on the evidence available, we have felt doubtful whether such measures would contribute to any reduction in alcohol misuse. That is why we have resisted proposals for restricting the sale of drink by way of wholesale, and the imposition of further restrictions on retail sales in supermarkets. I recognise that the licensed victuallers and the temperance movement, among others, feel strongly about these matters&#x2014;but they have not conclusively proved their case for the imposition of restrictions, which would place substantial burdens on wholesale dealers and retailers. I have given these examples by way of showing that the Government have not been inactive in this area.<lb/>
Turning specifically to the Question on the Order Paper, during the last four years the Home Office has received many representations on the subject from the licensed trade and from other interested organisations. The trade has been particularly worried about the adverse effects which the wider economic recession has had on its profitability, and it believes that the solution lies in its members being permitted to open for longer hours or being able to vary the existing hours so that they attract more custom&#x2014;and this point was expressed by my noble friend Lady Sharples, with her own special expertise in this area. The tourist industry has supported the trade on the grounds that the existing licensing hours are unattractive to tourists&#x2014;a point made by my noble friend Lady Sharples and by the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston. Neither of these arguments should be allowed to influence the decision on this matter. The licensing law exists primary to protect our own society and it is perhaps relevant, and interesting too, that the Home Office has not received a great volume of correspondence from individual members of the public on this matter.<lb/>
The essential difference between the English and Scottish divisions as to the permitted hours lies in the discretion given to the licensing authorities to vary the general permitted hours of opening. Perhaps I ought to declare an interest, coming from that relevatively enlightened part of the world. The prescribed hours of opening in both countries are broadly similar. They allow public houses to open in weekdays between 11.00 a.m. and 10.30 p.m. or 11.00 p.m. with a break or two hours or two and a half hours in the afternoons. The hours on Sunday are shorter but are also broadly the same. Prior to 1976, as your Lordhips will know, Scottish public houses were required to close at 10.00 p.m. and all day on Sundays.<lb/>
In England and Wales, the power of the licensing justices to grant regular extensions is tightly circumscribed. As a general rule, early morning and afternoon extensions may be granted only in the vicinity of markets, and extensions beyond the evening terminal hour are available only where the sale of drink is ancillary to the provision of food or music and dancing.<lb/>
In Scotland, following the reform of the law in 1976, a licensing board has a much wider discretion and may grant extensions for any part of the day in respect of
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0214"/>
<col>411</col>
individual premises if it considers it desirable, having regard to the social circumstances of the locality in which the premises are situated or to activities taking place in that locality. Although it is perhaps arguable that Parliament intended it to be used quite extensively, this power has been widely used to permit Scottish public houses to open during the afternoon break and late at night, particularly in the larger towns and cities. Some boards, however, have adopted a policy of refusing to permit afternoon opening.<lb/>
Provisional assesssments based on surveys carried out in 1976, 1977 and 1978 would seem to suggest that the consumption of alcohol has not been significantly affected by this extension of hours and that those drinking do so at a more leisurely pace. It is interesting that the statistical data on drink-related offences indicate that recent trends show a decrease in offences of drunkenness, and between 1972 and 1982 there has been little variation in offences of drinking and driving. The statistics do not, however, separately identify offences occuring during or immediately following permitted or extended hours.<lb/>
With regard to any increase in alcoholism or other medical problems, the statistical data likewise show that there has as yet been no indication of such adverse effects. The noble Earl, Lord Minto, talked about another survey which had been carried out, but I must say to him that that particular information has not yet been widely publicised or debated. The Government wish to continue to keep all information that comes to hand under review as it emerges, and I myself consider that the analysis which the noble Earl made in his very interesting speech was in itself a very worthwhile study. I am sure the Home Office will look at this in great detail.<lb/>
While the evidence relating to Scotland might suggest that the case for introducing into England and Wales more flexible or extended hours of opening has been proved, I must sound a note of caution. The last survey on the effects of the changes in Scottish licensing hours was carried out in 1978; that is, before afternoon extensions were granted as commonly as they are now. While we think that the Scottish experience so far is encouraging, the Government believe that more time and possibly further research are needed to assess the situation before introducing a similar relaxation into the law of England and Wales.<lb/>
I recognise that the reply I have given to this Question may come as a disappointment to the noble Lord, Lord Spens, and also to the Licensed Victuallers and others who wish to see the law amended in the way the noble Lord, Lord Spens, and others have suggested. The Government are not insensitive to their views, but, as I have indicated, in considering any proposals to relax the licensing law we must first consider them in relation to our general strategy for helping to prevent alcohol misuse. If it is a crumb of comfort to the noble Lord, Lord St. John, and the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, both of whom have made powerful speeches this evening, we have not closed the door on the possibility of longer licensing hours, but we wish to be assured that opening it wider will not lead to an increase in the problem. The
<col>412-414</col>
noble Lord, Lord Spens, has, however, provided us with an opportunity for debating the subject, and for this I know we are all very grateful.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01397"><member>Lord Underhill</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01398">Whether they will explain their approval of the transfer of the harbour assets of Sealink UK Limited, to its subsidiary company Sealink Harbours Limited (as reported in Commons <i>Hansard,</i> 15th April), in view of the categorical assurance by the Lord Bellwin, then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, on 4th June 1981 (col. 1401), that the shipping and harbours of Sealink would be kept together as a single company.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01399"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member>: Under Section 2 of the Transport Act 1981, the Railways Board was required to secure that Sealink UK Limited formed the "harbours company". Section 2 also required Sealink UK Limited to make within three months a scheme for the transfer of the harbour assets to the harbours company, and provided for the scheme to be approved by the Secretary of State. Sealink Harbours Limited was duly formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sealink UK Limited, and the scheme transferring the assets to it was made and approved. As my noble friend Lord Bellwin explained at Third Reading (15th July 1981; col. 1239), there would be nothing to prevent the Railways Board selling the harbours company separately from the shipping business, but the two companies have commercial linkages which provide a strong incentive for keeping them together.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01441"><member>Viscount Eccles</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do not the figures given by the Minister mean that the cost of administering this scheme will be much more than the wretched amounts which a few authors receive?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01442"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I appreciate what my noble friend is saying. I would ask him to wait and see what the first distributions will be, and on that we can judge whether or not we shall have to increase the amount.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01443"><member>Lord Vaizey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend possibly say what the cost of administration is as a proportion of the total amount to be expended&#x2014;because he must be aware that many of us believe that the complexities of this administration are entirely designed to benefit those who administer the scheme and not those who are intended to benefit from it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01444"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that we must wait until the first year of the scheme is completed before we can make our judgments. I very much hope that what my noble friend is saying will not, in fact, be proved accurate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01445"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may come to the Minister's aid. Is it not the case that the cost of the scheme will gradually reduce and that this development will be of great advantage to authors in future?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01446"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, indeed, that is so. Again, until we have seen the first year's operation we cannot honestly say whether it will be a good distribution or whether we shall have to put more into the fund.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01447"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, have Her Majesty's Government calculated the potential number of beneficiaries of this scheme and what proportion of that total figure do the 5,000 authors who my noble friend mentioned in his Answer represent?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01448"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend will be aware, in point of fact the total amount available is &#x00A3;2 million. So if he wishes to divide the 5,000 into that he can do so. But we still have to take the number of books and editions into account.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Nuclear Weapons in the UK: Dual control</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01451">2.46 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01452"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01453">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01454">To ask Her Majesty's Government what discussions have been held or are contemplated with the United States Government regarding control of nuclear devices in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01455"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the understanding between the British and United States Governments, summarised in the joint communiqu&#x00E9; of 1952, about the use of United States nuclear weapons systems based in this country, has been reaffirmed by the Prime Minister and by the President of the United States. The Government have satisfied themselves as to the effectiveness of this understanding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01456"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Lord the Minister for his reply. Nevertheless, is he aware that there is still some apprehension regarding this particular policy pursued by both Governments? Can he tell the House what actual arrangements take place to ensure that the installation of these nuclear weapons is safe and that as far as possible any possibility of accident is removed? What consultations take place with regard to the land that is taken over for these weapons to be installed? Thirdly, can the noble Lord please tell the House what progress has been made on achieving the dual key procedure in the event of real hostilities in which those weapons could be used?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01457"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the security of the missiles will be the responsibility of a jointly manned United States-United Kingdom force under British and United States commanders. They will be responsible for the security of the missiles at all times, whether on base or dispersed. I think that that answers both the first two supplementary questions of the noble Lord. As regards his final supplementary question, I repeat a reply which I have given on previous occasions in your Lordships' House: a full dual key arrangement rests upon ownership of the missiles, and Her Majesty's Government were certain that in this case ownership was not necessary and would involve the expenditure of money which could be put to better use elsewhere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01458"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord the Minister say whether the first agreement has been amended in any form because of the variation in the kind of weapons which are intended as a deterrent and which will probably come into use?</membercontribution></p>
<col>420</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01459"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I quoted the agreement in a short debate which took place on an Unstarred Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Putney, and that is the agreement that we have today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01460"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from the noble Lord's Answer to the first Question, would we be right to assume that, in fact, the Prime Minister is expecting to discuss this subject with President Reagan at the forthcoming Summit?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01461"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. As I said in my original Answer, the matter was reaffirmed by the Prime Minister and by the President of the United States in 1981. Therefore, I do not expect it to be discussed at Williamsburg.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01462"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord the Minister aware that no exercises whatever have taken place in this matter, and that a single exercise would reveal that in an emergency operational control is the only thing that could make these missiles safe?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01463"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if exercises have not taken place, as the noble Lord says, it is because the policy of deterrence works and has worked for nearly 40 years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01464"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister of State confirm to the House that the Government have never proposed to the United States that there might be a dual key without our buying the missiles?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01465"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is the case. I have already given the reason in the questions and answers this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01466"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that it is not a question as to whether we are satisfied or whether the Americans are satisfied with the arrangements? The question is whether the Russians are satisfied with the arrangements, because if the Russians see American-controlled weapons here they may think it is safer to take them out, and that would be very unfortunate for us.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01467"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is why it is important that I should make it clear for about the umpteenth time that the use of these weapons is subject to joint decision, and therefore the Russians should not be tempted to make a move. It would be disastrous for them as well as for other human beings in Europe.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01468"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister whether the Government seriously believe that in the emergency of a war situation in which America was involved, America would delay for discussions before using its nuclear weapons in this country? Secondly, may I ask a question I have asked before and to which I have not received a reply: In view of the fact that America has its reserve headquarters for Europe and this country at High Wycombe, how could the Government possibly control the actions of that centre with its missiles in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01469"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to both the noble Lord's questions is in this way: the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0218"/>
<col>421</col>
understanding of 1952 in effect means that the use of nuclear weapons in this country and from this country is due to joint decision. Both the Prime Minister and the President have reviewed this understanding in 1981, and both are satisfied that it works well. It is an understanding about which all Governments for over 30 years have come to the same conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01470"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord not aware that there are situations developing in Southern America and other parts of the world that could, not inconceivably, cause a clash between the Soviet Union and the United States of America which would not necessarily involve Great Britain? There could be a loosing of nuclear weapons. Would there be then the possibility of a situation arising of United States' nuclear weapons on our soil being used against an enemy with whom we are not at war? Therefore, in these circumstances would the noble Lord agree that the tiny chink of light which has come from Mr. Andropov's proposals ought now to be pursued as that is the only possible way in which we might prevent the possibilities that I have outlined becoming a terrible reality?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01471"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the event of a situation which the noble Lord has described, the use of nuclear weapons from British soil would still be subject to joint political decision under the 1952 agreement. So far as the proposals put forward by Mr. Andropov are concerned, those will be, I have no doubt, discussed in the correct forums at Geneva.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01472"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that, on the eve of an election where the Prime Minister is claiming that Britain stands on her own feet and is respected in the world, we have a situation where, although there is a joint decision on cruise and other missiles, there are no joint operational checks? Can the noble Lord imagine a situation in the United States where allied missiles were fired only by the British and not by operational control with the Americans? Will he recognise the deep concern there is in this country not only on one side but in all parties, where people are most anxious about the need for dual control? Is it not really quite monstrous, when we are allies with the Americans, that we cannot have dual control, because we shall have to pay them rather a high cost to get it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01473"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said to the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, in answer to the first supplementary question, the security of the missiles will be the responsibililty of a jointly manned United States-United Kingdom force under British and United States commanders. That means that we are talking of a joint force working to a common purpose. That is one of the many contributions which this country makes to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. As the noble Lord has mentioned the general election, I hope that the electorate will draw their own conclusions from the proposals of the Opposition that that contribution should be withdrawn from NATO.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01475"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it may be for the convenience of your Lordships if, with the leave of the House, I make a further Statement about the remainder of this week's business. In addition to the business which I announced yesterday, and which is now on the Order Paper, it has been agreed through the usual channels that the following items of business should be taken during the remainder of this week. The following items will be taken after the business already on the Order Paper for Thursday, 12th May: all stages of the Importation of Milk Bill; consideration of Commons amendments to the Dentists Bill [H.L.]; consideration of Commons amendments to the Mental Health (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill [H.L.]; all stages of the Education (Fees and Awards) Bill; all stages of the Local Authorities (Expenditure Powers) Bill.<lb/>
After the business already on the Order Paper for Friday: all stages of the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill; all stages of the Finance Bill; consideration of Commons amendments to the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Bill [H.L.]; Motions for approval of the Northern Ireland Act 1974 (Interim Period Extension) Order; and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (Continuance) Order. In addition, it is possible that the remaining stages of three consolidation Bills may be taken tomorrow.<lb/>
Dinner will be available at 7.30 p.m. tonight, as is usual on a Tuesday. It has been agreed through the usual channels that dinner will not be available on Thursday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01476"><member>Lord Wigoder</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, two queries, if I may. First of all, on the assumption that none of the political parties will wish to meet this Thursday in order to discuss next week's now non-existent business, is there any reason why we should not sit at 2.30 this Thursday rather than at three o'clock? Secondly, could we have offical confirmation that the Data Protection Bill [H.L.] will not now reappear in this House in this Session?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01477"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was not aware that there were to be no party meetings this Thursday, but perhaps we could discuss the time for Thursday through the usual channels. I hope that your Lordships will take it that if there is no further announcement it will be at three o'clock, as it is at the moment on the Order Paper. I understand that the Data Protection Bill [H.L.] will not now return during this Session to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01478"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister assure us that amendments, say, to the Scottish mental health Bill, which I gather was still in Committee at a middling stage this morning in another place, will be readily available so that we can see the cost to the Government of the generosity of the Opposition in allowing this to go through?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01479"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that full discussions have taken place in the usual channels in another place as to exactly what business should proceed in the two Houses this week. I cannot give the

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01502"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when we had our debates in Committee yesterday, I asked the noble Lord about rural development areas. He then explained that they would be designated by the new commission. I asked him to consider the special position of Wales and Scotland and those rural areas in Scotland which are outside the boundaries of the Highlands and Islands Development Board and the rural areas in Wales which are outside the designated boundaries of the Mid-Wales Rural Development Board. In both cases the areas concerned will come under the aegis of the Welsh Development Agency and, in Scotland, under the Scottish Development Agency.<lb/>
The quesion is whether the agencies will be able to designate some of the rural areas in Scotland and Wales outside these boundaries as rural development
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0220"/>
<col>425</col>
areas to receive the benefits of the administration of the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas. I made the point yesterday that these designations of special rural areas in Scotland and Wales were made because of problems which exist in those areas, such as depopulation, high unemployment and so on, which are well known to the House. The rural areas of England are now to receive the benfits of the administration of the new commission, and all that that involves in terms of resources, and CoSIRA operating in these regions able to help new industries to establish there. I want to know from the noble Lord whether, under the new dispensation, these areas of Scotland and Wales&#x2014;where there is unquestionably high unemployment and severe depopulation, in some cases&#x2014;will be able to be designated as rural development areas with all that that means.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 2, leave out lines 3 to 10, and insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("'(1A) Where the evidence available to the arbiter is in his opinion insufficient to enable him to determine the rent properly payable or he is of the view that the open market in rents for comparable subjects in the surrounding area is distorted by scarcity of lets or by other factors, the rent properly payable for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section shall be the rent which he would expect to be paid, in a market which was not affected by such distortion, having particular regard to the following&#x2014;'").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01522">The noble Earl said: When we considered this Bill on Second Reading I explained that both sides of the industry had expressed concern that Clause 2 of the Bill as drafted, which introduces a new formula for determining rent on review, might not achieve one of the main aims of the Bill; that is, to require an arbiter to have regard to the factors additional to open market rents in the surrounding area, as defined in Clause 2, where these open market rents were unrealistically high because of the scarcity of subjects to let.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01523">Your Lordships will recall that I indicated we were re-examining the wording in detail and that we would present an amendment for the consideration of the House in Committee at this stage. The result of this re-examination is that we have produced this amendment to make it quite clear that, if the arbiter is of the opinion that the evidence of open market rents is distorted by scarcity of lets, or by other factors, he shall, in determining the review rent, discount such distortion and have regard to the additional factors which are defined in Clause 2.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01524"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I think this amendment was promised in another place and again promised on Second Reading, so that we now have a chance of seeing exactly what the Government propose. I had hoped that we would also have some reference to the premium factor, or key money. I do not see that key money can be stopped. It is not part of the rent; it is part of the bargain of entry. This was one of the other elements I had hoped to see and I was not alone in that wish. Other people had expected the Government to deal with that.<lb/>
Will the Minister tell us exactly what the change is? He said the amendment meets the point, but we have not had much time to read it. It was not available yesterday. I think I received it a couple of hours ago. It is up to the Minister to let us know what world-shaking change there is here, and I should be grateful

to him for that. We are denied further opportunity of discussion because of the farcical nature of the remaining legislative procedure. Frankly, I think that legislation in the House of Lords is given a far greater importance by the public&#x2014;certainly from the Scottish point of view&#x2014;than I can see in it. There is an element of farce in it.<lb/>
There are quite a number of things in relation to this clause and in relation to rents that we could have raised. I was hoping to have put down some amendments in relation to this and to the things that the Government have ignored in the Northfield Report. It may be that that will be a suitable subject for discussion in the debate on the Question that the clause stand part of the Bill, although I have been well enough brought up in legislation to know that when one speaks on "clause stand part" one speaks on things that are in the clause and not on things that should have been in the clause. The only time properly to do that is when one puts down an amendment and it is discussed. Although the business has been curtailed of necessity, it certainly was not with my agreement that this bargain has been reached in respect of this particular Bill. I view it with very mixed feelings, and I may refer to it at a later stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01525"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: In order to understand the way in which the clause has been amended, one has to read the Bill as we had it on Second Reading with the amendment. The difficulty was to enjoin the arbiter to have regard to the four factors which we conceive on lines 10 to 25 of page 2 of the Bill and at the same time, while he must take an objective test of those factors, to disregard the scarcity (if it exists) of subjects to let in the particular geographical area in which he is working. We had it on good advice&#x2014;and this was confirmed by both sides of the industry agreeing&#x2014;that as paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Clause 2 was drafted, there was a real danger that the arbiter was being enjoined to disregard scarcity which was precisely the opposite of the effect which was intended. Therefore, this amendment in those circumstances came to be drafted in the way it has been drafted. The effect of it is that the arbiter will disregard scarcity when he is determining the rent and will confine himself to the four factors which are set out of which probably the most important is sub-paragraph (iii).<lb/>
What I have to say to the Committee is that this is an amendment which has been (as it were) vetted by both sides of the industry. Of course, it is not for them to agree or disagree to legislation; it is for Parliament to do that. But I can tell your Lordships that, in so far as they were asked to signify an opinion of the amendment, they were both in favour of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01526"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: I think it is important to get it right because it is not either House of Parliament which is the last determiner of what is the law, it is the courts. Therefore, we want as much clarity as possible in respect of that. One of the other things that people were concerned about in respect of rents was the actual fact of the evidence to the Northfield Committee. We find it on page 25, although it is stated in more than one place and it is also in the minority recommendation of Mr. Colburn and Mr. Peat&#x2014;and at least one of them was a Scotsman. It reads:
<col>428</col>
<quote>There is some evidence to support the view that the price of land is too high if viewed strictly in terms of its current agricultural earning capacity".</quote>
Of course, it is true that at times rents are being fixed which are not related to the productive capacity of a farm. There seems to be an independent value for the land as opposed to the profitability of the farm.<lb/>
I am glad that the Government made another change in another place in relation to sub-paragraph (iv), which reads:
<quote>"the current economic conditions in the relevant sector of agriculture".</quote>
Originally, I think, the Government had the words, "current economic conditions in agriculture"; whereas, as we all know, there are sectors of agriculture which even at this moment are posing problems and a certain lack of profitability.<lb/>
Did the Government consider the question of the separation that has grown up in respect of the value of land as evidenced by sales and rent as opposed to the productivity capacity of the individual farms that are being rented or being sold? Because of the situation it is too late now to put down any further amendments. The Government seem to think that they have now put right this misunderstanding. I only hope they are right hut, so far as the explanation given by the Minister is concerned, we could read very many things into even the amended version of paragraph (<i>b</i>).</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 2, line 33, leave out from ("subsection") to ("earlier") in line 35, and insert ("is").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01533">The noble Earl said: This is really a drafting amendment but, because it is slightly more than that, I will explain it to the Committee. Clause 2(<i>d</i>) of the Bill provides, by an amendment to Section 7(3) of the 1949 Act, for the substitution of three years for five years as the minimum review period for determination of rent in arbitration. The proviso to Clause 2(<i>d</i>) provides transitional arrangements for the introduction of the three-year rent-review period under which any rent agreed or determined before the commencement of the amending legislation would not be subject to review by arbitration until the end of a five-year period.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01534">In ordinary language, that means that any rent fixed before the new legislation came into effect, on the assumption that it would run for five years, should not be subject to review by arbitration until the end of the five-year period; thereafter the rent review period would be three years. The classes which these transi-

<col>429</col>
tional arrangements were intended to cover, with reference to Section 7(3) of the 1969 Act, were: first, rents agreed on the creation of a new tenancy; secondly, rent changes by agreement or arbitration; and, thirdly, cases in which there had been a direction by an arbiter that a rent should continue unchanged.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01535">We have now established that the Bill as drafted covers the last two of these elements but not the first; that is to say, cases where a new tenancy has been created with an agreed rent less than five years before the commencement of the Act. This amendment corrects the error. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01536"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: We are grateful to the noble Earl for having explained the amendment. Subsection (<i>d</i>) is not the most popular part of the Bill because the rent review in Scotland for a statutory period of five years has now been reduced to three years, so that the tenant farmers in Scotland can look forward to having their rents raised every three years instead of every five years. I know that some of the Liberals were even arguing for this proceeding at our Second Reading stage. I hope that they are now explaining to the tenant farmers in the North of Scotland, particularly round Caithness, how helpful they have been to them in supporting the Government in enabling rents to be raised every three years instead of every five years.<lb/>
The noble Earl the Minister of State was a bit tetchy when I interrupted him during his Second Reading speech&#x2014;I think during his winding-up&#x2014;when he was proclaiming Northfield as the justification for the departure from the five-year period and insisting on three years as it was in England. I pointed out to the noble Earl that the recommendation in Northfield was not unanimous; it was a case of most of the members of the committee thinking the period should be the same as in England&#x2014;three years. That is a fairly important point, especially if the dissenting members of this committee, drawn widely from the United Kingdom, were the Scots. Traditionally we have had a shorter period than in England for rent review. I see no reason why we should not continue with that because farming traditions and a lot of other things are different. I know that is not the point made by this amendment.<lb/>
I hope the noble Earl the Minister will appreciate that we have to speak where we can in respect of this particular Bill. Let him be thankful it is going through in a very hurried way. The important point is that they seek to be fair. Quite apart from the terms of the lease the period is five years by statute, which has now been reduced to three years, and if there has been a decision by an arbiter we should try to ensure that it will not be changed until a certain period. It would be unfair to apply this new power of review in these particular cases.<lb/>
I think what the Government are doing is fair and reasonable. I thank them for having discovered their mistake. As we went through this Bill with the usual toothcomb regarding legislation in your Lordships' House, it might well have been that all the Scots and all the English noble Lords were rushing to take part in it because, after all, they insisted that Scottish legislation should be dealt with here and not in

If the noble Earl cares to go back to the last Parliament he will discover my name applied to a Bill promoting devolution for Scotland. But from this particular point of view, I would have thought that if we had had that kind of close inquiry we might well have discovered this flaw in the Bill&#x2014;who knows what other flaws there are?&#x2014;which will never be noticed until such time as their Lordships in the courts of Scotland decide that what the Bill says is not exactly what the Government meant.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01541"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I should respond briefly. The noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, accuses me of being tetchy last week&#x2014;I think that was his word. If I were tetchy it was because the noble Lord struck what the Americans call a bum note and the sound has not become any clearer over the weekend. The reason for the difference between a three-year and a five-year period as opposed to Scotland and England was that traditionally farm leases in Scotland were longer than those in England. Therefore it came to be that five years was considered a reasonable period for review whereas in England, where they were shorter, a shorter period of three years was considered right.<lb/>
As the noble Lord perhaps knows, in Scotland most, if not all, leases are on tacit relocations, and therefore the old considerations are totally inapplicable. In fact, this was part of the agreement which was, if not welcomed by the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, at least assented to, the reason being that instead of as now, when every five years a tenant can more or less expect to have his rent doubled under what I might call a push-pull principle, now the thing falls to be considered in the future after three years and the ordinary conditions which will prevail at the time of the review will apply. I would ask the Committee to accept that this is probably a more logical and satisfactory way of proceeding.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01545"><member>The Earl of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: It has nothing to do with the cost of living. In the past it has been due to the deplorable attitude shown by the then Labour Government to the farming community. In fact, rents bore no relationship to the cost of living except and in so far as the standard of living in agriculture went down because of the appalling policies exhibited by the then Minister of Agriculture towards the European Economic Community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01546"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: In that case, can the noble Earl tell us why the cost of farms has gone up and up and up even while there was a Labour Government? For the first time, from the 1948 Act onwards, in Scotland the farmers have a sense of security that they never had before, and if the noble Earl wants a lecture on that, may I refer him to what is going to be part of my bible during the Committee stage&#x2014;which has been frustrated by some event announced from Downing Street&#x2014;on land ownership and land use of the Scottish Highlands, which has just come from Aberdeen University.

how it is that so far as leases in existence are concerned&#x2014;and we are now talking about succession&#x2014;there will be no change at all. But, in respect of new leases after the Bill takes effect, which is two months after it receives the Royal Assent, there will be a second class, as it were, of relatives or successors to the tenancy where different considerations will apply so far as a notice to quit is concerned. Of course the cases which are really important are cases 4, 5, 6, and 7&#x2014;although 7, I hazard, is less important than the other three.</membercontribution></p>

I am very sad that the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, and his colleague who spoke on Second Reading are not here, because they had a great deal to say about the 1968 Act. What this Bill does, in Part I of this schedule, is confirm that that Act which they condemned so much still remains in force and is accepted by the Government for all existing tenancies. The change in tenancies will apply only to those which are entered into after 1st January 1984, when new tenants will discover that they have not the same security of tenure, or conditions of tenure, in respect of succession as existed under the 1968 Act. Following the speeches of those two noble Lords from the Liberal Benches, I was hoping to see an amendment down to leave out the first part of this schedule, but evidently their interest did not sustain them quite to that point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01565"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to be grateful to the Minister for his further explanation on Third Reading of the importance of this Bill. When it had its Second Reading in another place the Minister in charge said that the aim of the Bill was to stem the decline in the number of tenant farmers in Scotland and indeed to increase that number. If that was his aim, I notice that the aim put forward by the noble Minister just now is a little bit less optimistic. We just hope that something good will come out of it. I can tell him the good that will come out of it. For the landlords it will be increased rents&#x2014;more frequent periods of review and increased rents. For new tenants entering succession after 1st January, they will not have the security that was afforded by the Labour Government's Act of 1968.<lb/>
It is not so had a Bill as I expected because anyone who knows what happened in connection with the 1956 Act&#x2014;part of which was put right in Scotland, by the way, long before anything was done in England, because it was 1976 before the change was made in England&#x2014;will appreciate just exactly the importance of it.<lb/>
The Minister referred to our confrontations across this Table on Scottish legislation. This is where I think the House of Lords slips up. It has been virtually a dialogue between the noble Minister and myself. I do not call that "close scrutiny of legislation". I think I am right in saying that I occasionally had some help from my noble and learned friend&#x2014;when he sees a point he makes it, as he did today&#x2014;but it really is a bit of a farce if this is to be considered an adequate legislative process for Scotland in relation to matters of very considerable importance. I think the noble Minister has learned over the past two or three years. I remember in his early period I described him as "the master of the infelicitous phrase". He has learned that a little more control of that "tetchiness" of his will get him a little further forward.<lb/>
I have heard reference made to the length of my speeches from this Bench from some noble Lords. Take Second Reading: we had about two speeches from the noble Earl; we had four or five speeches from the Back Benches&#x2014;all from the Tory side&#x2014;and two Liberals spoke. You add up all that time and you will see that I have to make up for it in some way and I think I have been very abstemious in relation to my occupation of this Bench. I certainly look forward to legislation in the next House when the noble Earl is sitting on this side and I am supporting the Minister of State from the other side.<lb/>

<title>Coroners' Juries Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01571">3.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01572"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. It may seem presumptuous of one who has been in your Lordships' House for fewer than four months to be so soon seeking your Lordships' support for legislation. That presumption must be the more compounded when the legislation is concerned with the office of coroner, which dates from the year 1194&#x2013;789 years ago. I can only ask that that presumption be excused.<lb/>
I wish, first, to pay tribute to my honourable friend in another place, Mr. Christopher Price, who introduced this Bill there in April this year. It is true to say that, despite the great age of the system of coroners' courts, there has been disquiet over recent years about a number of aspects of the way in which those courts are run. There has been considerable public disquiet about particular decisions of the courts, but I do not think it is appropriate for me to go into any particular cases.<lb/>
The present position of coroners' juries is that it is not like juries in other courts. In courts, the Juries Act 1974 governs the qualification of persons to serve as jurors in the Crown Court, the High Court and county courts, the summoning of jurors to attend for service and related matters. But there is no such clear indication in legislation of what the position should be for coroners' juries. When a coroner is obliged or desires to summon a jury he:
<quote>"shall, as soon as practicable, issue his warrant for summoning not less than seven nor more than eleven good and lawful men to appear before him at a specified time and place, there to inquire as jurors touching the death"</quote>
of such-and-such a person. I quote from the Coroners Act 1887, Section 3(1). This not only leaves open the issue of whether there should be a jury, although that issue has been somewhat closed by recent amendments to the Administration of Justice Act; it also leaves entirely the issue of how and from whom the coroner's jury shall be selected.<lb/>
The coroner's warrant is directed to the coroner's officer who, in turn, issues summonses to a number of adults sufficient to make up a jury. There is advice from the Home Office about how to use the electoral roll and summon jurors on a random basis, as is the case with other juries, but it is still the case that in some areas coroners' officers do as they think fit. It was suggested in another place that they might go out and take people going to or from meetings of the National Front or the Communist Party.<lb/>
I think we may see that as being somewhat fanciful, but there is evidence that in some parts of the country the coroners' officers, who tend to be police officers, look for retired people who are less likely to seek to be excused, and less likely to make expensive claims for loss of earnings. Of course, the discretion in the hands of the coroner's officer is itself a matter of concern,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0225"/>
<col>435</col>
because, unfortunately, there are deaths in police custody and the idea that a police officer, being a coroner's officer, should have any real discretion about the selection of a jury when the case concerns a death in police custody is worrying, to say the least.<lb/>
There are other things that could be said about coroners and coroners' juries which I do not think it is appropriate to raise in detail. We could&#x2014;and I hope that in a new Parliament we will&#x2014;be talking about legal aid in coroners' courts. We could be talking about the disclosure of police evidence. We could be talking about coroners' courts being held on behalf of the Queen and not on behalf of relatives, so that a wider range of witnesses could be admitted. We could also be talking about civilian coroners' officers, rather than police officers.<lb/>
But we are concentrating now on one thing and one thing alone, which is the constitution of coroners' juries. This Bill follows recommendations in the Brodrick Report of 1971 and in the Select Committee on Home Affairs in another place in 1980. It had the support in another place of the Government. It has the support of the Coroners' Society, whose secretary, Dr. John Burton, I understand agrees with this particular reform, though possibly not with some of the others to which I have referred.<lb/>
The Bill is a short one. Clause 1 is concerned with the qualifications of jurors, and it seeks&#x2014;I shall be extremely brief about this&#x2014;to make the qualifications the same as for other courts, and to make the penalties for misrepresentation or serving on a jury while knowingly being ineligible the same as they would be in other courts. It empowers the appropriate officer&#x2014;that is, the coroner's officer&#x2014;to question people who have been summoned to see whether they are qualified, and it defines the fines which are applicable for offences against the Bill.<lb/>
Clause 2 refers to the extension of the rule-making power, which is concerned entirely in this case with the conditions under which persons may be excused jury service. Again, it seems entirely appropriate that the conditions of being excused for family or business reasons, or for any other appropriate reasons, should be as they are in the courts.<lb/>
Clause 3 is mostly formal, but includes a provision, lest we should be thought to be infringing on the Royal prerogative, that excludes any inquest held by the coroner of the Queen's Household. As noble Lords will know, the coroner of the Queen's Household holds sway in the Royal Palaces and in this Palace of Westminster.<lb/>
As I said, this is a relatively modest and uncontroversial Bill. It is part of a whole series of amendments which might be thought desirable to the system of the coroner's court. But, as it is, I believe that it deserves the support of all Members of your Lordships' House. My Lords. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>436</col>
a Bill in this House. Bills which are thought to be modest and uncontroversial very often turn out to be highly technical and extremely difficult. I remember on one occasion in the Appellate Committee someone submitting to Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest that the point being taken by his opponent was a merely technical point. Lord Morris said "Ah, yes. Very often, what you regard as a mere technical point your opponent has discovered to be an important point of principle." So there are pitfalls in the apparently uncontroversial.<lb/>
This Bill has, as my noble friend said, received support from sources well qualified to express a view from experience and knowledge of these matters, and certainly it has our support. I confess however that I think this is a classic case for early consolidation. No fewer than four Acts of Parliament are referred to in the Bill. We start with the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926. Then there comes a reference to the need to amend the Coroners Act 1887. Next there is the Juries Act 1974 and finally the Criminal Justice Act 1982. In relation to the Juries Act 1974, one reads:
<quote>"If a person serves on a jury knowing that he is ineligble for such service under Group A. B or C in Part I of Schedule 1 to that Act he shall he guilty of an offence".</quote>
All that is very bewildering, and clearly it is somewhat meaningless in some ways&#x2014;on a first reading, at any rate.<lb/>
I wonder whether it is intended to explain to the person who is to be summoned to the jury what it is that he must be sure of before he serves. Group A is fairly simple. Members of the judiciary are ineligible for service. So also are other persons concerned with the administration of justice, the clergy, the mentally ill and a group of persons disqualified under Part II. This group includes those who have served any part of a sentence of imprisonment or detention for a term of three months or more.<lb/>
This is not a very satisfactory way of proceeding with legislation. Therefore I greatly hope that after it has gone through the House the Bill will be an early candidate for consolidation. If the noble Lord, Lord Renton, were here I am sure we should hear complaints in far more eloquent terms than I have expressed about the need for consolidation. Subject to that point, we on this side of the House give our support to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01575">3.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01576"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, for the very helpful speech he has made and for sponsoring what we all agree is a very useful Bill. As your Lordships have heard, the Bill will implement a recommendation made by the Brodrick Committee as long ago as 1971. It is a useful measure and one that is welcomed by the Government. One of the reasons which has traditionally been given for differentiating the coroner's jury from other juries has been that the coroner's jury may have to be called together in haste. That was indeed the case when at one time the only statute governing the matter was the Coroners Act 1887, Section 3 of which requires the coroner to have his jury summoned "as soon as practicable".<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0226"/>
<col>437</col>
However, Section 13(2) of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926 enabled the coroner to open an inquest without a jury, subsequently adjourning it and summoning the jury rather more at leisure, so that there is nowadays no reason why that jury should not be selected in exactly the same way and by the same means as juries in other courts. That is what the Bill will achieve. Clause 1(1) of the Bill, by applying to coroners' jurors the same qualifications and disqualifications as already apply to jurors in other courts under the Juries Act 1974, will enable the selection of coroners' juries to be made at random from the electoral roll.<lb/>
It is intended that if the Bill becomes law, administrative arrangements should be made for this to be done by the same machinery as in other courts. Selection of jurors will therefore no longer rest with the coroner's officer, as at present. The clause goes on to create a number of new offences&#x2014;new, that is, in relation to coroners' jurors, since they and the associated fines are identical with those which the Juries Act 1974 applies to jurors in other courts. The clause also provides for the coroner to authorise a person to question, or cause to be questioned, any person summoned to serve on a coroner's jury to establish whether the person is in fact qualified to serve as a juror.<lb/>
Clause 2 extends the rule-making power in Section 26 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926 under which the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor makes procedural rules in relation to inquests. This will enable those provisions of the Juries Act 1974 which relate to the excusal of jurors to be applied to coroners' jurors. Although these rules are made by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, I understand that he is advised in this matter by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary who has a general responsibility for the law under which coroners work.<lb/>
Clause 3 gives the short title of the Bill, and provides that if it becomes law it shall come into force on a day to be appointed by the Secretary of State. I have already referred to the administrative arrangements which have to be made for the selection of coroners' jurors by the machinery used in other courts. It would take a month or two to apply that machinery to coroners' juries, to make the new rules I have mentioned and to promulgate the arrangements to all those concerned. It is envisaged that the rules will come into force on the same day as that appointed by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Act to come into effect.<lb/>
Clause 3 also removes from the Coroners Act 1887 a disqualification which has become redundant since it is now covered by the disqualifications in the Juries Act 1974, and provides that the Bill, if it becomes law, will not apply to any inquest begun before it comes into force, or to any inquest held by the coroner of Her Majesty the Queen's Household. The Bill applies only to England and Wales.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, asked about the possibility of a consolidation measure. I should like to follow this up with a letter to the noble and learned Lord on the matter. As I understand it,
<col>438</col>
there is the possibility of introducing further legislation in due course, taking into account the recommendations of the Brodrick Committee before any further consolidation measures come into effect.<lb/>
Until yesterday I had fully expected that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, and I would not be so fully in accord over another rather larger Bill which was to have been before your Lordships' House this afternoon, so it is with much pleasure that on behalf of the Government I welcome this Bill whose aims the Government fully support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01577"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, may I ask him, regarding the question put to him by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, concerning consolidation, whether the Government could possibly think up more excuses for avoiding consolidation than the one he has just promulgated, because the excuse which is always given is that there is more legislation in the pipeline and this is the wrong time to consolidate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01578"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that I cannot fully respond to my noble friend's point about consolidation. I should like to seek advice and talk to him about it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01584"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill do now pass. In doing so, I must express my appreciation to the Government and to the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, for the welcome they have given to the Bill. I am particularly gratfule to the noble Lord for making it clear that the Government will attempt to simplify the introduction to the Bill by simplifying the dates provided for in Clause 3. We are already indebted to the Government for another matter; namely, the institution of rules by the Attorney General for juries in other courts, whereby the procedures drawn up by the Royal Statistical Society for the random selection of jurors from the electoral roll have been brought into force by this Government. Since it is the last week of this Government, it would seem churlish not to say so before they vanish into oblivion.<lb/>
My noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn Jones referred to the necessity for consolidation. Although I sympathise with him, it would be sad if we were to lose some of these splendid words which appear in the 1887 legislation. I should hate to lose from the statute book the words:
<quote>"good and lawful men"</quote>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0227"/>
<col>439</col>
as applied to coroners' juries. And since the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, referred to the Telecommunications Bill, I have a particular affection for another 1887 Act, which crops up in the Telecommunications Bill, and that is the Military Tramways Act. Again, that is something that I would be sad to see being lost from the statute book.<lb/>
I wish to mention just one other point, which concerns the disqualification of jurors. Some noble Lords may have been puzzled by the proposal in this Bill to remove the disqualification of prison officers under certain circumstances. The reason for that is that there occurs in existing legislation for other types of juries a general disqualification in respect of prison officers. I felt it was necessary to refer to that in case this proposal was thought to be a step backwards rather than a step forward. These, however, are minor points. I am grateful to both noble Lords who have spoken and I beg to move that this Bill do now pass.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01593">Clause 1 [<i>Prohibition of female circumcision</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01594"><member>Lord Hunter of Newington</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 1, line 7, after ("person") insert ("for ritual, cultural or traditional reasons").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01595">The noble Lord said: With this amendment, Clause 1(1)(a) will read as follows:
<quote>"to excise, infibulate or otherwise mutilate any part of the labia majora or minora or clitoris of any person for ritual, cultural or traditional reasons",</quote>
making it quite clear that this is something different from normal medical practice. I apologise for not being present at Second Reading, but I have read <i>Hansard</i> carefully and have noted the wide agreement for and unaminity towards the purposes of this Bill. I also noted that there has been a good deal of discussion about ways in which this Bill might be improved. I wonder whether this modification will clarify the position because, as the Bill is drafted, matters are dealt with the other way around. To clarify this point, I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01596"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunter of Newington, is of course the reason for this Bill; in broad terms, the Bill exists to prevent precisely that which is described in his amendment. But I wonder whether it is fair to the courts to move these words into the Bill. Let us just think what might
<col>440</col>
happen if a prosecution is brought. The court has to decide whether the reason for the operation is ritual, cultural or traditional. An argument is then bound to develop between the prosecution and the defence as to what is enjoined by the culture or tradition of the patient and what is not enjoined by the culture or tradition of the patient; and about what the ritual commonly practised in the patient's homeland is and what it is not. I wonder whether that is a firm enough basis on which to expect a court to pass judgment. The rituals, cultures and traditions of the peoples where this operation is endemic are continuously changing. The evidence brought before the court might be out of date, or it might be held that it was out of date. The argument would shift onto even shakier sands.<lb/>
This is why, when drafting this Bill in the first place, I thought that I should try to avoid subjective words such as "cultural" or "traditional" and try simply to define an action that was to be illegal unless certain defined persons declared positively that it was for the health of the patient. I still believe that it is better that way around. It will be more easily argued before the courts that way around. I hope therefore that, having heard the other side of the argument, the noble Lord, Lord Hunter of Newington, will agree that his amendment can be dispensed with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01597"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: While appreciating the purpose of this amendment I support the objections made by the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, because my reading of this amendment is that it will weaken the Bill. The amendment tries to define three reasons for female circumcision, but there may be many more, and different words may be used. I can think, for example, of "religious" reasons. Such reasons might be covered by "cultural", but then they might not be.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, drafted this Bill in order to avoid any ambiguity and any cultural offence, I suggest that by selecting these three terms&#x2014;although I fully admit that they are the main terms which could be held to cover virtually all the causes&#x2014;there is the danger that, in a court of law, other words could be used which might not be legally covered by the three terms included in the proposed amendment. For that reason, this amendment will weaken this Bill and I do not believe that any member of this Committee wishes to do that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01598"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: If I may, I should like to say a few words at this point about the Government's position. As the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has said, the way he has constructed his Bill is to prohibit all operations on these parts of the female anatomy and then to provide certain savings in terms of medical necessity. The Government have a good deal of sympathy for the line proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunter of Newington, because, if for no other reason, it means that the somewhat draconian policing arrangements which are called into play by Clauses 2 and 3 of this Bill will not then be necessary.<lb/>
I recognises that the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has softened, or proposes to soften, those arrangements quite considerably. All the same, I am tempted to prefer the line proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunter of Newington. Indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, knows, the Government have been consid-
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0228"/>
<col>441</col>
ering whether it would be possible to table our own amendments to achieve this purpose. I am sorry that, in the helter skelter of the weekend, this has not proved possible, although considerable efforts were made.<lb/>
The Government position, then, is that while we are generally neutral to the individual amendments which now come before your Lordships, we certainly endorse the essence of that which is proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, in that we ought to put beyond any doubt that this procedure is unlawful. Having said that, I will leave the detailed consideration of these amendments to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01599"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: I utterly reject this amendment. It does nothing to improve the Bill which the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has so courageously brought forward and which will make history at this time. To talk about the cultural attitude towards it does not make that attitude good; it still remains cruel and ignorant, and there is nothing to be said in its favour. The fact is that there are certain cultural customs that are not to be admired. With regard to its being traditional, if something is traditional and it is bad, do we have to go on with it? I have never heard of such a thing. It simply does not make sense at all. So I hope that neither the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, nor any of us will accept this amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01600"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: This is a very difficult and sensitive problem and I think we all appreciate how the noble Lord, Lord Hunter, and the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, have endeavoured to meet it. On balance, however, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hunter, will not press his amendment. It seems to me we can only legislate here for the courts of this country, and how difficult it is going to be for the courts of this country if we put before them judgments which have to be made on the ritual, cultural or traditional reasons which are extant in other countries. I feel that is putting an onus on the courts that would be most impractical and most unfair, and, while appreciating the motives for it, I very much hope the noble Lord. Lord Hunter, will not press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01601"><member>Lord Hale</member><membercontribution>: I had not intended to intervene. I have much sympathy with what the noble Baroness, Lady Gaitskell, said. It is 40 years since I was in Kenya and was made aware of this practice, which applied in certain tribes and not in others so far as one could know, and particularly in the Kikuyu tribe, where it was a common practice in those days to see the woman of the household, often the grandmother, walking in front carrying an enormous sack, posho, on her head, and the young grandson smoking a cigarette and walking 20 yards behind. At that time Lady Summerskill wrote to me and asked if women's rights were looked after in the colonies I was visiting, and I gave her a very strong indication of this practice which appeared to have no possible explanation at all, except the enslavement of women by the deprivation of any form of sexual temptation. I do not know what we can do by legislation, except in this country; but one could at least perhaps think of trying to do something by education in other areas. It is an important subject; it is one that everyone has taken seriously and I know
<col>442</col>
this House is anxious so to do. It is a very vicious practice.<lb/>
May I just say one thing about our courts dealing with the terms of Lord Hunter's amendment. Only two or three days ago I was reading a brief account of A. J. P. Taylor's article on the criminal libel case in which the title of the criminal libel was <i>The Cult of the Clitoris.</i> He says that in the course of that stormy trial, which had juries going mad and judges beyond control&#x2014;and Mr. Justice Darling is one of the 47,000 people in the black book who have been accused as a spy&#x2014;the judge confessed, and the Director of Public Prosecutions added, that neither of them knew what the clitoris was and had never heard of it before the case. This was regarded apparently as an even graver circumstance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01605"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilion</member> moved Amendment No. 2.
<quote>Page 1, line 12, after ("fine") insert ("or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01606">The noble Baroness said: For the convenience of the Committee, I would like to take amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together. These amendments, if agreed, will mean that if a person is guilty of an offence the possibility of a prison sentence will be included in the Bill, in Amendment No. 2 on conviction on indictment, and in Amendment No. 3 on summary conviction. These amendments will place female circumcision clearly within the context of Section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. I have spoken to many people from all walks of life who have been shocked that female circumcision for non-medical reasons has taken place in this country. All people with whom I have discussed this Bill feel that a fine is not a strong enough disincentive to stop this practice from taking place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01607">If medical doctors are found guilty of an illegal practice they can be struck off the medical register by the General Medical Council. But how do we know there are not witch doctors and other people who might be interested in performing this mutilation? We live in a very complex, mixed society.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01608">I have looked up the Offences Against the Person Act 1961. The section that covers bodily harm and intent to wound does not say anything about the performing of these acts with the consent of a parent. This is why I think we want a clear Act of Parliament which prohibits female circumcision for non-medical reasons. It is an extraordinary custom. If the Bill does not include the penalty of imprisonment it is lessening existing legislation, which I am sure is not the intent of this Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01609">My interest is to protect children and young people who sometimes are in the hands of parents or grandparents who, because they have been circumcised, think the next generation should suffer the same
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0229"/>
<col>443</col>
fate. It is a vicious circle of custom. Anyone who heard the cries of the children who had undergone the agonies of this mutilation must surely agree. If we legislate it is important to make it clear that these people taking part in performing or subjecting their children to this vile practice are at risk of going to prison. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01610"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: The Bill as drafted does, of course, create an offence, and in order to put it beyond doubt that that is a criminal offence it does provide a penalty on conviction. The amendment only increases the penalty on conviction. We may want to do that in order to express a greater abhorrence of the practice concerned than would otherwise be the case. We may want to do it because we are trying to put it beyond doubt in the wake of the 1861 Act, which has not been applied to those who have committed these atrocities in this country. In that case we should want a prison sentence.<lb/>
On the other hand there is this consideration. If we are talking about medically qualified people&#x2014;a doctor, surgeon, or a nurse for that matter&#x2014;who is convicted of the crime created by this Bill, that person is ruined. The professional bodies will not smile on his future career even if he is only fined. The disgrace should be sufficient to deter him from doing it again. Then we come, as the noble Baroness said, to the unqualified person&#x2014;the "witch doctor" or the back street barber-type semi-trained midwife&#x2014;who may not be deterred by a fine. We could say, as a counter argument, that she will be charging a great deal less than a surgeon, by definition, and that is why she gets the work. No one likes insanitary operations for their own sake. Therefore, she will be doing it quite a lot if she is to afford the kind of fine that is already in the Bill.<lb/>
There are many pros and cons. I have not even mentioned overcrowding in prisons and the general considerations of penal reform. In short, it is an issue on which I, as the simple layman introducing the Bill, find it impossible to have an opinion. This is where I believe it would be helpful if the Government could tell us what, in their view, would be the best sort of penalties to have in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01611"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I fear I cannot go that far, but I can say that I think it is important that the penalties provided for in this Bill are the sort of penalties that one would receive for comparable offences under other legislation and also that the penalties provided in the Bill are appropriate for the courts in which the offences will come to be tried, should that happen.<lb/>
It is not certain that we have achieved that, either in the drafting of the Bill as originally presented or, indeed, in this clause as it might be amended by the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness. I should like to reserve the Government's position on that, but I cannot think that this is a matter of great substance standing between the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, and myself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01612"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a few words in support of the amendments. The way that society relates to and views a particular crime is very much represented by the measure of punishment
<col>444</col>
which is doled out for that crime. At present we have and awful lot of offences which draw a fine. We are all liable to a fine most days. We park our cars for five minutes too long somewhere and attract a fine. Someone who is fined for an offence is socially completely acceptable, but someone who has been imprisoned for an offence is not socially acceptable. It is quite a different degree of punishment. There is a great divide between the offence of parking one's car for five minutes too long and someone who performs this operation. In my view, therefore, it is important to show that society views this particular crime as serious by adding to the Bill that it should be an imprisonable offence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01613"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: I find it impossible to support this amendment on the ground that one should not invent new reasons for sending people to prison when informed opinion is perfectly clear that, first, it does not do them any good when one has done so, and, secondly, that it does not act as a deterrent to people who do not understand our mode of thought.<lb/>
The technical people, such as doctors or nurses, as has already been agreed, would be properly punished by their own trade unions, so to speak, if convicted of such an offence. The less educated, less sophisticated, or, if you like, more ritually devoted people will not be affected in any way by being sent to prison. It is an entirely inappropriate sentence for either a priest who is doing something because he believes it is God's will or for a mother who is doing something because it happened to her mother. I believe it to be absolutely misguided at this stage to introduce imprisonment as a punishment for something which we all believe should be severely punished. It is our duty, and we are happy to support it, that the operation should be made illegal in this country, but not to the extent of imprisonment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01614"><member>Baroness Hornsby-Smith</member><membercontribution>: I support my noble friend Lady Masham of Ilton. I do not think that many English, or should we say Anglo-Saxon, horn doctors are likely to be inclined to pursue this type of operation. It is not unnatural to think that those who have been born and bred in a country where female circumcision was normal practice, who have qualified and come to practise in this country and whose whole environment and culture has accepted it as reasonable practice, are more likely to be the doctors who would perform these operations.<lb/>
They are not likely to perform them in a National Health Service hospital. If a very strong-minded father or mother, with the old cultures instilled in them, wish it done to their daughters they are likely to pay for it privately, and perhaps quite heavily. To pay out a fine they will lose no face, but if they are sent to prison I am sure it will do more to bring home throughout the country that we do not accept this mutilation of women who are operated on where there is no medical need; that we do not accept it and that we are not prepared to accept it.<lb/>
I think it should be for the courts to decide whether a fine or imprisonment is appropriate. However, I do not believe that a fine will bring home the depth of disgust and revulsion that we have towards this practice in the same way as sending people to prison.
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0230"/>
<col>445</col>
Many of these people, particularly those who are well established and seeking to maintain their old ideas and cultures, will be quite ready and prepared to pay considerable sums of money to have this operation performed. A fine will mean nothing. The courts should have the power to decide what the penalties should be and, however short a term of imprisonment, this will bring home the gravity of the crime far more than a fine ever could.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01615"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: I support both the amendments of the noble Baroness and I do so for two reasons. However, before I give them may I appeal to fellow Members of this House not to use the term "witch doctor" as it has been used. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about this term. Indeed, in many parts of the world what is better termed as traditional medicine is now recognised, and co-operated with, by what we might call modern or scientific medicine.<lb/>
The two reasons that I believe can be adduced in favour of these amendments are, first, that it will strengthen and more clearly define the very passionate statement which was made to us by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor on the Second Reading of the Bill. He stated quite categorically that this operation was an offence under present law. One reason for this Bill is to make this quite clear, and it will only be made clear if the penalties are spelt out in the Bill as they were in the 1861 Act.<lb/>
My second reason for supporting the amendment is that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hornsby- Smith, pointed out, in these cases a fine is likely to have very little deterrent effect. I take the point of the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge, about our universal desire to reduce the prison population, and the doubts as to whether in certain cases prison is a deterrent. However, these amendments affect very few people. They will not increase the prison population by any substantial number, and in this particular case I do believe that imprisonment will be a deterrent.<lb/>
I refer your Lordships to the comparison mentioned in the Second Reading debate between the danger of what may happen if this Bill is passed and what used to happen (and no doubt still does in a reduced number of cases) on abortion. There can be backstreet circumcision, as there was back-street abortion. It is not normally conducted by members of the medical profession&#x2014;although we know that it has been conducted by them at a very lucrative rate. It is more likely that this operation will be performed by unskilled people who, once the Bill is passed, will certainly know that it is regarded in this country as a very important and serious offence. But they will know that only if this kind of amendment, which lays down imprisonment and/or a fine, is spelt out to them.<lb/>
We also know that, as in back-street abortion, the fees paid for this kind of operation may well be very large. In that case, the fine will not be any kind of deterrent. We as the Parliament of this country should make it quite plain, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor did, that this is considered to be a wounding offence&#x2014;an offence of wounding against the person&#x2014;and that the penalties for that are the same as those for any other kind of deliberate wounding. It is
<col>446</col>
only if we spell that out clearly that we can attack the danger of the Bill being circumvented by back-street methods, which must be clearly defined as a grave offence against the person. I believe that these amendments&#x2014;and this kind of amendment alone&#x2014;will make this clear to the public.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01617"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: I fully sympathise with the strength of feeling which has led noble Lords to support this amendment&#x2014;indeed, these two amendments. But I beg the House to think of it from the penological point of view and from the point of view of the appropriateness of custodial sentences. There are two kinds of people who are likely to commit offences under this Bill: first, those who do it for gain; and, secondly, those who do it for religious and/or cultural reasons. The majority of those who do it for gain will presumably be qualified medical practitioners, for whom it is correct to say that the threat of a fine may not be the overriding consideration. But the condemnation of their medical colleagues will be inevitable if they are convicted of an offence under this Act. They will certainly suffer far more severely from the disapproval of medical colleagues than from the fine itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01618"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: Does the noble Lord not realise that in the case of back-street abortions, many medically qualified people made a career of this, despite the fact that they were barred by the British Medical Council? As I am putting this to him, will he also consider that the likelihood is that back-street circumcisions will be performed professionally by many people who have no medical qualifications whatever?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01619"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: I was about to raise that second category in my next remarks. Of course the condemnation of the law in this case will apply particularly strongly to medical practitioners. The problem about back-street circumcisions is not really an issue of the kind of penalty that should be imposed but whether such people can be found. I believe that is the consideration to which we should be confining ourselves.<lb/>
So far as those who do it for ritual or religious reasons, again I really do question whether imprisonment is an appropriate penalty. I suggest that the question we should ask is, if imprisonment is to be imposed, are these the kind of people who will require secure custodial treatment or the kind who will go pretty well straight away into open prisons, where security is not the concern? Custodial sentences are for the protection of the rest of the nation and not for custody itself. Unless we are absolutely convinced that these people are a danger to the rest of the nation and should be locked away in secure conditions, we ought not to be creating new custodial offences.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01620"><member>Baroness Lockwood</member><membercontribution>: I rise to support the amendments. I do so on the grounds that I think the nature of this offence is something which we must take into account. I very much appreciate the arguments of my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey and others about custodial offences and not wanting to
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0231"/>
<col>447</col>
increase the prison population, but we are not today concerned with the reform of penal law. If we were, we should be looking at the whole range of penal offences. We are here to consider a Bill which seeks to outlaw a very serious offence and one which we do not want to see grow in this country. Therefore I think it is absolutely essential that this House should make it as clear as it possibly can to the rest of the country that this offence will not be tolerated. If that is so, the only remedy we have is the most serious remedy in our land&#x2014;imprisonment. On those grounds, I support these amendments. I do so without prejudice to what I might say on a future occasion if we are reviewing the whole of the penal system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01621"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Baroness sits down, may I point out that neither I, nor I think the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, gave the overcrowding of prisons&#x2014;which we all admit to be disgraceful&#x2014;as a reason for what we said. Both of us&#x2014;I speak for myself, but I think for him also&#x2014;believe that to send someone to prison, where it can do him or her no good, where it has no deterrent effect, and where the people do not understand the reason for it, is ridiculous, and we oppose it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01622"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say how very much I support the noble Baroness's amendment. It has been mentioned that female circumcision might be carried out for cultural or religious reasons; but when one comes to live in a country which is not one's own, one must first assume that one is going to obey the law of that land. Although we make very great allowances so far as religious and cultural practices are concerned, I do not think that in a case such as this that point should be taken into consideration. So far as the overcrowding of prisons is concerned, I quite agree that that must be considered; but, on the other hand, the offence will not involve very large numbers, and so I do not think that that consideration should stand in the way.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01624"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: The question is not whether all those convicted should or should not be sent to prison, but whether the courts should have available to them prison sentences to be imposed on those whom the courts consider it appropriate to deal with in that way. I was very disappointed that the Government were not able to tell us what to do. I am even more disappointed that I am not able to tell the Committee what to do. The Committee is full of wise heads, and many strong arguments have been advanced on both sides. On this occasion, when the arguments are so closely balanced, it would seem to be a time when it would be logical to have a Division. But I must say that I rather hope that there need not be a Division for a reason which I think will be obvious to all of those who have heard the debate. Although the measure is a non-party one, it is not absolutely clear that it is a non-sex one, as it were. So if those who are against the amendment are able to accept that it might be inserted in the Bill, at least at this stage, I should find that a very happy outcome.</membercontribution></p>

The primitive attitude to female circumcision rests not only on traditions, but on the male desire for the female to be pure for him. They will go to any length to achieve this, and they achieve it very well by cutting off the seat of pleasure. That is not only the most cruel, but also the most unkind, the most primitive, and the most important aspect of the matter which we should reject.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01635">The noble Lord said: Having settled what is illegal and what punishment there shall be for those who break the law, we now pass to the question of who shall be entitled to perform what would otherwise be an illegal act, if he thinks fit, and why. As drafted, the Bill states that the operation may be done for the physical health of the patient provided that,
<quote>"two registered medical practitioners, not being members of the same practice",</quote>
are of the opinion that it should be done. During the discussions which between the Second Reading and Committee Stage of the Bill have taken place in the customary way with various medical bodies and the Government, I have accepted the view which was put to me that that provision is too stringent. The view was particularly that of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. I may add in passing that it was not the view of the British Medical Association, nor was it that of the Royal College of Nursing, nor the Royal College of Midwives.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01636">It was, however, the view of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists which, after all, has a great deal to say in matters of this kind. The college stated that tens of thousands of operations which fall under the definition in Clause 1 are carried out every year for the physical health of the patient. The operations are typically for cancer and for pre-cancerous conditions. Why, the college asked, should a doctor have to obtain the opinion of another doctor, in another practice, before going ahead with what is a
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0232"/>
<col>449</col>
perfectly routine operation? I think that the college is right. That is why I commend the amendment, which will have the effect of requiring the opinion of only one doctor&#x2014;and that is putting back the provision just as though it referred to any other operation&#x2014;provided that in the opinion of the doctor or surgeon who does the operation it is done for the physical health of the patient, and not for any other reason.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01637">There is one other point which I should touch upon in passing. It was also represented to me by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists that midwives should have the same right to perform the operation if, in their opinion, it was for the physical health of the patient, because the need to perform an operation of this kind could arise during an obstetrical emergency in the course of childbirth. I have looked into this point very carefully, and of course it is obviously so that a midwife alone with an obstetrical emergency must have the right legally to do whatever she has to do for the physical health of her patient.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01638">The obstetrical procedure that we are talking about here is called episiotomy, and it consists of a cut into or down the perineum, which may be very slight, or it could be a considerable incision, which is afterwards repaired. It is a cut&#x2014;and that is the key word. If Members of your Lordships' Committee will be so kind as to turn to Clause 1(1)(<i>a</i>), you will see that the word "cut" does not appear there. The words which are used are "excise", which means to cut out, "infibulate", which means permanently to sew up in an unnatural manner, and "mutilate", which means mutilate. The work which does not appear there is "cut". So I believe that I am safe in recommending the Committee to accept the amendment without any mention of the midwife, because she will be quite all right in the ordinary practice of her duties; the Bill will not touch here. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01639"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: This clause, and the one which follows it, are the two clauses in the Bill which give the Government the greatest difficulty. I accept that the proposals contained in these amendments quite significantly improve the position so far as the Government are concerned, but we remain doubtful in particular about the requirement that the views of two psychiatrists shall be taken into account if the operation is to be done for reasons of mental health&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01640"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: I wonder whether the noble Lord would be so courteous as to allow me to intervene? I apologise to the Committee. I had completely forgotten that the two psychiatrists referred to in the sub-paragraph were dealt with in the same amendment. No, indeed, they are not. I am right, and the noble Lord is wrong. The two psychiatrists are in fact referred to in Amendment No. 5, and at the moment we are on Amendment No. 4. If the noble Lord thinks fit, I hope that we can clear the position of a surgeon and the question of physical health under Amendment No. 4, before proceeding to consider the question of mental health under Amendment No. 5.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01641"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is aware of the anxieties that we have about the particular matter which is addressed by this amendment, because we have discussed them privately together on an earlier occasion. I have to say that I am not entirely convinced by the arguments which the noble Lord adduced about the situation of midwives, which we would certainly wish to consider rather carefully. The noble Lord will remember the thoughts that I have put to him privately on that matter and I hope that he will allow me the opportunity of considering the words that he used in the Committee this afternoon in support of the assertion that he now puts to your Lordships. I was hoping to avoid undue discussion of the subsequent amendment by simply, in a very short way, expressing the Government's view on that, but I am happy to await another opportunity.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01643"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: What about sex change operations? Sex change operations are usually the other way round: they usually make women out of men and so the surgeon is cutting bits of men and not bits of women.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01649"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: I think that is the case. If we are to tackle the difficult question of so-called sex change operations in an amendment in Committee to this Bill&#x2014;which is for another purpose&#x2014;let us first be clear that there is no such thing as a sex change operation. There are artificial constructions which can be made in the person of a man and on the person of a woman which will help them to live as if they belonged to the other sex, but in law and in biology they remain of the original sex. All right, they are called "sex change" operations for short.<lb/>
I do not think that anyone would argue that such an operation should be carried out except for the health, either physical or mental, of the patient. The present
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0233"/>
<col>451</col>
amendment deals with those who have a right to declare what is and is not for the physical health of a patient. I do not believe that the so-called sex change operations come into the discussions on this amendment at all. They may come into the discussion on the next amendment, which deals with the mental health of the patient, and perhaps we could defer the discussion until we come to that amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>(<i>aa</i>) two consultants in psychiatry are of the opinion that the operation is necessary for the mental health of that person; and").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01655">The noble Lord said: We come now to the question of the mental health of the patient. When an African woman goes along and asks for a so-called circumcision in this country or anywhere outside Africa, she has to convince the doctor&#x2014;if she goes to a doctor&#x2014;that she needs it. The first reaction of any doctor in this country is, "No, I will not do that; it is abhorrent". But if she then appears very miserable until she gets it, in the conviction that she ought to have it because her custom demands it, then the doctor concerned may conclude that she is depressed and that the only way in which to remove her depression is to accede to her wishes and perform the operation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01656">It should be the purpose of the Committee to prevent that. It is too easy a way round what we wish to suppress. That, then, is one of the reasons why I have proposed the rather laborious procedure of requiring two consultants in psychiatry to give their opinion that the operation would indeed be for the mental health of the patient.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01657">There are other cases. It has been presented to me and to the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, that there are some women and girls who get such a terrible itch in that part of their person that their life is rendered quite impossible by it, but there is nothing physically wrong with them, and that a surgeon may then say, "Well, I cannot cure the itch but I can remove the part which itches" and that in those cases he ought to be free to do so. There are also the cases which are reported&#x2014;once again by those who speak for the Royal College&#x2014;of girls and women who believe that they are not pleasantly formed in those parts and wish to have nature's work corrected. They may become so miserable about it that the surgeon may decide that the best way to relieve them of their misery&#x2014;not of any illness because there is no physical defect&#x2014;is to change the shape of their body.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01658">It seemed to me that in that case the person who ought to be deciding about how ill the woman is mentally, how deeply depressed and how deluded she may be about her own shape, is not a surgeon at all but perhaps a consultant, or two consultants, in psychiatry
<col>452</col>
and that is why I have put them into the Bill. Why two?&#x2014;for the familiar reasons; familiar from the old abortion legislation&#x2014;that one may make a trade of it, two are less likely to do so and, therefore, it is a greater safeguard. It is as simple as that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01659">I am not at all sure that I should tell the Committee that I have got it right. I am not at all sure that there have to be two psychiatrists and I am open to conviction that there need not be. For that reason I am disappointed again that the Government have not seen fit to put down an amendment which they could have agreed with the Royal College&#x2014;since it is, I believe, the opinion of the Royal College which sways the Government on these matters&#x2014;for our consideration at this stage. I have put an amendment down because I still think that this is probably the best way to proceed. I do not think that there will be many cases in a year of the kind that I have outlined. I do not think that the burden on consultant psychiatrists will be very great. There can be no question of an emergency. Nobody ever goes into a deep depression or suffers from delusion in an emergency. There is always time for a second or third opinion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01660">I submit to the Committee that probably the amendment has it about right. In the Bill as originally drafted there was nothing about mental health at all. The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, spoke about draconian policing arrangements. I admit that the Bill as drafted was draconian: it said physical health or nothing. Now it has changed to physical health on the decision of any one doctor, and mental health if two psychiatrists say so. In my view it is about right, and I would hate to go beyond that. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01661"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: Of course this is a non-party Bill and I must make clear that I am speaking only for myself. I would be appalled if this amendment were accepted. I very much hope that it will be withdrawn for further consideration. It seems to me that the noble Lord is scoring in his own goal because he is writing into the Bill other circumstances in which female circumcision is to be allowable. He is broadening the reasons for this mutilation to take place. It seems to me that, by accepting the fact that there are physical conditions&#x2014;for instance, some forms of cancer&#x2014;where it is necessary for an operation to be performed in this way, we really are opening the doors wide to abuse by suggesting that a couple of psychiatrists can find that it would improve the mental health of a woman to be mutilated.<lb/>
There are all sorts of mental illness which have masochistic impulses in which people want to be hurt. It seems to me to be extraordinary to suggest that any woman who is so mentally ill that she wants to be hurt in this terrible way should have her wishes carried out as a result of professional advice. As for the noble Lord suggesting that there might be cases of malformation, in my view that comes under the physical problem. If it is a question of itching, that is a physical problem. These women must be helped, and they must be helped by the profession to resolve these symptoms, because in the cases to which the noble Lord has referred the problems are largely those of symptoms.<lb/>
In fact, if I were to come across two psychiatrists who would certify that for the mental health of a woman she should be mutilated in this horrible way, I
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0234"/>
<col>453</col>
would suggest that they be sent to a couple of psychiatrists&#x2014;in fact to the whole College of Psychiatrists&#x2014;because the situation would seem to me to be quite unacceptable. The noble Lord said that he included two psychiatrists because he thought that one might be on a profiteering game, and that two would be less likely to be so. I can assure the noble Lord that, having lived through some of the bad old abortion days, if there were two doctors involved, there were likely to be twice as many abortions, and there is certainly no protection in asking for two opinions because one chap always asks another chap who he knows would be on the same side; there would not be any contradictory evidence.<lb/>
Therefore, I hope that this amendment will not be pressed. I think that we must all consider this further, and try to work out if there are any ways of helping women who are in real distress; and I hope that that help will be constructive and not mutilating.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01662"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a few words about this. I think that we have been discussing certain aspects of female circumcision in an almost ridiculous way. When we speak of pruritus as a reason for circumcision, I do not think that there is any sense in what we are saying; it is ridiculous. There are any number of conditions where it exists and it does not need female circumcision. It is dangerous for us to speak as though we are doctors and specialists; we ought not to do it on this Bill. Because it is a good and a necessary Bill, we ought to pass the Bill without delving into all kinds of mental conditions. What mental conditions? We do not need to consider that matter. We should stick to the Bill and its limitations. If we go further, we shall make fools of ourselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01663"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps I could say to the noble Baronesses, Lady Jeger and Lady Gaitskell, that one of the difficulties is that the term "female circumcision" has come to describe a whole range of operations, from a quite severe total removal of the clitoris, as it is called, to something very much less than that. It is the difficulties with operations at the smaller end of the scale that we are here considering.<lb/>
As the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, explained, the fact of the matter is that the best expert advice that we can obtain is to the effect that there really are difficulties here and there are certain circumstances&#x2014;such as those described by the noble Lord&#x2014;where, in the Government's view, a formalised requirement for a consultant psychiatrist to be involved is not necessarily appropriate. That, frankly, is the principal difficulty which the Government now see with the measures which the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, brings before the Committee at this moment. Therefore, I hope that he will not wish to proceed to get this Bill through its final stages because, as I say, the Government have considerable doubts about a good deal of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01664"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: I should like to ask the noble Lord the Minister whether he could ask his advisers how often an operation has been performed in this area for a psychiatric reason, because it is known that phantom pain can drive people to insanity, alcoholism or suicide. If it is a case of saving life, then perhaps such an operation should be performed.</membercontribution></p>
<col>454</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01665"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: With respect, the present legal position provides that these operations may take place, and I think that the onus for proving that some new constraint is necessary rests upon the noble Lord, Lord Kennet,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01666"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: Let me attempt to do so. Let us suppose that I walk into a surgery and say, "My right arm hurts, I ask you to remove it"; the doctor says, "This is bad news", and he causes me to be subjected to every known physical test, and finds that there is nothing wrong with my right arm. He may then say, "You have a delusion", and I say, "It is not a delusion, it is pain". He may then say, "It is phantom pain. It would indeed remove the pain if I removed your arm". Would we not think that the surgeon who forthwith proceeded to do so would be very wrong if he had not consulted a psychiatrist before doing so? Of course, any sane, qualified surgeon would consult a psychiatrist in such a case. Of course he would.<lb/>
In what way is my arm more valuable than the sexual parts of a woman which it is proposed should be free to be removed on the say-so of a surgeon alone when there is nothing whatever wrong with them? I am happy to withdraw this amendment and to leave the Bill in the condition in which it started; namely, that the operation shall be legal only for the physical health of the patient, and there is no let-out at all from that. If that is the will of the Committee&#x2014;and I rather sense that it is the will of the Committee&#x2014;then I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01667"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: Before the noble Lord withdraws his amendment, may I suggest to him that, in the intervening time between the Committee stage and the Report stage, or when the Bill is reintroduced, he considers this aspect of introducing an amendment which is based upon consultation with two psychiatrists for the mental health of the person. I think that we are in a difficulty here. I should like the noble Lord either to answer this this afternoon, or to consider it. None of us in this Committee is fit to understand the deep, psychological trauma that this traditional practice produces in its victims. None of us is capable of understanding the consequences of centuries of practice which have developed this custom. Therefore, none of us is capable of understanding what deep mental disturbance may be caused&#x2014;indeed, is often caused&#x2014;among young women who do not have this operation performed.<lb/>
I should like the noble Lord to consider whether, by including the consultation with two psychiatrists, he may not be opening the way to the possibility that in certain cases two psychiatrists will find that young girls&#x2014;who have not been circumcised but who come from a culture in which circumcision is considered to be an essential element in growing up, in becoming an adult and in being accepted as a member of the tribe or clan&#x2014;can have such a deep mental depression if they are prohibited from circumcision that they will have to say, "In this case, for the mental health of the patient, it is necessary to circumcise". I should like the noble Lord to consider that possibility, because in my view the answer to it is not that we simply vilify the culture, or the tradition, but that the psychiatrists' job is to find the way to restore such patients to mental health without going through the process of circumcision.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01668"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord asked me whether I agreed with him. The answer is, yes, I do. I entirely agree with him, and I notice also the Government's unhappiness about having those two psychiatrists on the scene; and that is why I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01669">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01670">Clause 2, as amended, agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01671">Clause 3 [<i>Notification of operations under section 2, etc.</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01672"><member>Lord Kennet</member> had given notice of his intention to move Amendment No. 6:
<quote>Page 2, line 14, leave out from ("be") to end of line 18 and insert ("separately recorded by the consultants concerned in a form which may be inspected by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Security").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01673">The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 6 is about what the consultants in psychiatry have to do in order to make their opinion accessible to the chief medical officer of the department. Since the consultants have not been written into the Bill, this amendment does not arise, and therefore I do not move it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01674">[<i>Amendment No. 6 not moved.</i>]</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01675">5.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01676"><member>Lord Kennet</member> moved Amendment No. 7:
<quote>Page 2, line 19, leave out paragraph (<i>b</i>).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01677">The noble Lord said: We are back now with physical health. We are back with what the registered medical practitioner does when he considers the operation is necessary for physical health. Clause 3(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill as drafted is part of what the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, has called my "draconian policing arrangements". I think that in this case his description is justified. It is a hit draconian and I propose therefore to delete the paragraph.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01678">This would mean simply that the surgeon would have the same right to do this operation to safeguard the physical health of the patient as he would to do any other operation, but the operation could only legally be done in a National Health hospital or in a registered nursing home, and in both places operation notes are automatically preserved. I consider that that is enough safeguard for the future, and therefore the extra arrangements in the clause of the Bill are not necessary. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01679"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>; I am bound to admit that I find this amendment something of an improvement. As I have said in relation to earlier amendments, I do not think that it goes far enough, but as far as it goes I agree with it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01680"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: May I ask the noble Lord what he would think far enough? This simply allows the surgeon to do this operation like any other operation so long as it is in a sterile place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01681"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: I was speaking in general terms about the other improvements I should have liked to have seen in the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

I had thought that, if the Bill went through the Committee stage without too much trouble&#x2014;and I think it has gone through the Committee stage without too much trouble and has been improved&#x2014;it would be right to bring it before the House on Report and remaining stages either tomorrow or the next day.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01691"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01692">What progress has been made in establishing bail verification schemes at magistrates' courts and whether they propose to extend the number of such schemes in view of the urgent need to reduce the remand population in prisons.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01693"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member>: In 1975 a Home Office circular commended to magistrates' courts a bail information scheme introduced experimentally at Camberwell Green magistrates' court. Between 1975 and 1980, 37 schemes were known to have been established. By 1980 some courts had already abandoned their schemes following the introduction of the Bail Act 1976, and others did so with the establishment of duty solicitor schemes. We have no information about the number of bail information schemes which are at present in existence. Their establishment or continuation is a matter for individual magistrates' courts to decide in the light of local needs.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01705"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member>: The Education Act 1981, which became fully operative on 1st April 1983, placed a clear obligation on local education authorities and school governors to identify and provide for the special educational needs of the children for whom they are responsible. A joint circular issued on 31st January 1983 by the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Social Security stated that every school was likely to have some pupils with special educational needs and that local education authorities should provide guidance to their schools on the arrangements for identifying, assessing and meeting such needs. While recognising the key role of the teacher, the circular emphasised the need to involve other professionals, including educational psychologists, as appropriate.

<title>Lebanon UN Force: British Contingent</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01711"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01712">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01713">To ask Her Majesty's Government what is the role of British troops in Lebanon and what is their current strength.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01714"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the role of the multinational force in Lebanon is to help the Lebanese Government and armed forces in the Beirut area. The present strength of the British contingent is 99 men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01715"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend please tell me who, in fact, has overall command of this force in the Lebanon, which is made up of the armed forces of a number of different countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01716"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is, of course, a United Nations force, and the United Nations commander is in control of the various contingents, which include United States forces, Italian forces and French forces.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01717"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I also ask whether there is any particular emphasis on the question of training and whether, in fact, these 99 men are composed of a number of different training teams? If so, is there any special role for them in that line?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01718"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the role of our contingent is to patrol undesignated routes and to report any trouble it finds to the Lebanese armed forces, who will of course deal with it as appropriate, it being in the Lebanon. As regards training, I am afraid that I have no information for my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01719"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord make clear under what resolution of the United Nations these troops are operating? Is he quite sure that the facts he has given us are correct?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01720"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that I do not have the Security Council resolution number in front of me, but as far as I am aware the facts that I have just given are correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01721"><member>The Earl of Selkirk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether there is an overall commander, and, if so, what nationality he is?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01722"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I presume that there is an overall commander, but I do not know of what nationality he is.</membercontribution></p>
<col>460</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01723"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while accepting the need for the presence of our troops in the Lebanon at this time, could the noble Lord say for how long they are likely to be there? Is not a specific period set down? Are there any special conditions attached to their presence there; and, if there is a specific period, do Her Majesty's Government contemplate that it will be necessary to extend that period?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01724"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this contingent has been in Beirut since 8th February. The original request was for it to be deployed in the Lebanon for three months. In response to a recent request we agreed to extend this deployment by up to a further three months; that is, up to 7th August. We have no plans to extend the deployment beyond that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01725"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord spoke of a request. From whom did the request come for this United Nations force to which we contribute?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01726"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from the Lebanon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01727"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a matter of great importance that we have contributed to this United Nations force? Should we not derive (as I am sure the people of the Lebanon do) some gratification from that fact?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01728"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is a great credit to this country and to our armed forces that we have been asked to participate in such a force. Of course, we were delighted to do so, in the same way as we were delighted to accede to the recent request from the Lebanese Government to extend this deployment for a further three months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01729"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as these British troops will be serving under a non-British command, can we have an assurance that there will be a British company sergeant-major looking after their welfare?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01730"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I did not say that the British troops are serving under a non-British command. I said that I thought it likely that there is an overall commander for the multinational force, which is rather different. But I can confirm that the 99 men are from the Queen's Dragoon Guards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01731"><member>Lord Molson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister not know the name and nationality of the overall commander?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01732"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. I shall have to write to my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01733"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, frankly, is the noble Lord not confusing the United Nations force in the Lebanon with the recent quadripartite American. French, Italian and British force? Could that not be the explanation of the apparent confusion?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01734"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no, I do not think that I am confused; but if I am, naturally I shall apologise to the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01736"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01737">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01738">To ask Her Majesty's Government what progress they have made in securing the release of the British mercenaries who have now been imprisoned in Angola for over six years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01739"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we continue to press the Angolan Government at the highest level on the early release of the prisoners, and we shall maintain our efforts as a matter of high priority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01740"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the long time that has elapsed, and particularly in view of the success of the Americans in securing the release of their nationals from Angola, can the Minister tell me whether our representative there knew of the American efforts, whether he co-operated with them, and whether we are willing to do a deal? The Minister spoke of high level efforts but, with respect, they do not appear to have been very successful. I should like to know whether we are making real efforts, and efforts which may incur doing a deal of some sort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01741"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I cannot say whether a deal is in prospect. If it is, of course, this would be confidential information. So far as our pressure goes, our Ambassador last made representations direct to the President when he had his last private audience on 9th February. But his normal channel of communication with the Angolan Government is through the Minister of External Relations, to whom he has frequently put the case for the prisoners' early release. The two most recent dates were 4th May and 7th May.<lb/>
As regards the American deal to which the noble Lord referred, I do not know whether there was any British input into that, but most certainly the Ambassador would have known that it was happening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01742"><member>Lord Gridley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has my noble friend any information about the conditions under which these soldiers are imprisoned? Has any attempt been made by the International Red Cross to obtain information on this score?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01743"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is inevitable that conditions in an Angolan prison are hard, but I can tell my noble friend that embassy staff visit the prisoners monthly. When they were last visited on 14th April, the men were reported to be in reasonable health. So far as the International Red Cross is concerned, I regret that I have no information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01744"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord for the information he has given about the representations which Her Majesty's Government have made in this matter. Would he confirm that this matter was raised by his right honourable friend when the Angolan Foreign
<col>462</col>
Secretary visited this country a few weeks ago? Would he not agree that the continued detention of these British mercenaries, whose presence there initially we certainly did not condone, can do nothing but damage any prospect of good relations between this country and Angola?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01745"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, whatever our nationals have done abroad, this Government believe in making the greatest efforts not to endanger bilateral relations, between two particular countries, and I can certainly confirm that to the noble Lord. So far as his original question is concerned, yes, I can confirm that my right honourable friend, when he met his opposite number in London recently, raised the subject of these prisoners.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Cruise Missiles: Dual Control</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01746">2.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01747"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01748">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01749">To ask Her Majesty's Government why, if present arrangements for "joint decision" mean that there will be an effective potential British veto on the use, in war, of United States cruise missiles stationed in this country, the United States Government will only agree to confirm this fact by the installation of a dual key system of control if the United Kingdom agrees to purchase these weapons at prohibitive expense.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01750"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as has been made clear on many occasions, the arrangements for joint decision are perfectly satisfactory and do not require supplementing or confirmation by some other means. Furthermore all dual key control systems have been based on the ownership and operation of the weapons systems involved, apart from the warhead. Such ownership carries with it the appropriate costs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01751"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not nevertheless a fact that, in the absence, so far as the cruise missile is concerned, of any dual operational control, the Americans can always in the last resort&#x2014;I repeat, in the last resort&#x2014;retain the possibilty of discharging these missiles without formal British consent, and that this is in practice a possibility which they are reluctant to abandon? Secondly, may I ask the noble Lord whether the denial of his noble colleague Lord Belstead on 3rd May last that cruise missiles were first strike weapons because,
<quote>"the NATO alliance &#x2026; will never, strike first at another enemy" [<i>Official Report.</i> 3/5/83; col. 66.]</quote>
means that there is no prospect of the Americans ever making first use of nuclear missiles, or bombs for that matter, deployed on British territory?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01752"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend Lord Belstead has said on many occasions, the use of weapon systems operating from United States bases in the United Kingdom is governed by the understanding on joint decision-making between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0239"/>
<col>463</col>
summarised in the joint communiqu&#x00E9; issued in January 1952, and this has been ratified every time there has been a change of President and a change of Prime Minister.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01753"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that since 1952 the destructive power of these weapons has enormously increased and the time-scale within which decisions will have to be taken has considerably reduced? In the circumstances of the future&#x2014;involving a two-minute or three-minute flight time, probably&#x2014;is the noble Lord really satisfied that there can be the sort of political discussion and decision-making envisaged in 1952?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01754"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the situation remains as has been described. The agreement still exists. The agreement is satisfactory; and the noble Lord is incorrect when he talks about such a short flight time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01755"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord tell the House why it was that in 1958 Mr. Macmillan thought the national interest required him to buy the Thor missiles in order to attain a dual key? Last week, in debate, the noble Lord, Lord Belstead, said he did not know. Have the Government now found out and reflected on it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01756"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is in fact another question. However, as I understand it, the situation then was that we had to buy the missiles but we did not buy the warheads. The warheads may not be sold to us under both United States national law and international law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01757"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that many of us who are not unilateralists believe that the Government's position on this is becoming quite untenable, as his right honourable friend the Member for Down, South, made clear in another place this week? If the missiles are American owned and the bases from which they are going to be launched are British owned, surely that constitutes joint ownership and is therefore the basis for dual key arrangements? Missiles are no good without the bases. The bases are British, the missiles American. Is that not joint ownership?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01758"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the use of the missiles, either from actually on the bases or deployed, is a matter for joint decision under the arrangements which have been described to your Lordships on many occasions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01759"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with regard to the arrangements being untenable, is it not a fact that since 1952 every new Prime Minister, whatever party they have represented, has looked at it and has agreed the arrangement which stands today?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01760"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords. I have said that before, and I am grateful to my noble friend for saying it again.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01761"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that no nuclear missile can be fired from French soil without a French finger on the trigger? Is he
<col>464</col>
further aware that no missile can be fired from Australian, Spanish or Swiss soil because there is none? If the Government will not put us in the second category, is it not high time they at least put is in the first?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01762"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this country has in many respects relied for many years on United States assistance and presence, both conventionally within Europe and with its nuclear forces. The question of what the French do and what might happen in Australia is something for which I cannot answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01763"><member>Lord Pagent of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when the noble Lord looks at this problem, does it occur to him that the Russians think that these weapons are aimed at them by the Americans? When the Americans produce these absurd terms for granting a dual key, the Russians think the weapons are aimed by the Americans, who want an independent power to strike first. To produce a 20-year-old agreement&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01764"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord is not asking a question, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01765"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: &#x2014;dating back to before the Russians had a weapon to use is so dishonest that it raises every suspicion and puts us in great danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01766"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01767"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, peace has been maintained through deterrence for over 30 years, and the facts speak for themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01768"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister recall that in the recent exchange it was said that the 1952 agreement referred to the Thor missile? This is rather different, so does the 1952 agreement still apply in the case of missiles which are not owned by us? Will the Minister tell us briefly where the Government stand in our relationship with the United States? At the Geneva talks we are not present but the United States is. In the case of our having cruise missiles on our soil, the fact that there is no dual key means that operational control is in the hands of the Americans. Are we satellites of the Americans or are we allies, especially in the use of weapons based on our own soil?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01769"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am slightly troubled about how many different ways there are of describing the arrangements which have been in existence since 1952. In the case of cruise missiles, cruise is a different form of the weapons that have been in existence here for many years. For example, the F-111s are under exactly the same arrangements, and they are subject, in use, to joint decision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01770"><member>The Lord Bishop of Peterborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, to the Minister's mind, would it not be a sensible thing, in order to diminish the number of unverified assumptions which will be bandied about in the next three weeks to bamboozle the voting public, for the Government to issue 25 or 30 words of plain straight English explaining exactly how the veto or the control of these missiles will work if it ever unfortunately has to be operated?</membercontribution></p>

<col>465</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01771"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have made clear on many, many occasions in your Lordships' House and elsewhere exactly how the 1952 agreement applies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01772"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend agree that our peace and security depend on the NATO Alliance working in harmony, and that five countries are to provide sites for missiles of two kinds? Does he further agree that the worry about cruise missiles in the United Kingdom is more a theoretical than a practical one, hearing in mind that these missiles are in our country on bases guarded by our troops? They would have to be moved to sites for operation, escorted by our forces. Apart from the very thorough joint decision arrangement, will he agree that there is no possibility that these missiles could be used from our country against the will of our Prime Minister?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01773"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; and I am grateful to my noble friend. We welcome the presence of United States forces in this country as a visible symbol of their commitment to NATO's collective defence. It is inconceivable that a United States President would act against the wishes of the British Government in the use of these bases. Any reasonable approach to the defence of this country rests on the mutual trust and goodwill that exist between the members of the alliance; and the Government have no doubt whatever that the United States is fully committed to the collective defence of the West.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01774"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, are the Government not mistaken in saying that every Prime Minister since 1952 has been satisfied that the 1952 agreement on joint control is sufficient, in view of the fact that Mr. Macmillan, when Prime Minister, spent many millions of pounds on buying Thor missiles in order to have a physical dual key as well as the 1952 agreement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01775"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are not mistaken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01776"><member>Lord Glenamara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the noble Lord's reply to the right reverend Prelate, will he say, yes or no: have we a veto or have we not?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Nuclear Weapons: Underground Tests</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01779">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01780"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01781">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01782">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will reconsider their policy of testing nuclear
<col>466</col>
weapons underground in view of the evidence of their effect on health and lives through radiation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01783"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, Her Majesty's Government have no scientific evidence that the nuclear tests carried out underground at the Nevada test site present any health hazard to test personnel or to the population at large. We carry out only the minimum number of tests necessary to maintain the deterrent effectiveness of our nuclear forces.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01784"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord be a little surprised if I said that his Answer astonished me? Is he aware that there is authoritative evidence in America that, as a result of tests at Nevada, workers a few miles away have been contaminated, that several of them have died within months and that over a insignificant area the incidence of leukaemia in children has increased by 40 per cent.? Does he not know that in 1979 a Committee of the House of Representatives agreed that 43 radiation leaks had occurred from these tests and that 28 of them had been as severe as above ground tests?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01785"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is not quite correct. There have been claims in the technical press of a higher incidence of cancers in particular areas of the United States attributed to testing at the Nevada test site. On detailed examination, however, these claims have not been found to be scientifically well-based.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01786"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do not the Russians test their nuclear weapons to see if they work? So long as there is no danger to human life, is it not the most sensible thing to do to test them underground?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01787"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01788"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the good record of this country under successive Governments in banning tests, will the Government consider taking steps to commence effective negotiations for a comprehensive ban on tests?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01789"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a comprehensive test ban remains a United Kingdom objective. We will continue to seek an effective and verifiable treaty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01790"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, have any underground tests been undertaken in the United Kingdom? If so, is there any evidence that they have been detrimental to the health of anybody?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01791"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, no nuclear tests have taken place in the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01792"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not the reason for this that there is no area in this country big enough to conduct such tests? Is it not also the case that the Government are examining claims by British servicemen who have suffered damage, injury and death as a result of some of the tests which have taken place? In view of what my noble friend has said, is there not a <i>prima facie</i> case to look at the whole question?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0241"/>
<col>467</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01793"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first part of the noble Lord's supplementary question is that there is no place large enough in this country. So far as the other part is concerned, that dealt with nuclear tests which took place in the atmosphere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01794"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, have the Government considered the recent report of the BMA on the effects of nuclear energy, and will the Government make known their views on these horrific consequences at the same time as they make known the information for which the right reverend Prelate asked a few moments ago?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01795"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that is a different question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01796"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the recent Answer to a Parliamentary Question in the House of Commons which showed that this country was the only country to have carried out announced nuclear weapons tests in the world in the last two or three years, can the Government fill in the gaps by saying something about unannounced nuclear weapons tests which have been carried out by other countries in the last two or three years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01797"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot say anything about unannounced nuclear tests carried out by other countries but I can say that the United Kingdom has carried out 15 nuclear tests in Nevada between 1962 and 1983.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01798"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may, I will send to the Minister evidence which I have. May I ask him whether it is not the purpose of the tests to provide warheads for Trident at a cost of &#x00A3;5 million for each explosion? In view of the fact that installation of Trident is now a very controversial issue in this country, would it not be better to delay such expenditure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01799"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no information at all on costs but, as I have said, the purpose of these tests is to maintain the effectiveness of our nuclear capabilities.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01810"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 39, line 41, leave out from ("exceeding") to end of subsection (1) and insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("level 5 on the standard scale (as defined in section 75 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982); and for the purposes of this subsection&#x2014;

<li>(<i>b</i>) an order under section 143 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 which alters the sums specified in subsection (2) of the said section 37.</li>
</ol>
shall extend to Northern Ireland and the said section 75 shall have eflect as if after the words "England and Wales" there were inserted the words "or Northern Ireland".").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01811">The noble and learned Lord said: May I give a short explanation of this amendment which is here to give effect to the wishes of the joint committee although, at first sight, one would not gather that. The penalty for the offence involved in the section&#x2014;that is to say, the maximum penalty for the offence of pretending to be registered as a doctor&#x2014;was the same throughout the United Kingdom at the time of the passing of the Medical Act 1956. It was then &#x00A3;500. The penalty was altered by general provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 from &#x00A3;500 to level 5 on the standard scale which made it &#x00A3;1,000. But because that Act extends only to England, Wales and Scotland but not to Northern Ireland, the penalty for the offence in Northern Ireland was not thereby raised.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01812">The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission recommended in their report on the consolidation of the Medical Acts (Command 8839) that this discrepancy in penalties should be removed and that the same maximum penalty of level 5 on the standard scale should apply throughout the United Kingdom&#x2014;that is, also to Northern Ireland. That is contained in paragraph 4 of their report. When this matter came before the joint committee, they felt (no doubt, rightly) that the appropriate penalty for an offence was not a question to be decided by the committee but one which ought to be dealt with on the Floor of the House. Hence, the Bill was amended by the joint committee to ensure that the position under the current law which is to be altered in this minute particular should be discussed here. The amendment I am proposing restores the effect of the Law Commission recommendation. I beg to move.</p>

<title>Hovercraft (Application of Enactments)<lb/> (Amendment) Order 1983</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01837">3.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01838"><member>Lord Lyell</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 21st April be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01839">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope it will be for the convenience of your Lordships if I speak to the two orders, standing in my name on the Order Paper, together. I beg to move the draft Hovercraft (Application of Enactments) (Amendment) Order 1983, and I shall speak at the same time to the Draft Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations 1983.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01840">I have to inform your Lordships that both of these instruments have been examined by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, and I understand that they are satisfied as to the legal basis for the instruments. If I may detain your Lordships but briefly in explanation on these two orders, the substantive matters before your Lordships' House are the 1983 Regulations. These update the collision regulations which are agreed internationally through the International Maritime Organisation which is an agency of the United Nations and recognised the world over as the competent international authority on maritime matters.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01841">The detailed rules are set out in the draft regulations at Schedule 1. These are the Merchant Shipping Regulations. Your Lordships will see that they cover such important requirements as the steering and sailing rules and the provision of sound and light signals. The first set of rules were agreed by the International Maritime Organisation as long ago as 1960, and the present rules were agreed by the IMO in 1972. They have been applied internationally since 1977. The rules are now observed by more than 80 maritime nations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01842">After very careful consideration, the IMO has agreed that some changes are necessary to the rules drafted in 1972. At the same time, the IMO did not wish to make extensive changes which might well cause confusions and uncertainties within the shipping world. Therefore, only a limited number of amendments have been adopted and these are listed for your Lordships' reference in the explanatory note to the regulations. Your Lordships will find that on page 31. They deal with such matters as exemptions for certain types of vessels from the effects of Rule 10(<i>d</i>). I should explain to your Lordships that Rule 10 on page 8 of the 1977 order which we are considering in conjunction with the draft order before us today is concerned with the special provisions for ships passing through traffic separation schemes&#x2014;the Dover Strait is but one example. Rule 10(<i>d</i>) deals with those ships that can use inshore traffic zones. There are also important amendments to the provisions for lights and sound signals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01843">The International Maritime Organisation has agreed that these amendments should come into force
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0243"/>
<col>471</col>
on 1st June 1983. Therefore, the approval of your Lordships' House is being sought to this country fulfilling its obligations to the IMO to ensure that United Kingdom ships wherever they may be, and other vessels in our territorial waters, comply with the new rules.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01844">At the same time we are taking the opportunity to make the regulations under Section 21 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1979 which gives my right honourable friend the Secretary of State powers by regulations to deal with safety matters on ships. I hope your Lordships will agree that it is sensible that the collision regulations are dealt with in this way. The draft regulations therefore revoke the earlier collision regulations and the Distress Signals Order of 1977 as it applies to ships. This was made under powers contained principally in the Merchant Shipping Act 1894. One of the consequences 'of making these important amendments which apply to ships is the need to ensure that they are applied also to hovercraft. It is for this reason that the first Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper is before your Lordships this afternoon.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01845">The 1968 Hovercraft Act provides that hovercraft should be treated as vehicles in their own right rather than ships or aircraft. The 1968 Act, however, recognises the important need to ensure that relevant safety rules are observed by hovercraft operating in a marine environment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01846">The Hovercraft (Application of Enactments) Order 1972, which was made under the 1968 Act, applies to hovercraft a number of enactments relating also to ships. These include, to take as examples, provisions relating to the carriage of dangerous goods, to distress signals and also to the prevention of collisions. The purpose of the amendment order is to bring the existing provisions in line with the changes to be introduced in the new 1983 collision regulations relating to ships.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01847">With that brief explanation of the two orders before us today, I hope your Lordships will agree that the changes proposed in these two instruments are sensible and also that they have particular regard for the general safety within the marine environment. These have been carefully considered by the International Maritime Organisation and we are content with the conclusions of the IMO. For that reason, I commend them to this House, and beg to move the first order, dealing with hovercraft, that stands in my name.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01848">Moved. That the draft order laid before the House on 21st April be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01849"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I thank the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for explaining so succinctly the purposes of these two orders, and for dealing with them together, which I am sure is for the convenience of the House today. I am glad to know that the Joint Committee have approved both these orders. I wonder whether the noble Lord could say, with regard to the existing orders, how many prosecutions have been made for contravention of the existing rules, and what has been the level of success of those prosecutions? At the same time, can the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, say whether prosecutions have been taken against foreign flag vessels, and whether or not
<col>472</col>
such prosecutions have been proceeded with in United Kingdom courts?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01850"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are very grateful for the close attention and the detailed scrutiny paid to these orders by the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede. We are also grateful to him for the reception he has given to these orders. I hope I did not detain your Lordships for too long. As the noble Lord noted, they are a trifle complicated, but very important. The noble Lord put to me a triple-headed question, and I will attempt to answer the three parts of his question. He asked me about contraventions of the rules. Since 1977, the Department of Trade has taken some 50 cases in respect of infringements which were made by United Kingdon flag vessels. Most of these have been in respect of offences in connection with the traffic separation schemes and, of course, when the department has definite evidence that a foreign flag vessel has contravened these rules, the facts are reported to that particular flag state. Again, we are advised that since 1977, which we are conveniently taking as a base here, proceedings have been taken in approximately 450 reported offences.<lb/>
Referring to the arrangements for taking action against foreign flag vessels, all the relevant facts are reported to the foreign Administration, who are then required to consider what action should be taken under their own national legislation. We consider that this procedure has worked well over the years and the IMO takes a special interest in ensuring proper consideration by all flag states of any offences which are reported in this way.<lb/>
Referring to the third supplementary question by the noble Lord&#x2014;the taking of proceedings against foreign flag vessels in the United Kingdom&#x2014;as the noble Lord will have noticed, the regulations give specific statutory authority to take such action for contraventions in territorial waters of the United Kingdom. We reserve the right to do so, but the assumption is made that the ship is coming to, and will berth in, a United Kingdom port, and that the master can be located swiftly and a summons served. As your Lordships will understand, there can be practical difficulties as regards enforcing the law in this particular way.<lb/>
I hope I have been able to give some satisfaction to the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, in replying to his questions. We are very grateful for his detailed scrutiny and for the reception this order has received from your Lordships this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Solvent Abuse (Scotland) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01856">3.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01857"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. It is a very short Bill&#x2014;it is a Bill of three clauses, two of which are fairly formal&#x2014;but its importance is not to be judged by its size. There has been growing concern in Scotland (and, indeed in England, if the facts be known) about the behaviour of children concerning solvent abuse. It causes harm to the children, distress to the parents and, indeed, from the point of view of passers by or even neighbours, a sense of danger.<lb/>
The fact that we have a Bill today is a recognition of the work done over ten years by a man who died a year ago, the late James Dempsey, Member of Parliament for Coatbridge and Airdrie. I think he first raised this subject in the House of Commons in 1968, arising out of a tragedy that happened in his own area. Since that time more and more people have shared his concern, and I know that in 1981 the Scottish Office was moved to make inquiries into what could be done, and into the incidence of the practice. Just last year it commissioned a special report from two people in Edinburgh University about the whole subject. We have not had that report yet, but the Secretary of State was sufficiently concerned to announce on 16th January last year that from a preliminary report he felt he should introduce legislation along the lines of this Bill.<lb/>
It was Mr. David Marshall, member of Parliament for Shettlestone, Glasgow, who anticipated that in a Ten-Minute Rule Bill which was accepted by the House, received its Second Reading and had a full Committee stage and a full Report stage and Third Reading. Now, with the support of all parties in the House, this Bill arrives on our doorstep today. May I say that I am grateful to Mr. Marshall for his initiative. I am also grateful to the Scottish Office and to the Secretary of State for lending their unqualified support. I am particularly grateful to the Lord Advocate and the Crown Office for the fact that it has been very well drafted indeed.<lb/>
I am not going to explain the facts; I think everyone knows the problem. What has worried people is what could be done about it. We do not want to create for children a new offence, and the Bill does not do that; but it is obvious that the children need care and guidance&#x2014;some kind of care and attention&#x2014;and the parents, too. When it comes down to it, eventually there is a parental responsibility which parents must accept and share with others in curing this difficult condition for their children.<lb/>
I have to apologise that it is purely a Scottish Bill, although it is also an English problem. The reason is that in Scotland in 1968&#x2014;and I am not going to tell your Lordships who was Secretary of State at that time&#x2014;we dispensed with the juvenile courts and instituted a system of children's hearings at which, on the decision of a reporter (who generally tends to be a person with legal qualifications), children in need of care are brought before a panel of lay people; and in Scotland these lay people are drawn from all sections of the community. The parents are there; the child is there; the police are not there. There is no paraphernalia of a court about it. It is very informal,
<col>474</col>
and I am glad to say that over ten years the panels have built up a very good reputation for dealing sympathetically and firmly with cases like this.<lb/>
Section 32 of the Act says:
<quote>"A child may be in need of compulsory measures of care &#x2026; if any of the conditions mentioned in the next following subsection is satisfied with respect to him &#x2026;
<ol>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) he is beyond the control of his parent; or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) through lack of parental care he &#x2026; is exposed to moral danger; or</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) the lack of care".</li>
</ol></quote>
The child is at risk. Other conditions cover truancy from school or committing an offence. "Care" is defined, as it will be for this Bill, too, as including protection, control, guidance and treatment. In that informal atmosphere the child is central to the hearing, but the parents are there. The panel comes to a decision on what should be done.<lb/>
Unfortunately, that list of grounds for a reference to the reporter and, through the reporter, to the children's panel does not include anything that would deal with solvent abuse. I think the draftsmen are to be congratulated on how they have done it. They have added another ground for bringing a child before the reporter and the panel, which is that the child has misused "a volatile substance" (and that phrase "volatile substance" has been deliberately chosen because some of the substances used by children are not necessarily solvents, and it will cover that) by,
<quote>"deliberately inhaling, other than for medicinal purposes, that substance's vapour";</quote>
because the child might inhale a spray for some condition such as asthma, or may accidentally inhale, or it may be a "one-off' and never happen again.<lb/>
I think we are fortunate that we have this system in Scotland. It enables us to take this action, and it is the first recognition of solvent abuse to appear in a statute. It is not the end of the road. It is only the beginning of the road. I know that the Secretary of State for Scotland is awaiting further reports from the people whom he has commissioned to draw up reports as to what else can be done.<lb/>
There are many people who say that we should have inserted a list of all the substances in an Act of Parliament. That is almost impossible to do, because there are so many substances. It is not just glue sniffing. Very often, it is not glue at all. It may be butane gas or something else from an aerosol. There are all kinds of sprays. Children do not know the danger. They are sometimes attracted to the substances by being goaded into it by others. These substances are not necessarily addictive, but they can cause harm and the distress to parents is enormous.<lb/>
There was a fatal accident inquiry in Scotland just the other week. It was a very tragic case, indeed, of a brilliant child who died as a result of this practice. I think that in 1981 there were 33 deaths throughout the whole of the United Kingdom, and in Scotland there were 14. But the Chief Constable of Glasgow reported over 1,700 cases and 11 deaths. There is concern in Strathclyde, Glasgow and the Grampian area, and action is being taken there, with the financial support of the Scottish Office. At the moment, it is all a question of being voluntary and there is a clinic in Glasgow. But there are cases where authority is required, so that a child can be taken with his parents
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0245"/>
<col>475</col>
before a panel and a decision can be made as to treatment. It may well be that the reporter himself will deal with the case and the child may never have to go to a panel. But it may have to do so, and the panel can then decide what should be done. The whole matter is handled privately and quietly, but firmly, and I am sure that this is the best way to make a start.<lb/>
As I said, there are so many substances and, if you put into the Bill a list of what a child can or cannot buy, it could be used by those who want to try these substances. So that is not the way out. The other method is to deal with the person who is supplying. I am glad to say that, in many cities and elsewhere, retailers are deliberately applying strict controls and not selling to children unless they are accompanied by parents. They also want to be assured that such substances will not be used for inhalation. Some kinds of restriction on sales may have to come. It depends very much on what we find out and on the decisions that are taken in cases which are presently before the courts. But that is for the future.<lb/>
This Bill is a big advance in relation to a problem that has been worrying us all. We have discussed it in this House and it has been discussed elsewhere, and at last we have some kind of action. I am sure that, having taken this action, we shall get more information about the extent of the problem. It is not just a town or city problem. There was evidence given in the other House that people in the countryside are also concerned about it. I am glad that there has been such all-round party support for this Bill and I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01859">3.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01860"><member>Lord Mackie of Benshie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should very much like to support this Bill. I do not intend to speak for long, because the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, has covered the field with his usual competence. The Bill, like many of the other things with which he is concerned, is a very sensible and necessary measure, and I am sure that we are all very grateful to him and to the Members of the other place who brought it forward.<lb/>
I should like also to congratulate the Government. It is a pity that we are not in a permanent state of preparing for an election, because all the doctrinaire nonsense has been dropped and what we have done in the last few days has been to pass very sensible measures. In fact, one wondered whether the Government had been sniffing something else&#x2014;such a change there was. If we get these sensible measures through, it will be a great bonus, and if we get other changes after the election period that will be a great bonus, too.<lb/>
An election certainly does something to the Government. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor has chaired us for at least 20 years, but I can only describe his actions as gazelle-like as he put through the Medical Bill. So perhaps the election will do good in many ways, apart from offering the chance of a totally new type of Government. I commend the Bill and I am personally grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, for bringing it forward, because this problem is a great evil in Scotland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01861"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to your Lordships for the fact that my name is not on the list of speakers, but I gave it in late at the Table. The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, on this Bill is of the greatest possible consequence&#x2014;a consequence which far transcends the confines of this Bill, for it is the first step on the road to the statutory recognition of a very serious social evil. It is not the end of the road, as the noble Lord said, but the beginning of it. In welcoming this Bill in its application to compulsory measures of care for children in Scotland, is it not to be hoped that in due course consideration may be given to the creation of a new substantive offence of general application on either side of the border, so that by this means in the main, by magisterial intervention, steps may be taken where appropriate to deal with this type of practice or addiction which, though once trivial, may all too soon assume the proportions of a menace?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01863"><member>Baroness Macleod of Borve</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like very briefly to intervene. I have had quite a lot of experience of dealing with young people and I realise only too well that, both north and south of the border, this addiction is becoming far more prevalent than I think most of us are aware of. It is high time that such a measure was brought before both Houses. So I should like to welcome this measure and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, who has introduced it.<lb/>
I hope that something is also done in the British courts, because, although I am not in favour of its being made a criminal offence, I am very much in favour of the general public, and parents and school teachers in particular, making the children in their care far more aware of the problems that are created by sniffing glue <i>et cetera.</i> Boot polish is another substance. As the noble Lord said, it is almost impossible to prevent children buying these substances. Therefore, in my view, it is up to the adults who have control of these children to try to make them aware of the possibility, not only of injuring their own health or their brains but, as the noble Lord has rightly said&#x2014;and I know some of the figures&#x2014;of dying as a result of sniffing these substances. It is high time that this measure was brought before your Lordships' House and I certainly warmly welcome it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01864">3.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01865"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will have been fascinated to hear about these problems. We are glad to confirm the support of the Government for this Bill and to congratulate both the noble Lord, Lord Ross, and the honourable Member of another place who achieved the unusual distinction of getting a Ten-Minute Rule Bill to this stage in your Lordships' House. Certainly the first thing I shall do on leaving the Chamber is to draw the attention of my noble and learned friend the Lord Advocate, and my right honourable friend, to the encomiums which were so kindly delivered by the noble Lord, Lord Ross. I shall also convey the compliments of my noble neighbour Lord Mackie. I just wonder what my noble neighbour and I sniff, apart from the scent of the noble Lord's
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0246"/>
<col>477</col>
potatoes and soft fruits. But, whatever it is, it has certainly brought his approval and that of his party to the Bill that is before us today.<lb/>
I thank my noble friends Lord Campbell of Alloway and my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve, both of whom. I am sure, appreciate that this short Bill applies only to Scotland. If I may digress, when my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve referred to solvents. I was appalled to hear her refer to boot polish. I have looked at my own shoes which I see may be in need of some treatment, but when I remember that on my way to briefings this morning I observed columns of Grenadier and Coldstream Guardsmen I begin to wonder whether an epidemic of boot polish sniffing is rife in Her Majesty's Brigade of Guards. I shall try to find out whether boot polish is included in the term "solvents".<lb/>
The success of both the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, and the honourable Member for Glasgow, Shettleston, in piloting this measure through both your Lordships' House and another place is indicative of the widespread support throughout Scotland for the proposed action. The Government regard solvent abuse as a foolish and potentially dangerous practice. They are anxious to take or support any action which is likely to be effective in order to discourage the practice and to check its spread. In Scotland, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, the uniquely Scottish institution of the children's panels offers a basis for such action, of which the Bill seeks to take advantage.<lb/>
The Scottish Office conducted a substantial consultative exercise in 1981 and 1982, in which a large number of Scottish bodies and individuals were asked for their views on how solvent abuse should be dealt with. These bodies included health boards, directors of social work, the police associations and a very wide spread of educational and legal interests. Those who responded were almost unanimous in their opposition to the idea that solvent abuse should be made an offence, and very few supported the creation of an offence of selling or supplying solvents to children. A clear majority, however, agreed that there was a valuable role to be played by the children's hearing system in dealing with children identified as caught up in solvent abuse, although they differed on the appropriate means of referring a child to the reporter to the children's panel.<lb/>
After considering this very complex and thorny question at considerable length, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland announced on 16th December last year his intention to seek an apropriate legislative opportunity to introduce a new statutory ground for referral which was linked specifically to solvent abuse. In Scotland, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, and those of your Lordships who are interested in child care north of the Border and who are acquainted with the legal structure in Scotland will know, anybody can refer a child to the reporter to the regional children's panel on any of the grounds set out in Section 32(2) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. When the reporter receives such a referral he has discretion to refer that child to a children's hearing as in need of compulsory measures of care. I should stress that the new ground of referral,
<col>478</col>
which the Bill is intended to introduce, does not make it an offence for a child to inhale solvents but instead defines a circumstance in which he or she may be in need of care and protection. The Bill before us today incorporates a number of Government amendments which were tabled in another place. These amendments, which were welcomed by the sponsor of the Bill in another place, are intended to set out the new ground in the most appropriate and practicable terms.<lb/>
We are of the opinion that the children's hearing will provide a unique opportunity to explore constructively, in an informal setting, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, any personal problems from which a child may be seeking escape by persistent abuse of solvents; or it may hear about any wider family problems which may be putting pressure on the child. The hearing will have the power to impose compulsory measures of care, if this seems likely to be helpful for the individual child. However, I should emphasise that this approach is not, and is not intended to be, a universal remedy, nor would we expect every child detected as being involved in solvent abuse to be referred to a hearing. In most cases the children give up the practice after a short time.<lb/>
The Government would not see this useful piece of legislation as in any way supplanting or substituting for the continuing and developing work of the police, teachers, doctors and nurses, social workers and others whose task involves the counselling and advising of children who are caught up in solvent abuse and of the parents of those children. Again, while all the agencies which are concerned should make parents aware of the help which is available to them, it is the parents themselves who have the primary responsibility and, above all, concern for their children. I hope that the Bill will make a useful contribution to tackling the problem. I commend it most heartily to your Lordships and I congratulate the noble Lord. Lord Ross of Marnock, for bringing it before your Lordships this afternoon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01866"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I ask him whether he would accept that the intervention of my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve was a serious intervention, that it was made in the light of considerable practice and experience and that it ought not to be treated with such levity?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01867"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I accept that my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve has considerable experience of these matters. However, she referred&#x2014;I listened very carefully to her speech&#x2014;to boot polish. If I offended my noble friend Lady Macleod of Borve, I apologise unreservedly.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01868"><member>Viscount Massereene and Ferrard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, may I ask whether this measure will apply to the use by children of snuff? Certain brands of snuff are extremely strong. Is snuff a solvent? My noble friend the Chief Whip is fond of using snuff, but he of course is an adult. However, if very strong snuff were to be used by children it could
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0247"/>
<col>479</col>
be very harmful, especially to the membranes of the nose and to the brain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01869"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know whether snuff is in any way addictive or harmful to the brain or to any of the organs of children or adults. I understand that snuff is not a solvent, as defined by the Bill. If, however, I discover anything about snuff which is in any way harmful to children, I shall certainly inform my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01870"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to those noble Lords who have given a general welcome to the Bill and for the valuable contributions which they have made. I explained in my Second Reading speech, to the frustration of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod of Borve, that this can be done only in Scotland because of the unique nature of the children's hearings. There is no reason why we should hold back. Furthermore, if this had been an English Private Member's Bill it would never have reached this House in time. The noble Lord, Lord Glenkinglas, who was here earlier today, set up a second Scottish Committee in 1960 which enables Private Members' Bills that are purely Scottish in nature not to have to wait in a long queue in another place. They are able to bypass that queue and go straight to that Scottish Committee.<lb/>
This Bill was a Ten-Minute Rule Bill on 1st February. That was only two and a half months ago. It then had to receive its Second Reading in another place, and it then went to the special committee, had its Committee stage, went back to another place for its Report stage and Third Reading, and then eventually came to your Lordships' House. I am sorry to say of the organisation for Private Members' Bills in England and Wales that it cannot normally be done as speedily as that&#x2014;but we have this opportunity and I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod of Borve, will not object if we take it and take it for this particular purpose.<lb/>
The noble Baroness made a very good point (and I am sorry that I missed it) about education. There has to be a fine balance. Suggestions have been made about a great publicity drive, but we have to be careful not to make this matter almost enticing to children by giving it too much publicity. There has to be balanced publicity and I am perfectly certain that the Scottish Health Education Group will be looking into something of that kind.<lb/>
I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for what he said&#x2014;although he left out the very important contribution that the Government made. The Government inserted Clause 2 at Committee stage in another place, and Clause 2 provides the money We could not have done very much about that here. But this does show the dedication there is when we encounter something on which we believe that action must be taken. This point was made in a rather frivolous way by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, but when we see that action has to be taken, and when we see the opportunity to take that action, then we in Scotland can do it. Not for the first time are we leading England&#x2014;and we shall be glad to see England coming along with us.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Industrial Production</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01873">3.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01874"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member> rose to call attention to the Government's record on industrial production and to the need for new and urgent measures to stimulate industrial growth; and to move for Papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01875">The noble Lord said: My Lords, when my colleagues and I chose this subject for debate today, we did not know that a general election was to be held in June. At that time there was a belief that the Prime Minister would "march right down to the end of the road" in a resolute fashion, as she had always given us to understand she would wish to do. Now we are told that the national interest demands a general election. The fact is that weeks of vacillation created uncertainty, and this in turn created a momentum of its own. The vacillation was clearly due to the fear of what may lie at the end of the road in the autumn and early next year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01876">The subject of our debate, however, is especially appropriate at this time. As I want to be perfectly fair to the Government at what is an unsettling time for them, I shall start by saying something upon which everyone in your Lordships' House will agree&#x2014;namely, that Britain's prosperity depends on the success of her industrial performance. That success in turn depends on the one hand on the state of the world economy and on the other on the way in which the Government of the day conduct their industrial and economic policies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01877">It is also fair to say that all Governments since the war, and especially in the past 25 years, have been saddled with enormous problems. What are the words engraved on the hearts of Chancellors of the Exchequer? They are "devaluation", or "the balance of payments", or "inflation". They all reflect the instability of the economic situation, both here and elsewhere.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01878">We in Britain have had to make major adjustments to our policies and attitudes. We have seen our enemies in a war which they lost become our successful competitors in peace. The reaction of some people has been to say, "There ain't no justice". We have witnessed the dissolution of a great empire. For all that it has gone fairly smoothly, this also had a fairly traumatic effect. Dean Acheson said:
<quote>"Britain has lost an empire and not yet found a role".</quote>
We also lost extensive markets for our exports and the benefit of low cost raw materials. We have seen great technological change, and this is continuing apace, as was brought home to us in the Statement on advanced information technology the other day. Successive oil crises involving steep price increases have been another factor.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01879">I have made these fairly obvious points in order to reinforce the argument that all post-war British Governments have had to deal with acute problems,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0248"/>
<col>481</col>
and that various policies have been tried in an effort to resolve them. If I criticise the Government, it is against that background and with an acknowledgement that whichever Government are in power, the task remains a formidable one.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01880">Four years have now passed since the last general election, and we are entitled to make a judgment on the Government's record, bearing in mind their election pledges. The Conservatives said, for example, that they would,
<quote>"concentrate more on the creation of conditions in which new, more modern, more secure, better paid jobs come into existence."</quote>
They went on:
<quote>"This is the best way of helping the unemployed and those threatened with the loss of their jobs in the future".</quote>
They were, as we can all recall, very critical of the level of unemployment under the Labour Government, as they had every right to he. We were certainly concerned about the level of unemployment then&#x2014;although it is important to make the point that more men and women were at work in 1979 than there were in 1974, when we took over from the Government of Mr. Edward Heath.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01881">The Party opposite criticised industrial output under the Labour Government. They said that they were extraordinarily sensitive to the needs of small businesses, and stated, again in their manifesto,
<quote>"To become more prosperous, Britain must become more productive and the British people must be given more incentive."</quote>
This is what they said four years ago. Well, there it is. That was one of the main planks of Conservative policy upon which they won the 1979 general election.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01882">The question we are entitled to ask in this debate is this: has Britain become more productive? Are we a leaner, fitter nation as Conservative propaganda describes it? A good many people are leaner, but I am sure they are not fitter. Largely as a result of this Government's policies we are a poorer, less productive, less prosperous and far more apprehensive nation than we were four years ago.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01883">I do not believe that the noble Lord who is to reply to this debate, or the Prime Minister, or any of her colleagues can claim with any degree of conviction that their policies have succeeded. I venture to predict that when the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, comes to reply he will claim that Government policies are now beginning to work and that the suffering of the past four years has been necessary for the future health and prosperity of the nation. We must look very carefully at those two propositions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01884">After these four years, the facts are grim indeed. Just under 3&#x00B7;3 million people are out of work, with all that implies in economic and social terms. We must remember, too, that the method of calculating unemployment figures has been somewhat altered by the Government. Under the old formula they would have been more than 3&#x00B7;3 million. Furthermore, there are a very large number of women not registered for work who are employable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01885">Under this Government, manufacturing output has been at its lowest level for 15 years. This country, which was the world's first industrial nation, has been running its first ever trade deficit in manufactured goods. The one bonus we have, North Sea oil, tends to
<col>482</col>
conceal the realities of the decline. We have been the victims of the politics of obstinacy, which have worked in a most damaging and callous fashion. In four years our economy has changed in a significant way. It has shrunk more than at any time for 50 years and changed shape faster than at any time since the millions returned from the war in 1945 and 1946.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01886">I spoke of job losses in manufacturing industry, and I recognise that losses in some sectors are inevitable as industries become more capital intensive. If we take the years between 1963 and 1979, manufacturing employment shrank by an average of 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. per annum. Since 1979, the pace of decline has accelerated sharply to 7 per cent. per annum. Other jobs have also been affected. Between 1963 and 1979 public sector employment increased by 2&#x00B7;2 per cent. a year. Since 1979 it has fallen by 1 per cent. a year. We think that the public sector has a vital role to play in the recovery of this country. But even in the private services, where jobs were expanding by 2&#x00B7;4 per cent. per annum between 1963 and 1979, there has been a fall of 1 per cent. since the present Government took office.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01887">My Lords, that is the dismal scene as we survey it this afternoon. No part of Britain has gone unscathed, while some have suffered more deeply than others. What is most depressing is that the region most dependent on manufacturing, the West Midlands, is the worst hit of all. I will come to the signs of possible recovery in a moment, but I must emphasise again that the fall in industrial output in Britain since 1979, with all its consequences in terms of unemployment, in terms of lost resources and of competitiveness, and in its long-term implications for Britain, must be the biggest single failure of this Government over the last four years. Great companies have suffered by contraction, among them firms like Courtaulds, Dunlop, Metal Box, ICI and GKN. One of the most depressing items on television every week is the catalogue of closures and job losses read out by the newscaster.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01888">But it is the small companies which have suffered most, and, mark this, it is the small businesses which the party opposite specifically pledged themselves to help in 1979. We must not forget the Government's statement then:
<quote>"Too much emphasis has been placed on attempts to preserve existing jobs. Government strategies and plans cannot produce revival, nor can subsidies. Where it is in the national interest to help a firm in difficulties, such help must be temporary and tapered".</quote>
As a result of this policy, a large number of small firms have gone to the wall; bankruptcies and insolvencies have increased. A record 12,000 companies failed in Britain last year alone. And it is not only the so-called "lame ducks" which have fallen by the wayside; it is good, promising, fledgling firms which might have succeeded with a little encouragement. There is not a noble Lord in the House who is not aware that that is the case. This has been particularly damaging in areas of high unemployment like Scotland and Wales and the North of England. The Government promised, in the person of the Prime Minister herself, to "maintain strong regional policies". But regional aid in this period has been cut by 44 per cent. by this Conservative Government.</p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0249"/>
<col>483</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01889">The <i>Observer</i> newspaper published some very revealing information about the industrial scene generally last Sunday. They said that is was only desperate measures which had kept many companies going, and that companies making products which have been household names for over a century have closed down or been shut by their parent group. The majority, after a long struggle, have been forced into liquidation or receivership. The <i>Observer</i> says that in some cases&#x2014;and I think this is a point that I must in all fairness make and concede&#x2014;
<quote>"the reasons lie within the company, poor management, unwise expansion, failure to adapt to changing markets or foreign competition".</quote>
But they go on to say that in nearly all cases the collapse has been accelerated by economic conditions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01890">Our charge against the Government is that, allowing for the known difficulties, they failed because of their blinkered monetarist approach to do sufficient to save good well-established firms and small promising firms from extinction. The <i>Observer</i> also gave a list of many of these firms; I will not repeat them now, though I have them before me. It is a depressing and frightening catalogue of firms throughout Britain, from John O'Groats to Lands End, of which we are all aware, which have been closed down not because the managers were incompetent or the workforce idle, but because the Government's policies failed to match up to the challenge of these difficult years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01891">This also needs to be said. If the private sector has taken a hammering, Britain's biggest losers have been in the public sector, steel, airlines, cars and ships. Here again, if the argument is that there was over-manning, which the noble Lord may say in reply, we say that the Government have allowed things to go too far into decline, in many cases beyond the point of no return. There are good firms which have closed their doors, where the buildings are empty, where the grass is growing on the tarmac, which will never open again. It is one of the most depressing features of our time. It is a terrible indictment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01892"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for allowing me to intervene. As he appears to have left the criticism of policy in regard to the small firms, ought he not in fairness take account of the fact that every month in the last year 10,000 new small firms have started up to more than offset in many cases those that have closed down? In a fair presentation should not this be taken into account?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01893"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may return to the weekly list which is catalogued by the newscaster on Independent Television, not only does that list give the names of the firms that have closed down and the numbers of men and women who have lost their jobs, it also gives details of the new jobs that have been created. Of course, we welcome the new jobs, but they are nothing compared to the jobs that have been lost, either in number or in quality.<lb/>
My Lords, we have had enough of this scorched earth policy from the Government. Now that we have well over 3 million people out of work, now that the damage is done, the Government are prepared to spend large sums of money on youth opportunity and youth training. I do not oppose that. I support every reasonable measure which will help young people at
<col>484</col>
this time. But I would say this to the noble Lord and to noble Lords opposite: if the Government had operated a more imaginataive policy, a more sensible and compassionate policy, over the last four years, by putting this &#x00A3;15,000 million to more constructive use in the regions and in help to smaller firms when they needed it, we should not be in the parlous state we are in today. The money would have been invested in jobs and not in training for an uncertain future. The criticism of the Government's present expenditure is that while it is a good thing for these young school-leavers to go into training rather than be on the streets, there is no guarantee of work for them at the end of the 12 months.<lb/>
I hope I shall not be charged with being partisan when I say this, for it is advice which bodies friendly to the Conservative Party, such as the CBI, have been giving to the Government for the past four years. I will not go further into detail about insolvencies, but the House will be aware that the increase in the numbers is very deeply disturbing. May I say in passing that it is a matter of comment that the Government have done nothing about the recommendations of the Cork Report. Sir Kenneth Cork said that the Government&#x2014;and I quote his words, they are not mine&#x2014;would be "stark staring bonkers" not to take action to introduce new legislation. After all the time that has passed since the report was published no action has been taken by the Government in the industrial field on a report which was of the first importance to British industry.<lb/>
There are other critics and, while they are not unfriendly towards the Government, they voice doubts about the firmness of a productivity breakthrough. I hope that we shall hear something from the noble Lord about this. For example, Mr. John Muellbauer in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 20th April, while acknowledging the breakthrough which began in 1980, notes that from the end of 1979 to the end of 1982 the rate of growth was below that for 1970 and that productivity growth is unlikely to rise above that of the 1970s unless there is a substantial recovery in new investment.<lb/>
Again, the NEDC in a report of 30th March dealing with sector assessments has important points to make. To take just one example, the industrial intermediates such as chemicals, plastics, man-made fibres and so on, say they are experiencing the most severe problems. The report states that there are two particular United Kingdom problems: one is the high cost of electricity to energy intensive users compared with their continental competitors, and the second is that rationalisation has proceeded further in the United Kingdom than anywhere else in Europe. That is what has contributed to our unhappy condition today. The question that is raised here is whether the Government are ensuring that our industries are competitive with their European counterparts. The NEDC ends its report by recommending different supporting packages to assist the problems which the sectors face. The Government have not been taking account of what independent observers and advisers have been telling them over the past two or three years.<lb/>
I turn now to the prospects of economic and industrial recovery. We must, of course, welcome any sign of real recovery, and I hope that it is well based
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0250"/>
<col>485</col>
and permanent. We are told that industrial production rose by 0&#x00B7;2 per cent. in January to its highest level for nearly two and a half years, and more than 2 per cent. above a year ago. The Central Statistical Office said that the underlying level of output, adjusted for changes in stocks, was little changed in the latest three months at 2 per cent. to 2&#x00BD; per cent. above its lowest level in spring 1981. It is fair to note, therefore, that any recovery is from a very low point. The CSO also points out that the increase was entirely accounted for by a rise in North Sea oil and gas output and that over the same period other output has shown no change whatsoever.<lb/>
The CBI has welcomed the apparent improvement but has also uttered words of caution. Its deputy president, Sir James Cleminson, stressed that the latest increases
<quote>"were from a very low base"</quote>
although he thought that industrial groups were showing
<quote>"a growth in confidence".</quote>
We must all hope that this confidence is fully justified.<lb/>
There is one matter of the utmost importance. No expert, pundit, or prophet, is able to give us any kind of assurance whatsoever that unemployment will be brought down much below its present appalling level. We believe&#x2014;and I think this applies to all the Opposition parties in the House&#x2014;that positive specific action should be taken to introduce measures to deal with unemployment. The truth is that we all think that the Government have gone too far in their adherence to monetarism. The lives of too many people, in terms of their right to work and their dignity, have been sacrificed on the altar of monetarism. If nothing is done there will be a grim harvest of discontent in this country.<lb/>
We believe that there should be a national plan over five years to co-ordinate expansion and public spending. We believe that there should be a national planning council, involving managements and trade unions. One of the Government's major failures is that they have succeeded in creating a wide gulf between themselves and the unions in this country. They have alienated the very people whose co-operation they so badly need if this country is to recover. We believe that there should be co-ordination and planning with all the leading companies in this country and that regional development plans should be formulated and strengthened.<lb/>
Our chief concern today, however, is with the Government in power. Let me remind the House once more of the chief results of their stewardship over four years. There are nearly 3,300,000 people out of work: one in seven of the labour force in Britain. That is the highest unemployment figure of any industrial country in Europe apart from Spain and is the biggest increase in unemployment in the whole of the industrialised world. There have been 30,000 bankruptcies in the past three years. The fall in employment in manufacturing industry has been deplorable. In metal manufactures it is 37 per cent.; in coal and petroleum products it is 35 per cent.; in textiles, 33 per cent.; in mechanical engineering, 22 per cent.&#x2014;the heart and soul of British manufactures.<lb/>
<col>486</col>
What of the young and the school-leavers? Forty per cent. of the unemployed are under 25, and two out of three school-leavers cannot find work. It is a grim and deeply worrying picture. To cap it all, this unemployment will cost &#x00A3;17 billion in tax revenue and benefits. On a conservative estimate, it costs &#x00A3;5,000 to &#x00A3;6,000 per annum to maintain an unemployed person in unemployment and social security payments, lost income tax, lost VAT and lost national insurance contributions. That is the cost, and that is where the North Sea oil revenues have gone.<lb/>
I must remind the House, once again, what the party opposite said in its 1979 manifesto:
<quote>"The Conservative Government's first job will be to rebuild our economy and to reunite a divided and disillusioned people".</quote>
I regret to say that after four years the nation is far more divided and far more disillusioned than it has been for many decades. The Government have had four years to test their policies. They have shown themselves to be obdurate and unimaginative. They have brought inflation down for the time being&#x2014;and that is the great crusade they boast about&#x2014;but at what price? Their medicine has controlled one disease but it is slowly killing the patient. The moment has come for new men and new measures and, more than that, for a great effort to unite the nation once again and to bring hope where there is despair. That will be our objective over the next few weeks. For Britain's sake, we must succeed. My Lords, I beg to move for Papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01894">4.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01895"><member>Lord Thorneycroft</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a pleasure, as always, and certainly a great honour to reply to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, who delivered an admirably argued speech to the House. It is a speech which is reinforced and elaborated in an admirable document I found in the Library, called <i>New Hope for Britain.</i> From the combination of the two, I should be able to muster a few tentative comments on the remarks that he has made.<lb/>
The noble Lord is right to recognise the gravity of the issues that confront us. Perhaps it is not a bad thing that here in your Lordships' House we should have possibly a rather quieter discussion about some of those problems than may be taking place in the country over the next three weeks. He is right in saying that our prosperity depends in part upon what happens in the world outside but also on how we conduct ourselves against that background. It is about that&#x2014;which is one of the large strategic issues&#x2014;that I want to say a few words this afternoon.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked me one question: are we leaner and fitter as a nation? In a way it is the easiest question to answer. We are leaner and fitter. Go anywhere in industry and you will be told the answer to that one. I wish to God it was the only question that had to be answered&#x0021; There is an enormous parade of other problems, not least among them this massive unemployment. As the noble Lord said, it has not been under one Government or for a few years. For something like 20 years or more, our record has been less good than we would wish. On jobs, growth, productivity and competitiveness we have not matched our rivals in the world. It is time that we all had deep thoughts about how to tackle problems of that character.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0251"/>
<col>487</col>
I want to compress my remarks into one area, which is how we tackle the main trading structure of this nation. I agree with the noble Lord that, unless we get that right, none of the rest will work at all. We can all spend hours swapping statistics and taking the ones which look the most attractive for the moment. I am sure that that will go on a great deal in the future. But I want to talk about the strategy and the way we tackle the thing. I agree with the noble Lord that both private and public interests have a huge part to play. I think we are all delighted that Lord Ezra will be speaking in this debate. I have respected him, and the great contribution he made in the coal industry, for many years.<lb/>
For my part, I want to talk about that structure. I want to talk about markets. Lord Ezra, with all his experience of coal, may agree with nothing else, but, if I may say so, he will agree that markets at least matter. If we do not have the markets, nothing else&#x2014;no expenditure of money; no nothing&#x2014;will help. That is the structure of world trade. I do not know everything about it, obviously, but I know a little about this subject. I was President of the Board of Trade for five years and Chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board, and I have worked in industry and exports most of my life. Even if I do not know all the answers, at least I know the topic.<lb/>
To give just one short recollection, nearly 30 years ago I was a member of a British Cabinet, a Tory one. Winston Churchill was its Prime Minister. Leo Amery and the old guard of the Tory Party were great believers in imperial preference. At the party conference they had put down a motion attacking the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I wanted to oppose it. The Cabinet thought I should lose, and I remember Winston saying, "Let him try". It is a rather dangerous thing to say just before an election, but there was always a good liberal element in Winston Churchill, and he was always for having a go. At any rate, we tried, and won. That moment marked&#x2014;not my speech or that victory&#x2014;a sea change in the structure of world trade. It meant the moving of this country out of the narrower world of imperial preference into the world of what was then known as wider trade and payments; and it is in that world that we live with international trade rules. Part of my argument now will be that the preservation of international trade rules is of immense importance to this country. Whatever our difficulties, they are likely to be made far worse if we abandon that trading system.<lb/>
It seems to me that today we are at another such point. I shall try to describe why. The policy which Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos has been arguing (or the background to the speech that he made and which is contained in this Labour Party document) is to inflate the economy. I shall not do all the debating on inflating the economy which will no doubt be gone into. It is set out brilliantly in paragraph 10 of this document. I need not lend it to the noble Lord: I am sure he has it. But there is not the slightest doubt that they intend to inflate the economy, and the effects of this inflation are, as a matter of fact, admitted in the Labour Party document. They are not challenged. They are, I think, sometimes a little more obscured by the SDP, but they are admitted here. They are that there will be a demand for higher wages&#x2014;that is
<col>488</col>
openly said&#x2014;and that prices will tend to go up. I shall not argue those areas&#x2014;not today. The most important effect is that there would be a surge of imports, and that is acknowledged. They then seek to tackle the problem of that surge of imports.<lb/>
What they propose to do is to stop them by controls, tariffs and quotas. All of that is in direct contravention of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the trading rules and regulations under which our export trade is conducted at the present time. They then go on to say they will leave the Common Market. I am not arguing in detail the rights and wrongs of all that. What I am saying is that it is inevitable in their policy that they say these things. Once you have decided to embark upon inflation as a policy, you are committed to these consequential events. You cannot inflate in this country and leave it under the trading system that exists today.<lb/>
In a way I respect their frankness. I am bound to say that my vision of an inflated island economy protected against the rest of the world I view with horror, but I am not here to talk about the horror I feel. I am here to deal with the facts. I am saying that, once you embark upon this policy, you break those rules. I think it would probably be disastrous for this country. I think, incidentally, that it would be disastrous for the third world. If there is one fear that the third world has at this moment it is that the developed world may embark upon a continuing policy of protection. If I may say so to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, for the Labour Party to be the leaders in that advance&#x2014;or retreat, as I had better call it&#x2014;into a protectionist world, is a matter to which I hope the British people will give the gravest consideration.<lb/>
No country, not even this one, is an island. We export from this country about a third of everything that we make. I think Winston Churchill once said that if we stopped exporting like that, half the population would have to leave; and he pointed out that there might be quite a debate about which half. I cannot conceive of this country deprived of exports on that kind of level. We are&#x2014;and I would ask the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, to follow me closely here&#x2014;very vulnerable to retaliation, perhaps much more vulnerable than any other great trading nation in the world. We are vulnerable because we export much more. In this country our exports <i>per capita</i> are far greater than those of Japan, the United States of America, or France. So if we start the tit-for-tat battle of import quotas and the rest, we can be hit far harder than we can hit back.<lb/>
At the moment, notwithstanding all the difficulties, the recession, and all that, in world trade this country is placed in a remarkably advantageous position. We have the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. There is no discrimination against us. We must pause before we enter a world in which everybody can discriminate against everybody else. That would be a chaotic world for anybody in which to trade, let alone one of the greatest exporters in the world.<lb/>
Not only do we have that position. Within the general rules we have a big preferential area of trade in Europe. We have enormous advantages from that. If we leave Europe, what do we negotiate, and with whom? What on earth do we do? If we leave Europe, we cannot have a half preference area. We would never
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0252"/>
<col>489</col>
negotiate that with the rest of the world. If we think that we can just make any deal we like, irrespective of the world outside Europe, what happens to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? Is it part of the policy of the Labour Party to renegotiate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as well? It has never said so. I should be interested if anyone who is to take part in today's debate can give us a hint of what would be the broad parameters of such talks. I do not ask for an indication of what would be the results, but rather some idea of what kind of approach there would be to such negotiations.<lb/>
We are not allowed to have, and no one would ever negotiate with us, a half preference area in Europe. Anybody with even only the most elementary ideas of what goes on in international trading would know that that was not possible. So, if we leave Europe, we are already in trouble, and, if we try to renegotiate, we are in far deeper trouble still. I would beg the Labour Party to think before it tears up this sytem of trading. When I was arguing with Leo Amery 25 or 30 years ago, at least he had a case. He stood for imperial preference. It was there. It was something; and he was doubtful about the GATT. But we are asked to leave the GATT and Europe for a dream. It would be the wildest gamble, and I believe that many noble Lords opposite know it. It is an action that should be considered before the Labour Party finally does it.<lb/>
There are other consequences to consider. Production, growth, and jobs depend upon investment, and investment depends in part upon profits. But there is also a dependence upon foreign investment. Who is going to invest in this country as a small, protected island, inflating its economy, largely cut off from the world of wider payments and trade? Who is going to invest in such a country? Will the Americans put in money? Will the Japanese put in money? And what happens to the jobs? If the Labour Party want to fight the election on the employment question, so be it. Let it explain to those who are seeking jobs in this country how on earth their future is going to be secure in a narrow, separated, isolated condition of that kind&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01896"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord allow me to intervene? I have listened with some fascination to his speech, bringing back memories of the 'thirties and speculating on what will happen if some of the courses which he has interpreted were to be Labour Party policy; for instance, disrupting the GATT, and leaving the Common Market. We are in the most disastrous situation we have ever been in since the end of the war; we are adhering to the GATT, and we are still in the Common Market. That is what this debate is about.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01897"><member>Lord Thorneycroft</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord's point is a perfectly fair one. If as a nation we find ourselves in great difficulties, with grave problems, against a background of international trade such as it is today, we must not, for heaven's sake, worsen that background. I say, do not deprive us of such advantages as we have. Do not kick us in the teeth at the very moment when we want everybody to have the maximum advantages.<lb/>
<col>490</col>
It seems to me that if those policies were pursued, we should lose large parts of our export trade. We should lose the preferential advantages of being in Europe. We should lose the benefits of the trading rules on non-discrimination, without which, frankly, I do not know how our exporters in this country would be able to exist. We should lose most of the foreign investment coming in. We should lose a good slice of our invisible trade, which hangs upon the success of international trade and is of inestimable value to us. We should lose jobs. I trust that, against that background, at least the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and, I hope, some other noble Lords who are to take part in the debate, will urge caution before the policies which the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, has commended are pursued.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01898">4.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01899"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, for introducing this very important debate, particularly at this time. I do not believe that your Lordships' House could be debating a subject of greater importance than this one, nor at a more relevant time. As a relatively newly-arrived Member of your Lordships' assembly, I regard it as a very great honour to be able to participate in the debate. I also regard it as a very great honour to be speaking after the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, whom I have known for many years during the course of his very distiguished career. I have had the opportunity of working closely with him, particularly when he was the first chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board. I fully concur with his view, which he so eloquently expressed, that we must do everything within our might to develop our trading position in a free and liberalised trading world.<lb/>
The acuteness of the industrial situation that faces this country needs no demonstration. I had come today laden with statistics, but I shall spare your Lordships a recital of them because I am sure that all the basic statistics are well known. The question that arises is what we are going to do about the situation from now on. That is the issue to which I should like to try and address my mind. In the first place, we need to analyse and decide clearly where we are. There are indications of some revival, but, on all sides of this House and throughout the country, everyone is uttering words of caution over how we treat this revival. We were caught out, about this time last year, when we thought that things were getting better, but they did not. Maybe, this time round, they will continue to get better, but the situation is undoubtedly very patchy.<lb/>
There is a revival in a few sectors of industry, but not in most. There is a revival in some enterprises, but not in most. There are signs of revival in some parts of the country, but not in most. So this is apparently a very delicate plant.<lb/>
Furthermore, I believe that one of the effects of present policies pursued by the Government may be stimulating the patchy nature of this revival. As emphasised in an exchange earlier in this debate, the Government have paid a great deal of attention to stimulating small businesses. No one denies that this is very important. Equally, they have devoted a great deal of attention and are spending a considerable amount of money on stimulating high technology.
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0253"/>
<col>491</col>
They have recently devoted, I believe, the very large sum of &#x00A3;350 million to the stimulus of research in the fifth generation of computers. That is very important. But the fact is that the vast mass of British industry lies between those two areas; that is, between the small enterprise sector, on the one hand, and the high technology emerging sector, on the other.<lb/>
There are the large basic industries; there are the construction industries; there are the big engineering industries; and there is the bulk of manufacturing industry. It seems from the statistics that the maufacturing sector as a whole has suffered most. If you look at the published statistics&#x2014;I hope I shall be forgiven for quoting one set of statistics&#x2014;they show that, comparing the year 1979 and the year 1982, the last full year, activity in our manufacturing industries has diminished by 15 per cent. This figure has to be compared with those in France and Germany, our two main competitors on the continent, where the diminution has been of the order of 4 per cent.<lb/>
Undoubtedly, the world situation has played its part. But the difference between us and our main comparable continental competitors suggests that there are other special factors on the British scene. One of those factors, in my view, is that as a result of various policies pursued in recent years we have had a massive reduction in the proportion of investment in our industrial sector. This is, I believe, the most serious aspect of our present situation. What can we do about correcting this without again rushing headlong into inflation? Undoubtedly, the conquest of inflation that the Government have achieved is very important. There are however other aspects in our economic affairs. The health of our industrial economy is also of vital importance. I believe that the time has come when we have to address ourselves much more seriously to that problem. How can this be done in a sensible and rational manner? No one can give a complete answer. If they could, I have no doubt that they would be the people most in demand in this country. At least, however, some suggestions can be made.<lb/>
I should like to draw upon my own industrial experience to suggest what I believe can contribute. We have to start with our infrastructure, with the fabric of our country. I believe that the fabric of Britain today is reaching a stage of progressive decrepitude and that it needs renovation and repair. In your Lordships' House only recently there was an important and well-informed debate on the water industry. That debate, supported by Members from all sides, demonstrated that there is a progressive deterioration in the systems supplying us with water and dealing with sewage. But because it is largely unseen and still somehow working, nothing much has been done. Like the householder who can try to ignore the odd leakage through the roof hoping that somehow it will go away, we know from our own domestic experience that if we ignore the first signs of decrepitude the bill that we have to pay at the end of the day is very much larger.<lb/>
Looking at the fabric of our country, consisting not only of water supply and sewerage systems but also of roads, railways, public buildings and edifices and public housing, it seems to me that these are all things to which we should now be giving special attention. We have given them diminished attention over the
<col>492</col>
past few years. In a discussion with the Institution of Civil Engineers the other day I was shown conclusively how public sector construction and maintenance work coming to its members&#x2014;all of them are in the private sector&#x2014;has been diminishing radically over recent years. This question of the fabric therefore seems to me to be of vital importance, not only because it is sadly in need of repair but also because, in the present state of world economic affairs, this is precisely the right time to get the fabric right. If we wish to get the maximum benefit possible from what might he a slow but, it is to be hoped, certain recovery in the world economy, let us for goodness' sake start from a firm base. Let us not find that our efforts, in due course, are hampered by the fabric giving way.<lb/>
I can say from my personal experience that when you try to do these things at a time of strong recovery the resources are not available. The construction resources and the skill resources will not be there; they will be tied up in other things that attract a quicker return. Those things I am talking about will only provide a slow return in money terms but a vital return in terms of' what the country can contribute towards stimulating recovery.<lb/>
There is a related aspect to which I should like to draw your Lordships' attention, again based on my own industrial experience. If a really determined effort is directed towards major public investment projects, it is possible to have them supplied and constructed on a competitive basis from British sources. The effect of going into carefully-selected public projects, which will largely require the services of the private sector in order to get our infrastructure right, can be stimulated by positive purchasing policies. My own experience in the coal industry, which has a purchasing bill of &#x00A3;1,000 million a year, was that we set out deliberately to stimulate suppliers from Britain to quote and to get the business on a competitive basis. There was no question of buying British at any price. We must not fall into that trap. We must make sure that the British resource is a competitive resource, and, at the end of my time, on that basis we were obtaining no less than 97 per cent. of all that we purchased in the way of goods and services from competitive British sources. If we were to launch into a desirable, carefully coordinated series of capital projects to get the fabric (as I have called it) right, and if we were to make sure that competitive supplies and services were provided from within our own resources in this country, that could have an instant impact not only upon the creation of wealth but also upon employment.<lb/>
There is a third related aspect to this which, again, I can draw on my own experience to illustrate. If we were to co-ordinate our work on major projects in that way, carefully thought-out, supplied and constructed on a competitive basis, we would build up&#x2014;and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, will appreciate this&#x2014;an increased export capability. This was certainly the case in the coal industry in my time, because by making absolutely sure that we stimulated the technologies among the mining machinery manufacturers, all of whom were in the private sector, we were able not only to advance the technology within our own pits and to improve our performance but also to provide them with much increased export opportunities. Therefore, I believe that on the back of
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0254"/>
<col>493</col>
carefully selected major capital projects to improve, repair and renovate the basic structure of Britain we can ensure that this works its way through the industrial economy and that it gives substantial additional work at a time when it is needed to the sorely-pressed construction and engineering industries, and, through them, to their subcontractors. Thus it would work its way positively through the economy.<lb/>
As a result of that we could also get increased employment at a time when it is obviously needed, and increase our export capability. I believe that the time has come for a positive, vigorous, carefully thought-out policy to be adopted along those lines. I believe that it can be adopted without risk of a renewed inflationary surge. On the contrary, I believe that such a policy could contribute to increasing our national wealth, increasing employment and increasing our overseas earnings.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01901"><member>Lord Gallacher</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have opted to speak on a somewhat controversial subject, as the debate so far has shown, but I hope to do this in a non-controversial way. If I stray over the narrow dividing line, I hope for the understanding which I am told your Lordships usually extend to first-year apprentices.<lb/>
The main concern of employers and workers has been and is that, at a time of world recession, aggravated by the rise in world oil prices, Britain opted for strong deflationary policies which made the position difficult for the nation as a whole. Technological change, combined with dearer money, has meant considerable hardship for industry. Liquidity problems alone have forced the closure of many firms and serious reductions in the labour force of those continuing in business.<lb/>
Unemployment figures are serious both in terms of their taxation cost and the unused resources which they represent. Business confidence is a fragile affair. Once lost, it is difficult to restore the willingness to invest. If interest rates are historically high, even those who wish to borrow are deterred because they are doubtful of their ability to meet lending charges.<lb/>
If insufficient taxable profits have been made, there is no offset against loan charges, so the firm, be it large or small, is in a trading situation from which it is difficult to break out. Cheaper money is essential to recovery.<lb/>
In another place a Question was answered on 4th May about the total industrial investment in Britain as a proportion of gross national product for the years 1962 and 1982. The reply indicated that, in percentage terms, United Kingdom investment in industries covered by the index of industrial production, including assets leased from service industries, expressed as a percentage of gross national product was 6&#x00B7;9 per cent. in 1962 but only 5&#x00B7;3 per cent. in 1982.<lb/>
In the economic indicators section of British business for the period 6th to 12th May 1983 there is further evidence of the slow rate of recovery despite a more optimistic CBI industrial trends survey for the quarter ended April 1983. For example, in three months to February 1983 the manufacturing index
<col>494</col>
was only 1 per cent. higher than in the previous three months and unchanged from the same time a year earlier.<lb/>
CBI forecasts suffer from the absence of information about retailing, although I am aware that attempts are being made to provide for a retailing input. The abolition of statutory deposits for hire purchase in July last undoubtedly boosted credit sales of certain consumer durables, but there are limits to the extent of this, particularly on an on-going basis, as even consumers need to be confident before getting too heavily into debt. Thus consumers' expenditure on the Department of Trade's preliminary estimate and in volume terms was virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 1983, so the increases in the last quarter of 1982 are just about being maintained. In any case, a large part of consumer durables represents imported goods, so the benefit to British industry is reduced by the extent to which foreign makes are chosen. The same comments apply, unfortunately, to clothing and footwear sales.<lb/>
Both the TUC and CBI have asked the Government for some reflation to ease the problems of workers and employers, but so far the response has not been significant. Of course, there are sharp differences between the TUC and CBI about the amount and nature of the expansion they wish to see, but there is mutual concern about the state of economic activity and there must surely be a more positive response by Government this year.<lb/>
Industry feels that it faces an uphill task in a recessionary situation. If the pound is strong, exporting is difficult. If the pound weakens, particularly against the dollar, interest rates rise. In either event, industrial costs, particularly energy, seem high to manufacturers by comparison with those payable by competitors, especially in the EEC, which are poor in energy resources by comparison with the United Kingdom. There now appears to be an acceptance of the manufacturers' cost problems, but it has taken some years, much advocacy, and not a few business failures to obtain recognition of industry's need for a better competitive base.<lb/>
The encouragement of small firms is particularly welcome in this the European year of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises. The Government's continuing assistance is both practical and timely. It represents a continuation of policies initiated by the previous Administration in which my noble friend Lord Lever played a significant part.<lb/>
The new firm does, however, need a sympathetic economic environment if it is to flourish. Dear money and low demand represent a harsh climate for any business, but particularly for a new one. It is to be hoped that the Government will follow through what they seek to do for small business by giving them a fair economic wind in their early years. Without this, the failures could exceed the beginners so that their contribution to employment creation will be much less than everyone hopes. Large firms are still the dominant employers in the United Kingdom and they too need easier monetary policies. The tragedy of business failure is no less great because one is not personally touched by it. When established firms go to the wall, employment is lost and so, too, is capital.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0255"/>
<col>495</col>
Provision for bad debts by joint stock banks is a barometer of the state of the nation. Very substantial debt appropriations have been made by most banks in recent years. Although a large part of this relates to overseas lending, enough is in respect of United Kingdom firms to at least call in question the nature and extent of the recovery process which is said to be under way.<lb/>
Perhaps the saddest feature of the decline in industrial activity is the manner in which it has spread throughout all regions. Britain now has problems in every region. This makes selective assistance on a geographical basis an arbitrary process. The longer recovery is delayed the greater will be the totality of the problem. The retail price index in March showed a year on year increase of 4&#x00B7;6 per cent. The cost of achieving this, in both economic and social terms, has been high, yet borrowing rates are still of the order of 12 per cent. to 13 per cent. even for good class risks. Surely this differential is too high.<lb/>
Government is best able to prime the investment pump. It must encourage the country to believe that it is prepared to play a positive part in economic revival. At present, Treasury responses have been a disappointment, especially following the last tripartite meeting of the National Economic Development Council. The extent to which pump priming encourages capital expenditure over revenue spending is a matter for ministerial decision. What is certain is that too many industries have suffered, some grievously, and too many people who ought to be employed are unemployed. That coincidence of adversity may yet threaten the social stability of Britain, although no one wishes to see this.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01903"><member>Lord Harris of High Cross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a great pleasure to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, on his highly competent, well-informed, and cogent maiden speech. He said at the outset that he was launching himself on somewhat controversial waters, but I think we can all agree that he managed to keep upright, and we look forward to hearing from him again in our future debates. At the other end of the spectrum from the maiden speaker it was, as always, a joy to hear the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, whom I commend to Lord Gallacher as a model of the old hand that none of us can ever quite emulate. I was particularly delighted, as a free trader, to hear his formidable case against the temptations&#x2014;not only for the Labour Party but also for Conservative Ministers&#x2014;to drift into the short-term expedient of restriction on trade.<lb/>
I turn to the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn. I must congratulate him on the remarkable timeliness of this Motion criticising the Government's record at a time when we approach the full light, or it may prove twilight, of the general election campaign. As always, it is easier for me to admire the manner of the noble Lord rather than the matter. Indeed, as he got into his stride&#x2014;and I listened to his decorous but effective battering of the Government&#x2014;I was reminded of the Irishman who asked, "Is this a private fight, or can anyone join in?" I have a contribution to make that will, I hope, complement something he said, because he referred fairly briefly at the beginning
<col>496</col>
to the long history of post-war economic difficulties which have enveloped Governments of all parties. But naturally he moved on quickly to the more controversial matters of the last Government's record since 1979.<lb/>
My Lords, I hope it might be of service if I try to fill in something of the missing background to that speech, because we must go back well before 1979 if we are to make any kind of judgment on recent developments. For example, have any of us forgotten all the endless agonising in the 1960s and 1970s over the British disease? Does the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, not recall all the talk of the economic league tables which showed our progressive decline from among the leaders to a straggling laggard in real income per head of developed nations?<lb/>
I doubt if anyone in the House easily remembers the post-war Anglo-American Council of Productivity which brought together the TUC and the Federation of British Industries in a rare search for ways of achieving greater efficiency. In 1953 it published a report with the hopeful title, <i>We Too Can Prosper,</i> which makes instructive reading some 30 years later. The author of this report was Mr. Graham Hutton, a lifelong friend of mine. I recently read again with special care that he attributed the better performance of United States industry chiefly to their more intensive use of modern machines through the greater flexibility and mobility of labour. In contrast, Mr. Hutton referred to the strong Luddite tradition of British trade unions which, allied to weak management, he thought had given rise to what he then explicitly called, "concealed unemployment". It is my view that it has been, above all, the failure of managements to tackle restrictive practices in industry that explains Britain's long relative economic decline.<lb/>
Of course, over all that period politicians have made endless speeches about productivity. The Conservative Party, it may be remembered, invented the National Economic Development Council, and the Labour Party conjured up national plans without number, and largely without effect. Both parties multiplied subsidies; at one time for capital investment, and then for the employment of labour. But I would argue that no sustained progress was made until after 1979.<lb/>
If we go back to 1964 when a certain Prime Minister was lighting his pipe by what he called, "the white heat of a technological revolution", at the very same time an American consultant, William Allen, hit the headlines in the <i>Sunday Times</i> with an article asking:
<quote>"Is Britain a half-time country, getting half pay for half work under half-hearted management?"</quote>
His bleak answer gave countless examples from many differing industries where it took two or three British workers to produce as much as one in other countries, often with similar plant.<lb/>
Two years after William Allen's article there was a debate in this House in May 1966 when the noble Lord, Lord Byers, from the Liberal Benches opened a discussion on the need to increase efficiency. In that debate he estimated that,
<quote>"between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. of the working population was under-employed".</quote>
In the same debate, the noble Lord, Lord Shawcross, claimed that there was:
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0256"/>
<col>497</col>
<quote>"concealed under-employment of at least 2 million men and women",</quote>
and he went on to argue that they would be available in expansionary times for redeployment in other industries and services.<lb/>
If all this is even approximately true of that period, we are bound to ask why was it that managements and unions failed to grasp the nettle of slack working habits. I believe it is a non-political revelation that these restrictive practices were deeply embedded in industry and indeed go back more than half a century to the birth of British trade unionism.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01904"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord would permit me, before he leaves the question of restrictive practices and William Allen in particular, to ask this question. Would he not recognise that Mr. Allen's success in the Esso refinery in Fawley shows that it was management that was at fault rather than the unions' restrictive practices?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01905"><member>Lord Harris of High Cross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must defer this argument to another occasion. I would by no means exempt management from a large share of the blame, but I am coming on to ask why did not management do something about it. I am saying, first of all, that the restrictions of which I talk were deep-seated and had come to be widely accepted. I want to remind noble Lords that when we look even in recent years to examples in printing, in the docks, in railways, in shipbuilding, even, alas&#x0021; recently in the car industry, we find that where managements do tackle restrictive practices or overmanning they are in for costly battles which, in some cases, can set a term to the existence of their companies. But, above all, against the confrontation that would have been involved to tackle these problems, it was so much easier for the CBI and the TUC to get together at their cosy meetings and to press Government to stimulate demand for inefficient labour in the sacred name of Keynesian full employment policies. That is the nub of my criticism of that period. I believe it has been the major cause of Britain's record inflation, and I think it is also the explanation of Britain's poor record of growth and the consequent industrial decline.<lb/>
The lesson that is ignored by today's self-styled "reflationists" is that monetary expansion&#x2014;though again and again intended as a stimulant to employment and growth&#x2014;simply acted as a sedative that sapped the will to tackle the root causes of our poor industrial performance. Even worse, these political pep pills became addictive, so that increasing doses yielded a diminishing effect on employment and output, with worsening side-effects on inflation. As Hayek has pointed out, more and more jobs became dependent not only on the continuation of inflation, but on its acceleration. That helps to explain why the Labour Government's success after 1974 in getting inflation down pushed unemployment up&#x2014;under a Labour Government&#x2014;very close to 1&#x00BD; million.<lb/>
It is true that the real wages of British workers rose more slowly than elsewhere, but they still rose faster than flagging output. Positive proof of this among a great many conflicting statistics is shown by the decline in the real rate of return on capital from an
<col>498</col>
average of 10 per cent. in the 1960s to below 5 per cent. in 1979, which was an ill omen of higher unemployment still to come.<lb/>
The crime with which this Government are charged is simply that they have refused to accommodate the higher inflation that would have been necessary to keep workers in over-priced jobs. The Government are not guilty of reducing or deflating demand, but only of allowing demand to grow more slowly to bring inflation down from above 20 per cent. to below 5 per cent. In the process of so doing, the concealed unemployment of the 1950s and 1960s has come out into the open and onto the register. I agree that it is nothing less than a tragedy that this long-overdue corrective for the enfeebling British disease coincided with a record world recession on top of a structural shift of industry into new products and new sources of supply for older products.<lb/>
I conclude with the thought that there is a silver lining to the heavy clouds of unemployment. It is that in many sectors of industry there has been a dramatic rise in productivity since management and trade unions found that they could not take the soft option of inflating their costs and their prices. As I have said before, Mrs. Thatcher is like the wife who has hidden the gin&#x2014;and that is not popular, especially among old soaks, who are by no means confined to the Labour Benches. I believe it gives us the best chance since the war to expand our production and employment as the world recovers from a recession which has been little more than a return to earth after the prolonged illusory joy-ride of international monetary inflation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01907"><member>Lord Jacques</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I first congratulate my noble friend Lord Gallacher on his maiden speech. It was just right in length, in content and in tone. I have known my noble friend for 40 years at relatively close quarters. I believe that because of his personal qualities and his experience he can make a substantial contribution to the work of this House.<lb/>
Within the next few days we shall be starting an election, and one of the choices which our people will have is whether they want a managed economy or a market economy. A managed economy is not the same but similar to what we had in the first 20 years after the war. In spite of all the problems and all the criticisms that we may have of the first 20 to 25 years after the war, let us remember that it was that economy which gave us full employment: it was the economy which gave us the welfare state; it was that economy which doubled our standard of living in real terms. It did not do so badly.<lb/>
The alternative is a market economy; that is to say, an economy in which we depend too much on market forces; so much so that for prolonged periods our resources are not fully used. Because our resources are not fully used, we cannot afford the welfare state except by frittering away our receipts from North Sea oil and by selling assets that we should retain because they would be useful to the nation. Those are the only terms on which we can keep our welfare state. Without those sources of income, the welfare state would have been devastated in the last four years.<lb/>
Our unemployment is not primarily due to the international recession. The recession affects not only
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0257"/>
<col>499</col>
this country; it is international. The figures which compare our country with other similar countries show that our suffering has been greater. For example, our real gross national product has declined by 2&#x00B7;5 per cent. since 1979, but in other Western countries, plus Japan, which are members of the OECD, there has been an increase of 3&#x00B7;4 per cent. in their GNP; about 6 per cent. difference between their perfomance and ours. In 1979, our unemployment was only one half of 1 per cent. more than the average for the OECD countries. Now, it is 4&#x00BD; per cent. more.<lb/>
It is quite clear from these figures that the primary cause of our increased unemployment is not the recession. Nor, is it technical improvement, including the use of the chip, that increases productivity. Technical improvement reduces cost. It reduces prices. It increases our real income. It increases demand for other goods and services. It does not create massive unemployment.<lb/>
The primary cause of our unemployment is the method that has been used to control inflation. There is a choice of method, but the method that has been used during the last four years has caused havoc. Due to over-reliance upon the control of money, we have had excessive interest rates. What does the phrase "excessive interest rates" mean? It means that the survival of a firm does not depend in its efficiency, but upon how far it is dependent upon capital at the current rate of interest. If it is not dependent upon borrowed capital, it will find it easy to survive, but if it is, it will find survival quite difficult, no matter how efficient the firm might be.<lb/>
This policy also gave us a false exchange rate for sterling because it did not reflect domestic prices. Because the exchange rate did not reflect domestic prices, it was kept high to reduce the costs of our imports and therefore our inflation. However, at the same time, it made it exceedingly difficult for our industry to export and, at the worst period, our exporters were at a disadvantage of 50 per cent.&#x2014;something which has not been known before in any industrial country. Even today, after the depreciation of the pound in the last few months, our exporters are at a disadvantage of 25 per cent. so that we have quite a way to go before they are put in a reasonable position for competing on the world market. These things have caused the unemployment, and the economic policy has been to rely upon these things causing the unemployment, because that was the way of controlling inflation. Unemployment damped down the demand for increased wages because of the fear of unemployment. Consequently, we had control of inflation by fear rather than a more constructive control.<lb/>
There must be an alternative to that. It is uncivilised. I believe that this is the alternative. Instead of trying to put the trade unions in a straitjacket, which recent legislation has attempted, we should have consultation with them, consultation at national level. At local level, the members of trade unions should be treated as partners in the business. If we do that, then we shall get much better industrial relations and a civilised control over inflation.<lb/>
I should like to commend to the House an industrial relations agreement negotiated between Toshiba, the
<col>500</col>
Japanese electrical firm, and the electricians' trade union. Some time ago they negotiated an agreement on consultation and negotiating procedures and, in the words of the trade union officials, "It is an agreement in which our members are treated as partners and not as servants". That is the first thing that has got to be realised in any industrial negotiation. This particular agreement has embodied in it a clause which lays down that, in any difference on wages and working conditions between the company and the trade union, the matter shall be referred to an independent arbitrator who shall make an award either to the company or to the trade union, but shall not compromise.<lb/>
That brings something new into industrial relations. It means that there is a discipline which may hitherto have been absent: both sides tend to be more responsible because, if they are not more responsible, then the arbitrator is likely to give the award to the other party. I believe that, by looking at agreements of this kind, we can improve our industrial relations and, if we improve our industrial relations, we shall be able to have methods of controlling inflation which are far more civilised than the method that we have used in the past four years.<lb/>
Finally, I would say that the present indications of a sound recovery are not there. We are investing in manufacturing industry 26 per cent. less than we did in 1979. Equally important, we have 40 per cent. less apprenticeships in industry than we had in 1979&#2013;40 per cent. less&#x0021; This is not the stuff upon which we can rebuild the future. We need something much more positive than that. We certainly need much more investment and, on the supply side, we need to give confidence. I believe that we can give that confidence if we improve industrial relations on the lines which I have indicated. I believe that it is the biggest hindrance to reinvestment. On the demand side, we have to reduce drastically the rate of interest; we have to do everything necessary to reduce the rate of interest.<lb/>
In particular, we have to have exchange controls so that the savings of our people in pensions and insurance are not invested abroad to take away their jobs. We want the money invested here. If firms and employees contribute to pension schemes, it is in their interest and in the nation's interest that the money should be invested here and that we should create conditions in which that money can be invested here. The choice of the nation in economic policy in the next few years is whether we are going to do these things consciously and manage them or whether we are going to rely abnormally upon the forces of the market.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01909"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me add my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher. I hope that he will contribute often to our debates. Let me also say to the noble Lord&#x2014;for whom I have great respect&#x2014;who introduced this most important debate that I have sufficient regard for his timing in placing the Motion at this time to say that I think he has done the House of Lords a great service in putting on this extremely important debate on a subject on which we shall be no doubt hearing a great deal more throughout the election. In particular at this moment, our
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0258"/>
<col>501</col>
industrial recovery, the building of new wealth for this country, is the prerequisite of every desirable facet of national life. There can be no more important subject. Neither can the level of unemployment&#x2014;which doubled in the final years of the last Labour Government and which has gone on increasing ever since&#x2014;leave any of us other than most worried and determined to try to work out the best way to create real jobs.<lb/>
Having said that, I confess that I was nearly speechless with astonishment at some of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos. Fortunately or unfortunately, as you wish to view it, I was not quite speechless and, as a yesterday Tory "wet" Minister at the DoI, I intend to make some comments which should perhaps be entitled not so much <i>The Confessions of a Wet</i> as the <i>The Conversion of a Wet.</i> I am sorry that my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft, who made such a marvellous contribution to our debate today, is not present to hear me say that in fact I started to dry out at about the moment when he was reported to be experiencing a feeling of rising damp.<lb/>
However that may be, let me come to the reasons for my astonishment that a man of the eminence of Lord Cledwyn&#x2014;whom I have known for a long time and who was in ministerial office when I was outside it in industry&#x2014;should have made some of the remarks that he made today. It was tenable to hold those views in, say, 1979; but I believe that they are not tenable at a moment when British industry generally is proving that it is internationally competitive for the first time in over 20 years. Of course, there is the patchiness that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, mentioned and, of course, it is not in each and every industry; but, in fact, in a static and stagnant market we have levelled out; and you cannot do that if you are not competitive overall.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hams of High Cross, made a valuable contribution on the hidden unemployment of the years in the '60s and '70s. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jacques, that our present problems are not all the result of the world recession, although the seriousness of that must not be underestimated. To me the important point, and the one I feel many of those in Government of both parties in the '60s and '70s have still not realised, is that during those two decades world markets doubled, and that this unprecedented and enormous growth&#x2014;it was both of these two things, and I think that we shall not see the like of it again&#x2014;alone saved us from massive unemployment many years ago.<lb/>
In 1960 we had almost 20 per cent. of world markets for manufactured goods. By the later 1970s we had between 8 per cent. and 9 per cent., a half-share of a doubled market. The reason that it did not show was this growth. What did show was that country after country, once far below us, soared in this period of unique opportunity to levels of wealth and standards of living double, and even more than double, our own. Sixteen countries now stand above us in the table of GDP per head as a measure of national wealth. We are only just above Portugal and Spain. All this new wealth created in the '60s and '70s passed this nation by. We were blinded, however, because of this huge growth in the total world market. The truth was masked from our people.<lb/>
<col>502</col>
I remember at that time the older factory employees saying to me, "It can't go on like this, can it, Guv'nor?" It did. They said that because the perceptive had noticed the growing flood of foreign motorcars, television sets and other consumer goods into our own market. Those who travelled abroad noticed others were getting richer, but for all that, life was not too bad for us; except in a very brief period in 1976 when our average standard of living dropped for the first time since the war. Your Lordships may remember that that was the year when a young Member of Parliament, as he now is, Richard Page, took the Workington seat, for many years the seat of the noble Lord, Lord Peart, a stronghold for Labour for years and years, with a 22 per cent. swing to the Conservatives.<lb/>
However, that return to reality was short-lived. More money was printed by the then, as it happened, Labour Government&#x2014;and our Governments have been guilty of this in the past, too&#x2014;and the seeds of further inflation were again sown. Although there were many problems, as the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, mentioned, which faced all Governments in those years, it is in my view the fact that they were also, although they did not realise it, aided and saved by this enormous world growth. Their policies through the '60s and '70s, often labelled under the popular title of expansion, did little more than increase inflation and uncompetitiveness, and cause a further loss of market share. Subsidies and the unsustainable levels of public expenditure, for the wealth of the country as it was and is, resulted only in increased taxation which destroyed jobs and initiative; and the area of small business, which has been raised today, in my opinion had the worst results for any country in Europe. The brave steps which have now been taken are beginning to show what the inventiveness of this country can again do in small businesses.<lb/>
One could go on and on talking about the follies of the policies of those years. The same policies today in a static market can only produce total disaster. They were the policies which led to our losing half our markets in less than two decades. I have tried to demonstrate why the public did not react to the Government's peddling of such dangerous policies or potions. In any normal decade, doctors prescribing these cures would have been strung up because the patient would have been nearly dead. Unemployment would have soared, as it finally did in the last years of the Labour Government and has gone on doing ever since.<lb/>
But what of today? Our market share of approximately 9 per cent. is stable&#x2014;if anything, it has grown a little. Overall we are at last proved to be competitive, first by holding a static volume in a static market as we did in 1981 and 1982, with the monthly ups and downs, and now by edging up in a market which is little more than static, which is only fractionally growing. I am aware of figures which suggest that we are less competitive than we were in 1978. They are proven wrong for reasons which I have given. As a one-time Tory Minister of the DOI, I know their base, because I had a large part to play in their introduction in an effort to make my then Secretary of State, Sir Keith Joseph, realise how great our accumulated uncompetitiveness was at that period, and with the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0259"/>
<col>503</col>
exchange rates ruling in 1979 and 1980. At that time in fact I did forecast to him that we would lose between 15 per cent. and 20 per cent. of our manufacturing industry. That is what we did lose. Listening to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, at times he gave one the impression we had lost a much larger chunk of our manufacturing industry. Against our accumulated uncompetitiveness, in a sense it is surprising that we did not lose more.<lb/>
But our industry today is simply not comparable with that of 1978. That is why the comparisons with 1978&#x2014;and I know their base&#x2014;are not in fact valid. Some of the least competitive have gone; the product ranges have all changed. Premiums and not discounts are achieved in home and export markets, where the reverse was the case. We had to sell cheap because of our unreliability and failure to deliver on time and our resulting accumulated reputation. We are now getting premiums across the products of most of the private sector and some of the public. If we were still 20 per cent. uncompetitive, as Shirley Williams suggested on the BBC this morning, we could not have bottomed out and now started to rise; we would still be falling through the floor.<lb/>
In retrospect, I have to admit as a former "wet" that I did not believe, with a pretty long, 30-year, full-time industrial experience behind me, that it was possible to change the attitudes of management and the workforce to increase productivity to new, all-time records, and I hope the Government Minister who replies to this debate will quote the figures of increased productivity which, at a time of static and in many indvidual cases of falling volume, are remarkable to a degree which I think most industrialists would have found incredible a few years ago. Indeed, we have transformed our competitiveness in just a few years in a way that I did not believe was possible.<lb/>
The rough justice&#x2014;and it was rough&#x2014;the cruel and intense pressure on industry, the ghastly growing unemployment, in fact have made us overall competitive in a shorter period; and as to the long-standing ills which the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, recounted so clearly, which are recorded and observed by international and national observers, experts and economists over the years&#x2014;perhaps only in this way could those ills have been put right in such a short time. My old Secretary of State, then Sir Keith Joseph, took much criticism for what he knew was extremely tough medicine but in my belief it has worked and he was broadly right.<lb/>
What we need now is real and steady growth. We do not want excessive or fast growth caused as it would be in a plant, for example, by an undue dose of nitrogen, or the printing of money, which can cause quick growth, no roots and no substance to the stem. That kind of growth can and will wither and will only take us back into the world of uncompetitiveness from which we are just emerging. We can have real, steady growth. Our costs have gone up less than those of other manufacturing countries as a whole in the last few years&#x2014;substantially less. With a little world volume growth and a little increase in shares of the markets our productivity will improve further. Volume growth on a real basis, as any industrialist knows, makes it so much easier in fact to get productivity increases.<lb/>
<col>504</col>
There is no reason why we should lose the increasing momentum now. Of course industrialists, although they have all said that industrial recovery is now coming, are rightly cautious&#x2014;and they must be cautious, as all responsible people are. Above all else, we must keep present attitudes and wage moderation if we are really to get our international competitors on the run; and, my Lords, we can get them on the run for the first time for 30 years. The time for catching up with their living standards&#x2014;and we are far, far behind their living standards&#x2014;must come after, and as a result of, creating new wealth and after we have won back some of our lost years of markets.<lb/>
We are inclined to be cynical and, above all else, to be self-critical in this country after the long years in which we have been progressively left behind by other countries. Other countries, based on success, are openly proud of their industries, yet we still have the brains, the character and the inventions; and we now have the right attitudes on both sides of industry, created in a record short time. We have the attitudes once more to apply our own inventions and skills to our own products rather than watching them being applied to other people's.<lb/>
Nothing now can stop our industrial recovery except gross misunderstanding of the history of the last 25 to 30 years and a return to the kind of medicine which lost us half our markets in less than two decades. High unemployment was caused in the years of fool's paradise in the 1960s and 1970s, under Governments of both parties. Where would unemployment be now if we had dropped not from 20 per cent. of world markets to 8&#x00BD;, but to 12 per cent.?&#x2014;a big enough fall. Our record, which in fact since the world recession started is not so un-comparable with that of European countries anyway, would be far above theirs and our unemployment problem far less. Of course, we would still have problems in the centres of our oldest industries. We can now start to re-create real jobs; and I believe that the policies which have borne the brunt of criticism in a world recession&#x2014;coming at the end of a unique period of growth which hid the truth&#x2014;can rebuild the wealth of this country and, behind it, our standard of living and other desirable things.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01911"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise with some diffidence to follow the economic, industrial and political giants of this House, among whom I number my noble friend Lord Gallacher, who has made a most impressive maiden speech, and I do congratulate him on it. I think we may have had enough statistics for one day. The situation has been described in great detail by a number of speakers and I do not propose to go over all that detail again. We must admit that the 4 million jobs lost since 1966 have not all gone under this Government; but this Government must take the blame for accelerating the process by their blind pursuit of monetarist policies.<lb/>
Ownership and control in industry is in fewer and fewer hands. Decisions of vital importance to workers and the communities in which they live are taken apparently without consultation and apparently without any regard for the local effect. Industry should be efficient, but that aim cannot be divided from the needs of society. It is not efficient to pay more for
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0260"/>
<col>505</col>
people not to work than to work, as the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, has pointed out. The current cost of keeping one unemployed person is of the order of &#x00A3;5,000 per annum when you take into account the loss of tax, the loss of contrubutions and the benefits that have to be paid.<lb/>
When you consider the social cost of unemployment, the amount becomes incalculable. Workers and their families are being tested to destruction by economic pressures, by the tensions that grow between them and by the mounting psychological effects of rejection and boredom. Unemployed teenagers suffer boredom and disillusion, too, but they at least can remember more stable times and can still have hope. If recovery is not too long delayed they may be able to readjust to a better situation; but younger children are having their childhood destroyed by insecurity and, in many cases, hardship. We can never restore those lost years to them and, in terms of damage to their personalities, we are creating a time-bomb for the future that will be very difficult to defuse.<lb/>
In a democracy, governments are elected to manage our resources. They cannot escape that responsibility; nor can they escape the blame for their mistakes and their omissions. There is no shortage of sound advice which could be taken now in order to redeem the present grim situation. Noble Lords who have already spoken, and especially the noble Lord. Lord Ezra, have pointed the way.<lb/>
I wish to emphasise one area which has not received enough attention; that is the creation of worker co-operatives. Co-operatives take many forms but their basic requirements of democratic control and voluntary leadership should appeal to all political creeds in this country. The degree of job satisfaction enjoyed by workers in co-operatives is high and the days when such organisations were either failed enterprises or trendy alternative lifestyles are being left behind, although there will always be some of those on the co-operative scene.<lb/>
The role of the Co-operative Development Agency is crucial to the further development of the co-operative sector, and it is essential that it should be well organised and sensibly funded. The present Co-operative Development Agency has performed miracles on a very low budget. There should be strong support for the formation of more local agencies to offer advice and information, and local authorities should be encouraged to take positive steps to make premises available.<lb/>
The Co-operative Party has recently commissioned a report on co-operative opportunity. I commend it to the next government, whoever they may be. They will have a mammoth task to revive our shattered industrial base and co-operatives are a valuable aid to that end. We need a whole new approach to the problem of unemployment. Workers' resistance to change and to new technology can be overcome if they can see that the benefits will be shared with them and not simply added to the profits of the few while more and more of the workers join the dole queue. In the end, there is no permanent way to industrial peace and prosperity except by understanding and co-operation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01916">5.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01917">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01918"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I first apologise to the House, and to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and my noble friend Lord Gallacher, as, for the last seconds of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and the first few seconds of the speech of my noble friend Lord Gallacher, I was seized with a discomfiture which compelled me to leave the Chamber.<lb/>
There is one thing about this Chamber, which is that, whatever the debate may be, one can only be impressed by some of the contributions and one can learn so much from them. I remember that in one of the post-Falklands debates I was not only deeply interested in the contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, but so much compelled to read the report of his speech in the quiet hours and to inform myself of much that I did not know. There are a number of things which I hoped would happen in this debate today, but, alas, up to now, apart from my noble friend's contribution, there has not been a great deal and there has not been much information from those with vast experience who might have taught us something. The reason for that, I suppose, is the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0261"/>
<col>507</col>
impending general election when all that we are parading&#x2014;and I shall be as guilty as anyone&#x2014;is our loyalty to our parties.<lb/>
What I find amazing about some of the speeches from the Benches opposite are all the reasons why this country is in one of the most disastrous situations that it has been in since the end of the First World War. From the Benches opposite, these reasons have been listed&#x2014;the world situation, the change in world economics, bad management, irresponsible trade unions and everything, except the fact that the real cause is the Conservative Government, which has the major responsibility.<lb/>
I am bound to say&#x2014;if I were a really unfeeling person I would not say it&#x2014;that, despite the Gallup polls, this is one of the biggest laughs going on in the country. It is a joke in the clubs, it is a joke in the pubs, it is a joke among rugby players and it is a joke among soccer players. Blame everybody except yourself, as Mrs. Thatcher's Government do. We have had an example <i>par excellence</i> of that today.<lb/>
This would not be so had if it were not so serious, because the Government are not even prepared to learn. The nation must understand quite clearly that the same bilious medicine that has caused so much disaster will be continued should the supreme disaster take place and the party opposite be returned to power. That will indeed be a black day for this country, and the country ought to note it, because we shall have the same policies which have caused this terrible problem.<lb/>
Those of us who are just about young enough to remember the 'thirties can recall what happened then and can make a comparison. The comparison is this. The myopic attitude of Conservative Governments has always been to cross the river to fill the pail&#x2014;and the journey there and the journey back can be risky and disastrous&#x2014;when it can be filled on the side that we are on.<lb/>
I listened to the remarkable speech by the noble Lord. Lord Thorneycroft. I remember listening to him when I was a very young councillor on Fulham Borough Council, and I used to think that one of the great assets of the Tory Party was that they seemed to have so many men of ability who could also put over a case. Perhaps the greatest ability of the Tory politicians of those days was the manner in which they put over a case, which enticed innocent people to think that they actually believed some of the things they were saying.<lb/>
We had an example of it afterwards in the one famous Prime Minister with whom I think the noble Lord Lord Thorneycroft, had an occasional brush&#x2014;Mr. Harold Macmillan. He "conned" the country. We all remember the phrase, and we are getting it today. The Tory Party has the audacity today to say what he said then and which won him his election&#x2014;"You've never had it so good". But the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, told us a moment ago that that was the time when we started to behave in an appalling manner under Tory and Labour Governments. Yet there was the Prime Minister of the day telling us that we had never had it so good.</membercontribution></p>
<col>508</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01919"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what I said to the House was that our standard of living was not only maintained but improved, in spite of losing half our share of a doubled market.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01920"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is precisely what has been happening in the last three or four years, and I must acknowledge the courage of the noble Viscount to have said it. But we cannot swing it all the way back and say that the men who returned to this country in 1945, under the leadership of a Labour Government, who started to build the welfare state which became the envy of the world, who started to create the principle of full employment, who introduced a new deal on education and who introduced the National Health Service, within a few years of the most disastrous war in the history of mankind, did not do so well. I do not think that that is either a decent or an honest argument.<lb/>
However, as the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, said, perhaps one of the reasons for our demise in the past few years is that we have not matched our rivals. There is a great deal of truth in that. When one looks at the hard statistics and facts, this country has not done so very well in the past three or four years, and therefore the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, was correct to say that we have not matched our rivals. One must then ask: why? The shortest possible answer is that it is because of the present Government's dreadful policies over the past few years.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, also adumbrated the possibility, in defence of his party, for which I do not blame him, that when we have a Labour Government they may interfere with GATT. As the noble Lord honestly explained, the idea of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was not very popular with the Government of which he was a member. However, as happens in all parties, the noble Lord was able to convince sufficient of his fellow Conservatives about the intelligent and sensible ideals which lie behind the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It was a massive move forward for the Tory Party to acknowledge that they must discard, totally and absolutely, unfettered competition in return for sensible world co-operation. The noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, mentioned that imperial preference was at the time the high ideal of high Toryism. I am grateful that the noble Lord won the day. It seems that always we have to drag the Tory Party kicking and screaming into the next decade.<lb/>
The noble Lord also quoted Winston Churchill, who said in the 1930s that if we went on as we were, half the nation would leave this country. Under the Tory Government of the 1930s, tens of thousands of our fellow countrymen found no hope in the policies of the then Tory Government. Those policies were very mild compared with what our fellow countrymen have to put up with today&#x2014;4 million on the dole as a result of the past four years of the current Tory Administration.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, pointed out the horror of the possibility of this country leaving the Common Market. Only a fortnight ago the Prime Minister was praised for having improved the rotten deal we are getting from Europe. She has said that she will fight as hard as possible for an even better deal if we stay in Europe. We cannot praise the Prime
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0262"/>
<col>509</col>
Minister for having fought for a better deal in the Common Market and then say a couple of minutes later that the best thing that ever happened to us was to join the Common Market. That is another quite remarkable statement.<lb/>
I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, is no longer in the Chamber, for I wish to turn next to the excellent speech which he made. It was marred only by one remarkable statement. The noble Lord praised the Government for aiding the small businessman. The fact is that ever since records have been kept there has never been such a high level of bankruptcies among small businessmen as we have witnessed during the past two years. The Government need to give small businessmen a hand. I have mentioned many times in this House that the small businessman is vital to this country&#x2014;also that when we refer to people who are on the dole we have to remember that during the past four years thousands of small businesses have gone down the Tory drain, causing anguish and anger. If they have any sense, the Tory Party will never take that risk again.<lb/>
I was interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, mention the current campaign, which the Government have just thought of, imploring everyone to buy British. I agree with both the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and the Government that to buy British is a very good aim. However, I wish that the Prime Minister believed in it so far as the shipbuilding industry is concerned. We all know where the last big order went. It did not go to a British shipyard. There was no "Buy British" for the Prime Minister. Off that order went to Malta. These are the unchallengeable facts which the British people have got to appreciate.<lb/>
It is right and proper to speak about the need for publicly owned industries to buy British. At the same time we have to appreciate that there are many hundreds of private firms which service the publicly owned industries; whether defence, the National Coal Board, the Central Electricity Generating Board, the British Gas Corporation, and also local government. They provide roads, lamps, traffic signals&#x2014;all for the wickedly publicly owned sector. We ought to acknowledge not only that the publicly owned sector makes a massive contribution to the nation but that it provides a great deal of work for private entrepreneurs. Noble Lords who appreciate both sides of this massive co-operation and who do not listen too much to the glib nastiness of some of the Tory popular press know that very often the massive public corporations are the lifeblood of a myriad of small private enterprises. Therefore, it is important for British, publicly-owned industries at all times to endeavour to ensure that the private sector also purchases from Great Britain.<lb/>
I listened with great interest to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross. I have already mentioned the few facts which he omitted about the economy of this country when our ex-servicemen came back here in 1945. By 1955 they had helped to create, under Governments of both parties, the largest housing programme that this country had ever seen. We all remember Mr. Harold Macmillan's 300,000 houses. He did not build them, but he had the idea. We have to recognise the contribution made by the
<col>510</col>
bricklayers, the carpenters, the quantity surveyors. But the challenge was the record of the previous 40 years. It was dismal. Then it was raised to its highest level by Aneurin Bevan. That presented a challenge to the Conservative Party.<lb/>
I am all for competition which is related to getting the best National Health Service, the best social security, the best education, the best housing programme. This is thoroughly satisfactory, and in a modern industrial society these are the beatitudes which we must not lose sight of in our industrial endeavour. To keep blaming one another is not good enough. The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, reminded me of the tens of thousands of people we see on the tanner banks at every soccer game. We find brilliant centre forwards by the tens of thousands, brilliant goalkeepers, brilliant strikers and brilliant halfbacks, all on the tanner bank. And some of them are on the Cross-Benches of this House.<lb/>
There are many more points which I should like to make, but if I did so I do not suppose I would convert any noble Lord. Nevertheless, if we want something which will get us out of a mess we should look for some principle and policy that has succeeded. When there was a certain situation in the Western world in the 1930s, I happen to believe that it was the policies of Keynes and Galbraith with which Franklin D. Roosevelt created the New Deal that pulled America out of the soup and then pulled us out of the soup. It not only created a better industrial base, but permitted us to be in a better position to take out the unwholesomeness of European fascism. There is a need for intelligent co-operation on all sides of industry. I do not believe it helps for the TUC and the CBI to be at each other's throats all the time when there is a need for sensible collaboration.<lb/>
I believe that we can restore a caring society, and a caring society is something that we must all accept as a fundamental belief. It is not industrial success by itself that matters, but what we do with that succes that will uplift our nation. This nation can show the way to a very disturbed world. When one looks at all the various theories of economics and "isms" which are abundant, one has to make a choice. In my lifetime, I have seen it proved beyond all peradventure&#x2014;and I hope that the British people will see this as well in the weeks ahead&#x2014;that the best system of all for giving a fair deal and a fair break is that which is embraced in the principles of democratic socialism.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01921"><member>Lord Rochester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, sits down, will he accept that when my noble friend Lord Ezra advocated, as he did, a policy of controlled expenditure on our infrastructure, and said that wherever possible purchasing should be achieved through British suppliers, he also made it very plain that this should in no sense be done at the expense of British competitiveness?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01922"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that is correct. I only grieve, having listened to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, that he did not stay to listen to mine.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0442P0I0263"/>
<col>511</col>
first, because of the lucid and moving defence made by my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft of the principles of free trade. They will also remember it for the invigorating and very encouraging estimate of the future of our country given by my noble friend Lord Trenchard, and I suspect also for the characteristically brilliant picture given by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, of what I believe he would refer to as the "locust years". I was also impressed by the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, and her interesting speculations on the possibilities of co-operatives playing a part in our national recovery in the future. Like other noble Lords, I should also like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, on his powerful and balanced maiden speech.<lb/>
Those of us who heard the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, when he introduced this debate will also remember his speech for the fact that he recognised&#x2014;late, I thought, and a little grudgingly&#x2014;that one of this Government's achievements was the control or conquest of inflation. I believe that the noble Lord, on thinking back, will acknowledge that his recognition was a little grudging, recalling the fact that many years ago, during the course of the "locust years", one of the leaders of his party made a firm statement about how important it was that the pound in one's pocket one week had the same value as the pound in one's pocket shortly after. I hope also that the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, will find that the remarks that I have to make about a country bordering on the North Atlantic are as enlightened as those he heard me make about a country bordering on the South Atlantic.<lb/>
The world is undergoing a recession, largely but not entirely inspired by two major increases in oil prices. It is also going through a major transformation in technology. The chief mark of this transformation is surely a change towards high technology and electronics. These changes&#x2014;the consequences of which will be enormous in the next 20 years&#x2014;have been compared by some with the changes caused in the world by the Industrial Revolution. It is doubtful whether the changes will be anything like as significant as that, but one can say that the consequences will come faster, and that the 20 years between 1980 and the year 2000 will see far more changes than those seen between 1780 and the year 1800.<lb/>
Nevertheless, recollection of what happened in the late 18th century is quite valuable for our purposes, for this reason: the changes at that time due to mechanisation were vigorously resisted by those whom history has come to refer to as the Luddites&#x2014;yet the fact is, as historians testify, that the numbers employed increased steadily despite the machinery that was introduced and despite the very large increase in the population in all the countries which were experiencing the effect of mechanisation for the first time. That may be a helpful reminder to those who wonder about the consequences of automation or advanced mechanisation at the present time.<lb/>
With all these changes&#x2014;and the Industrial Revolution was no exception to this&#x2014;some nations are left behind because of the consequences of the transformation. China was a very good example in the 18th century. To some of us it certainly appeared a
<col>512</col>
possibility in the 1970s that Britain might have been just such a country. All the signs of decay were present. It seems to me that 1979 gave this country a chance of renewal and of adjustment to the changes that were necessary. I myself hope that that chance will be confirmed in 1983.<lb/>
We heard from my noble friend Lord Trenchard some indications of increased international competitiveness and of increasingly encouraging signs from the economy. Some of the points he mentioned were certainly very impressive. Another figure that might interest your Lordships is the clear sign that in the past year or two&#x2014;particularly in 1982&#x2014;there has been in this country a substantial increase in productivity per man hour, second to none among OECD countries. In some months there was an increase in productivity higher than that of Japan. The question must be; can that increase in productivity be consolidated? And can the consequent benefits reinvigorate the entire economy and bring back into the active economy the 3 million unemployed? This is the main question we should be considering when preparing our minds for the general election.<lb/>
I must just remind your Lordships that the picture of unemployment that has been given was interestingly corrected by my noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing when he pointed out that alongside the increase in jobs lost there has nevertheless been, over the past 12 months, a substantial increase in the number of new businesses. The figure he gave was 10,000 new businesses a month.<lb/>
To return to the main theme of my speech, can we encourage or invigorate the economy so that the beneficial developments which are occurring in the advanced companies can affect the entire nation? There are two ways in which this can be done: first, by a tactical approach, and, secondly, by a strategic approach. The tactical approach is not one, I would suggest, which is the same as that put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra. We have to think carefully about this&#x2014;I quote from the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher&#x2014;"sympathetic economic environment" in which small companies, indeed large companies if the small companies become such, can really thrive. That is what Sir Keith Joseph has referred to on many occasions as a climate of enterprise.<lb/>
What is a climate of enterprise? There are many things which you would expect to find, and among them, it seems to me, are these. I do not put these in any particular order of priority. First of all, the chance of profit, the promise of prosperity if things do go well, and indeed, the chance of establishing yourself as a person of independent means. Surely that is a great contribution to society and to the climate of enterprise to which the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, referred.<lb/>
Secondly, companies should not be expected in the future to spend the kind of time they have had to spend, not so much in the recent past but in the 1970s and 1960s, in dealing with unproductive problems of labour. There are endless instances in the 1970s of companies whose executives spent something like 50 per cent., or even more, of their time dealing with labour disputes which had nothing to do with production. Another point to try to insist upon is that the shop floor must cease to be a place for class war, or class conflict. Of course, conflict, and competition,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0264"/>
<col>513</col>
must play a part in all kinds of enterprise; I perfectly agree with that. But let the competition and the conflict be directed towards industrial or possibly international competitors.<lb/>
Thirdly&#x2014;and here the Government can play a part&#x2014;everything should be done to make job mobility and, indeed, housing mobility, easier, and some of the measures introduced by the Government in the last four years have certainly helped in both directions. I think that a climate of enterprise must have&#x2014;I say this in particular reference to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn&#x2014;if not a zero rate of inflation, which perhaps in current circumstances is a dream, but at the very least a reasonable predictability in relation to their money. This is something which affects the fabric of society, it seems to me, just as much as employment. Simplification of tax is also extremely desirable. A day perhaps will come when companies will think once again, if they are taking on an extra director, whether he should be an accountant or somebody interested in the promotion of the product concerned, which certainly used to be the case in the past. Finally, of course, the climate of enterprise depends on that membership of an open trading international community, both through GATT and the European Community, to which the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, referred with such eloquence.<lb/>
This certainly is not the managed economy to which the noble Lord, Lord Jacques, referred as having been so successful in the years after the war. I would not say that everything done in the years immediately after the war should be rejected; of course, that would be absurd. But I think it is important to say, in relation to the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Jacques, that in addition to the things of which he approves, those things to which the noble Lord, Lord Harris, referred are also important to recall; an era of the beginning of the British disease, of numerous restrictive practices, of decline of investment, of our declining share, as the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, put it, of the doubled world market, as it was; an era of increased imports; and, I should add a contribution of my own in this respect, an era in which there was a steady decline, it seemed to me, in the belief in the dignity of work itself. That is the tactical approach which I suggest is desirable to try to create this beneficial climate which the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, demanded.<lb/>
But there is a long-term approach, in which no doubt the Government and other sources of influence and communication can play a part. Not long ago I sat next to a Cambridge don in that university who told me that he had analysed the career records of his 500 pupils over the last 25 years. It must be said that he taught history. He discovered that out of those 500 pupils he could only find for certain that two had gone into business. This seems to me to be an indication of some of the prejudices which still continue in the nation against the idea of commercial activity. It anyone thinks this is a new development. I should refer him to a speech made some 70 years ago by the second Earl of Selborne, in which he said:
<quote>"When I was at Oxford the best brains at Oxford when they had a chance went into the Indian Civil Service. It was only the second best as a rule who went"&#x2014;</quote>
<col>514</col>
not to industry&#x2014;
<quote>"to the Home Civil Service".</quote>
He added:
<quote>"The best men are all prepared to take the least risks".</quote>
I think, perhaps, it was to this defect in the appreciation of enterprise, to which my noble friend Lord Thorneycroft referred, not in his speech this evening but in a speech he made I think two years ago, when he pointed out that most people who have played a part in public life in the last 50 years had something to answer for. I think the main point is our attitude to enterprise and to business as such.<lb/>
A very important point, which must occur to an historian working on this kind of theme, is that we have also become used over the last generation to a persistent neglect of the virtues of those who carried out the Industrial Revolution in the first place. It is very surprising that until the recent establishment of the admirable museum at Ironbridge, there was no museum in this country dedicated to those great men who started off the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. I cannot help feeling, as an historian, that the recollection of the vigour of the past, communicated through schools, through the media, perhaps, dare I say, through the Churches, may be the best pointer to revival in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01926"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to open by giving a very brief summary of the economic achievements of an administration going to the country after four years in power; an administration in which real wages remained constant, in which employment&#x2014;not unemployment&#x2014;increased by 15 per cent., in which real gross national product increased by 20 per cent., in which labour productivity increased by 4 per cent.&#x2014;all, I think your Lordships would agree, good measures of successful economic management of an economy over a period of four years.<lb/>
Now I should like to give another example of an administration going to the country after four years in office; unemployment increased by 2 million, a record only worsened, as my noble friend Lord Cledwyn said, by Spain; production of wealth declined by 4 per cent. and with manufacturing production declining by 11 per cent. when the average for an industrialised country as a whole was only 3 per cent. Manufacturing investment&#x2014;and this comes back to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra&#x2014;declined by 36 per cent. For the first time in the history of the country concerned, manufacturing imports exceeded manufacturing exports and manufacturing exports declined in absolute terms by 3 per cent. over the period.<lb/>
It will be no secret which is the second country to which I am referring, with a disastrous economic record. It is, of course, this country and the disastrous economic record of the present Government. The other country to which I referred, which I think your Lordships will agree has had a successful economic record, was not a monetarist Government. It was the administration of President Jimmy Carter, after the oil crisis to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, referred. Everyone seems to think that
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0265"/>
<col>515</col>
that was a disaster which fell on all industrialised economies equally, and that that somehow excused the policies of the present Government, when the fact of the matter is that if any country had any chance whatever of gaining from the increase in the real price of oil it was the country which is a net exporter of oil compared with many of its industrial competitors who have done so much better over this period.<lb/>
There can be no doubt at this stage of the debate about the economic facts of the past four years and, in particular, the facts of industrial production. If there were any doubts about it, those doubts are silenced by the attempts that the Government have made to cover up the economic position of this country. Last month, the National Economic Development Council published a rather gloomy report, in which it said there would be no increase in employment; not this year, not next year, but by the end of the decade. It pointed out that there was more difficulty in the United Kingdom than in other countries in establishing credibility for investment projects, particularly in manufacturing industry. It talked about the job losses in this country; not just in manufacturing industry as a whole. Several noble Lords referred to what I suppose is the inevitable decline in jobs in some of the old staple industries&#x2014;the extracting industries, and so on&#x2014;but there has been a job loss in the electronics industry in this country. This must be the only country in the Western world capable of achieving a job loss in the electronics industry. If we have an economy in which we are spending, or losing, &#x00A3;17 billion a year on benefits and lost taxes&#x2014;&#x00A3;100 a week for every person unemployed&#x2014;how in those circumstances can it be claimed that there is an economic defence to be made for the policies of the present Government?<lb/>
That report was published by the National Economic Development Council in April of this year. It followed an earlier report made to the National Economic Development Council which was greeted by the members of the council at a meeting, the minutes of which have been leaked but which have never properly been made public. This report was very much worse, but was suppressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and by the CBI members of the National Economic Development Council. I challenge the Government, and the Minister in his reply, to deny that there was a report which was very much gloomier than the one I quoted and which has been suppressed.<lb/>
If there was any doubt concerning the prognostications of improved economic conditions which several noble Lords have made, that doubt has been destroyed this week. There is no conceivable rational argument for the Government to go to the country now if they really believe that there is to be a significant economic improvement between now and the time when their natural term of office expires a year from now.<lb/>
It is not enough, as several noble Lords have said, to attack the present Government. We have to think of what to do about the position. I profoundly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, that the real issue is that of industrial investment. Indeed, I referred to it earlier and I believe that his analysis of the situation is sound, but I believe it deserves a little further exploration. The issue is not that there are not enough funds available for investment in total. There are considerable funds
<col>516</col>
available. Indeed, some City observers have described funds as "washing around the economy".<lb/>
The problem is both negative and positive. The negative side is that there are much quicker profits to be gained from non-productive, non-manufacturing activities in this country such as finance and property and, of course, from the export of investment capital. I am not one of those who say that there should be no export of investment capital. We are a trading nation, as the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, said, and long may we remain so. Incidentally, I thought that was a brilliant attack on protectionism which is not the policy of the Labour Party. We are a trading nation and, being so, that implies some freedom in the movement of capital. That is not to say that for all time all investment overseas is the wrong policy to pursue. But there are times when it has gone to excess and I believe that the last four years, since the scrapping of exchange controls, is one of those periods when it has been positively damaging to the manufacturing industry in this country.<lb/>
The positive reason is, as several noble Lords have said, that there is not the climate in which people have any confidence to start off in private manufacturing industry. They are given no encouragement by any management whatsoever of Government expenditure. Here we come to one of those areas where dogma has taken the place of realism in Government policy. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, referred to the need for investment in the infrastructure; what he called the fabric of our industrial society. He is right. To talk about the construction industry and the renewal of the fabric of our utilities is the right approach. I do not believe that anyone looking at it objectively could disagree with that argument. The problem is that the Conservative Party does not look at it objectively. The Conservative Party says that these elements of expenditure are necessarily public expenditure, that they affect the public sector borrowing requirement and, therefore, they are not acceptable and anathema to the believers in the pure market economy. Therefore, they reject by far the most readily available means of reviving industrial manufacturing production without any inflationary effects. There is no proven relationship between the size of the public sector borrowing requirement and inflation. If the noble Lord the Minister has evidence to the contrary, I shall be delighted to hear it.<lb/>
So we have the position where an obvious starting point for industrial regeneration is rejected for dogmatic reasons by the Conservative Party. That is by far the most important single element in the policies we shall be pursuing. I am certainly not going to claim to expound Labour Party policy about industrial production. My noble friends, particularly my noble friend Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, are far more qualified to do that than I am. But I would add to what I have said, and to what other noble Lords have said, one particular point which I believe to be of considerable importance and which I think should be considered by all parties and not on a party political basis. Reference has been made to the problems of unimaginative management. The noble Lord, Lord Harris of High Cross, made that reference, although I think he was unfortunate in choosing the example of Bill Allen in seeking to attack the trade unions. Bill
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0266"/>
<col>517</col>
Allen showed that by imaginative co-operation with the trade unions one can make successful progress.<lb/>
There is one matter which is capable of legislative correction which could make industrial management in this country enormously more effective. I refer to the transferability of pensions. I believe that the risks for managers when changing jobs in mid-career are great because, to be frank, of the fraud which is practised upon them by the pensions system of receiving frozen pensions which cannot be transferred. Those risks actually deter innovation and enterprise in managers who have something to contribute from breaking out of a unitary career and doing something new for the benefit of themselves and of society.<lb/>
I believe that it should be a priority of any Government elected on 9th June to remedy that serious drawback and problem from which managers in the private sector suffer. I am talking about the private sector of course; in the public sector there is either a lifetime career or transferability. I hope on that suitably non-controversial note I can conclude by saying that I support the Motion moved by my noble friend Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01927">6.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01928"><member>Lord Granville of Eye</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like briefly to add to the tributes paid to the Leader of the Opposition. The noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, made a very able speech in introducing the Motion and drawing attention to the record of industrial production and growth. Most of the speeches have referred to that. It has certainly had the attention which the Motion requested. I also much enjoyed listening to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, who I thought made a very eloquent appeal, which I have no doubt will be listened to outside as well as in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
But so far in the various speeches that have been made referring to the Government and the Opposition no noble Lord has mentioned what might happen if by any chance we get a hung Parliament. While listening to the debate and the various policies put forward, it seemed to me that it has all happened before. In 1931, we had a hung Parliament. The Prime Minister was Mr. Ramsay MacDonald and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was Mr. Philip Snowden. The Liberals had 59 seats and Labour had the largest party. The Liberal Party, under Mr. Lloyd George's aegis, spent a great deal of time, money and research on a policy which they called "We can conquer unemployment". It was very much concerned with some of the capital works which I think I recognise in the present policy of the Labour Party. What happened to it? Both Mr. Philip Snowden and the Prime Minister, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, turned it down. I think it was the late Sir Dingle Foot who said it was turned down basically by Whitehall and the Treasury officials, who said that until the economy was put onto a sound footing&#x2014;after Margaret Bondfield's 3 million unemployed&#x2014;it would be wrong to go for large-scale capital investment and capital works.<lb/>
The parallel with 1931, with 3 million unemployed and the world economic crisis, was referred to by Lord Thorneycroft. We had a great conference on it at the
<col>518</col>
Imperial Museum, of 66 nations, including America and most of the other producing countries. When all the policies had been produced, the research had been done and all the exchanges with President Roosevelt had taken place, it all came down to one word, "confidence", which really began the revival of 1931&#2013;32. The only public works that I can remember that we had in those days was the rearmament programme of Mr. Baldwin, which was worth about &#x00A3;1,500 million. But it seems to me that unless we, as an international trading nation, can get that confidence across to the people abroad who will buy our goods, the investors&#x2014;as has been said in so many speeches this afternoon&#x2014;and the IMF, we shall not get very far.<lb/>
Reference has been made to subsidising capital works. At the moment we are subsidising the railways, the mines, British Leyland, steel, shipbuilding, and so on. At the end of the road, when you start spending money, is the IMF. I think it was Mr. Healey who had to get off the plane at Heathrow and come back because the IMF had said, "Stop". If you are an international trading nation in our position, at the end of this is the IMF. You either belong to it or you do not, though of course we could become an artisan island in the North Sea, with the lowest standard of living in Europe, build a wall around ourselves and say we are not concerned with international trade.<lb/>
At this late hour, I should like briefly to refer to two points. One is the adverse balance of manufactured goods with the EEC. I wonder whether the Minister can give us any idea of the current figure? My recollection is that the adverse balance in manufactured goods with continental countries in the EEC is still a very large item. I think we really must do something about that. Of course we gave them an 11-month start before we went in. They had established their organisations, built up their distributive arrangements and got right into our markets. If you go into the shops of most large towns, you can still see Italian, German and French goods of all kinds.<lb/>
Today it is entirely a question of whether we are competitive. A man who is running a group of stores or a shop within the Economic Community will buy the goods that are the best value. If we are not producing the goods, we are wasting our breath. We are wasting our breath with all the diatribes we can conceive unless we are competitive in selling our goods. In the so-called wages explosion of 1975&#2013;76, I remember attending a costing meeting in a large factory. They were asking for a 16 per cent. increase in labour costs because of inflation. The 16 per cent. plus had to go on the cost. The result was that they lost orders and within a few months there were 90 redundancies.<lb/>
Reference was made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, to some kind of new arrangement in industry if we are to get into a competitive position so that we can restore full employment, such as workers mounting co-operatives, and so on. But we must be frank about this. The industrial climate is very important. We have industrial confrontation and two armies&#x2014;unions and management&#x2014;fighting with zeal an interminable battle resulting in all these strikes.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0267"/>
<col>519</col>
One other matter has been referred to&#x2014;the discouragement of middle management. I am not concerned with top management on the top salaries. It is middle management which is vital to the great industries of this country. They will not try any more if they are discouraged by taxation&#x2014;if there is talk about making the pips squeak.<lb/>
The other issue is the home market. Can any of your Lordships tell me why it is if you go into certain streets all you can see are foreign, and especially Japanese, cars? In this respect I understand that there is a proportion of 70 or 80 per cent. of cars are in the car fleets of commercial companies. These companies employ British workpeople, and they have to sell their goods. Do they buy British cars?<lb/>
We are faced with another problem, which has been referred to several times; that of the microchip revolution. No party&#x2014;not the Government, not the Opposition&#x2014;has faced up to the problem of the vacuum which will result when the microchip, or electronic innovation, really becomes established in the great industries of this country.<lb/>
Reference has been made to two nations, the North and the South. There will be two nations. There will be those who work in the factories, in the electronic microchip plants, producing goods for home consumption and for export. And the others? Who will employ them? Will they have to take in one another's washing, or engage in home trades? Or are we going to recognise the fact that we may be more than half way towards the age of leisure? We must realise that it is no good describing the situation as "overmanning". There are large numbers of people who go through the motions; they clock in, they clock out. It is not work; it is not like a machine shop; it is an occupation. We have had an interesting debate. It was certainly worthwhile the Opposition introducing it, but of course the answer will be found at the hustings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01929">6.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01930"><member>Lord Scanlon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I suggest that this debate might prove to be something of an exercise in futility, in that if there is a change of Government, any remarks which I may make in replying this evening to our excellent discussion will prove to have been unnecessary, while if there is not a change of Government, my remarks will in the future be ignored with the same kind of zeal with which they have been ignored in the past. To that extent the debate can, I repeat, be seen as an exercise in futility. My noble friend Lord Gallacher, whom I must compliment on an excellent maiden speech, served a dual purpose in that, besides addressing the House, he, no doubt much to the delight of your Lordships, eliminated at least two pages of the notes which I had prepared for this reply.<lb/>
In opening the debate, my noble friend Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos suggested that there was common ground between us, on the basis that, if we are to survive as an industrial nation, we all not only desire, but must have, an economic, viable manufacturing base. I believe that that has been the central theme throughout the debate. We had an excellent contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, in which he gave his version of the manufacturing
<col>520</col>
base, but I hope that I shall be forgiven for saying that I thought that it had little to do with the issue. I hope that perhaps there will be a future occasion on which we can debate the question of the Common Market. All I would say at this stage is that in or out of the Common Market, nobody is going to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for Britain. We will succeed by pulling ourselves up by our own bootlaces, or we will not succeed at all, either in or out of the Common Market.<lb/>
What I believe is irrefutable is the fact that in the four years from January 1979 to January 1983 total national output&#x2014;that is, the gross domestic product&#x2014;fell by nearly 7 per cent. That is devastating in its own right. But if one looks at certain sections of our manufacturing base, one sees that the situation is truly horrific. There has been a 35 per cent. fall in ferrous metal production, a 31 per cent. fall in textiles, and a 29 per cent. fall in metal goods. Even in the so-called success sectors, which have increased output, the position has to be seen in perspective. A 2 per cent. increase in three years in the electrical and electronic sector is in fact a dismal record, given the opportunities we have had, given the extension of credit for consumer durables, <i>et cetera.</i> It is a dismal record, hearing in mind that it is meant to be one of the industries for the future.<lb/>
Much has been said about productivity by most of your Lordships who have spoken in the debate. The point has been made&#x2014;and I think we all agree&#x2014;that British industry is now leaner. Is it fitter? That is the real question which has been asked. Again, the noble Lord, Lord Thorneycroft, had no difficulty or compunction in finding an affirmative answer to the question. But let us look at it in a little more depth. It is true that in manufacturing industry productivity is today slightly higher than it was in 1979. But there has been no productivity miracle. Yes, there was a steep rise in productivity in 1981, but it had been preceded by a very steep fall in 1980. Averaging out those figures, one sees that there has been no major increase in the long run in the growth rate of productivity.<lb/>
I say to your Lordships in all seriousness that when one looks at the major factors contributing to productivity and tries to foresee the future, one finds that the outlook appears very grim indeed. I have no hesitation at all in referring to one of the major factors&#x2014;that of investment. In manufacturing industry we are 33 per cent. below the investment level of 1979. That is bad enough. But then we have the noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, saying why this is so. I want to put to the noble Viscount an alternative reason which I think is truer historically, and which goes back even farther than the reasons which he advanced. With a secure home market, bolstered by the possession of an Empire which provided not only the source of very cheap raw materials, but also a market for much of our manufactured goods, we did little, if anything, by way if investment for the future. That lack of investment in the past has now resulted in low returns; and low returns now in the maufacturing industry is the reason why we are not getting the investment today&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01931"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that the noble Lord will allow me to say that I entirely accept
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0268"/>
<col>521</col>
that the imperial preference situation, which favoured us for a long while, was certainly one of the major problems which the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, would rightly have said faced all post-war Governments. Undoubtedly, we had been living on that situation. But it does not alter the fact that we lost half of our markets in two decades, and that did not then show. It has shown only in recent times when world growth stopped.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01932"><member>Lord Scanlon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I fully agree. But what has not been explained is why we lost those markets. I know that it is easy to blame restrictive practices on the trade unions, and so on. The real truth, I suggest, is that the lack of investment in the past still continues which means that our technological advance is way behind that of our industrial competitors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01933"><member>Lord George-Brown</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am reluctant to interrupt my colleague, but he is glossing over an important point. I think that he should face it honestly for the sake of himself as well as the House. When, in 1965 and 1966, we attached ourselves to investment in the future, he led a union, if I may say so with great respect, that was insistent upon retaining restrictive practices. As near as damn it, that was what lost us our markets. We can all change our minds. We can all grow up. We can all be different. I think, however, with great respect, that the noble Lord should perhaps simply say, "I did play a pretty lousy part at that time".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01934"><member>Lord Scanlon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord George-Brown, pre-empts me. I have never tried to argue that the trade union movement is somehow all clean on this issue and that it has not had restrictive practices. My argument relates to the major cause of the ineptness&#x2014;I do not hesitate to use the word&#x2014;of manufacturing industry in Britain.<lb/>
If we must go back to other factors, I invite the House to consider the contributions that I have mentioned in your Lordships' House before. British industry in the 1970s had a deal that no other industry or Government has had in peacetime. I refer to the three periods of wage restraint when the people of these islands accepted wage reductions well below the level of inflation which contributed to bringing down inflation from 26 per cent. to single figures, but did not result in investment in British industry. This means that &#x00A3;10 billion in direct money and in portfolios goes towards investment in factories and shares abroad when it should be invested here. I repeat that I do not think that one can rely upon patriotism or voluntarism on the issue of investment. We had the National Enterprise Board to find the money if private capital was not available.<lb/>
I should like to continue to deal with the other factors that give cause for alarm. There has been mention of the training of professional engineers, technicians and craftsmen who will come on stream in four years' time. I have a horrible feeling that we shall be short of these people in the future as we have been short of them in the past, due to short-sightedness in the training programme. In 1979, the total number of apprentice technicians and craftsmen was 100,000.
<col>522</col>
Today, the figure is 40,000. In engineering, there were 27,000 apprentice craftsmen and technicians in 1979. Today, the figure is just below 9,000.<lb/>
When it comes to research and development, the position is even more black. The recession itself is causing firms to cut back on this vital investment in the future. This affects not only basic research but also applied research and development. There is some hope. I must pay tribute, yes, to this Government. This non-interventionist Government have at last seen the light and have agreed upon the Alvey plan, under which they will invest &#x00A3;200 million in the future of communication technology and computers. That is very welcome, and all I can say is that it is long overdue.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have the opportunity of debating your own Select Committee report on research and development sometime in July. I shall say no more about investment in research and development until that time. What is important is that productivity is not an end in itself. Nor is productivity the only aspect. It is production and productivity, not one or the other. Seen in that light, the real answer is that productivity has gone up because employment has fallen faster than output has fallen. I can perhaps use a cricketing metaphor. We may have improved the batting average of UK Limited but only by not sending in the last six batsmen. Cricket matches are won by the number of runs scored, not by the batting averages of those lucky enough to participate in the batting.<lb/>
The key question must be; What will happen if and when&#x2014;I have to say "if and when" and not that it will take place&#x2014;the economy picks up? It is not difficult to keep down inflation with 3 or 4 million unemployed. If this is to be the pattern of the Government for the future, we know where we stand. But there has been no dramatic improvement in industrial relations. It is true that militancy has diminished. It would be surprising if that was not so with nearly 4 million unemployed. Is it, however, not the case&#x2014;I have mentioned this before in your Lordships' House&#x2014;that many managements are saying, "It is our turn now"? This new type of management will breed a backlash, when the upturn comes, of trade unions saying, "It is our turn now". This will go on and on, unless we grasp the nettle of what we are going to do in relationship with the trade unions.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01936"><member>Lord Scanlon</member><membercontribution>: That, if I may say so, would be the worst of all the alternatives, even worse than the present Government. The real question is: Are we going to develop an attitude of mind whereby Government, industry and trade unions work together instead of tearing each other apart? Unless we do something, there will be an inevitable backlash. My plea, especially if there is a return of the Conservative Government, is that some of the anticipated legislation should be dropped. Industrial relations are not encouraged by some of the more vitriolic remarks of Secretaries of State and Ministers who should know better than to poison the atmosphere as they are doing.<lb/>
It would be equally wrong to talk as if there has been no world recession and that we have not suffered the aftermath and our fair share of it. I shall not bore your
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0269"/>
<col>523</col>
Lordships with comparisons of how the recession has hit us harder than the rest of the industrialised countries and whose fault that is. That has already been covered by the contributions of noble Lords, especially on this side of the House. But reports of the present recovery are, I suggest, much like Mark Twain's premature obituary notice; that is to say, much exaggerated.<lb/>
The Government have been wrong before. We have been told about troughing out, turning the corner and recovery on the way. What real basis exists for believing that this is any more true now than it was? I know that the noble Lord the Minister has been asked to deal with producivity figures. This brings me to the CBI survey. It would be more correct to describe the CBI survey and its reaction as being rather less pessimistic than being more optimistic. Buried in the CBI report are some important caveats. Thirty-one per cent. of those asked think that the volume of new orders will go up in the next four months while 50 per cent. think that it will stay the same and 8 per cent. actually believe that it will fall.<lb/>
Again, as my noble friend Lord McIntosh indicated, perhaps a much better barometer of the state of the economy in the future would be this report of the NEDO. As I understand it, it is based on the collective reports of 40 active working parties dealing with the various sectors of the manufacturing base; they are tripartite and if they cannot give an accurate picture of the state of the economy, I do not know who can. That may well be the reason why it has not been published, and I hope that today's meeting of the NEDO has at least agreed to publish it as soon as possible.<lb/>
I have tried to say what the present position is and what the prospects are for the future. I now come to my final point; is there an alternative? Contrary to the much publicised statements, there is another way. It will be to give precedence to building our manufacturing base, to expanding our public commitments and expenditure and by so doing make a serious contribution&#x2014;and a heavy contribution&#x2014;to reducing this intolerable load on any economy of 3 million people anxious and willing to work and prevented from doing so by the very system under which we operate. That will cost money. Of that there can be no doubt. We must face this.<lb/>
It has been said before that it can be financed by the amount of money that we are spending on unemployment and by the tax revenues that are lost thereby. In part it can be financed by borrowing&#x2014;and which company does not borrow? What is wrong with borrowing if it is to invest in a sound, basic, viable manufacturing base? Nothing at all. There is everything to commend it.<lb/>
Therefore, finally, I believe that there should be some control over this amount of British money, both real and in the form of shares in portfolios, that goes abroad, to the extent of &#x00A3;10 million in 1982. Those are ready-made finances which I believe could finance the type of programme that is envisaged and which the electorate will have the chance of determining in the coming election. But above all&#x2014;and I make my plea on this&#x2014;whichever party is returned to government, if that manufacturing base is to be built up on the grounds that many of your Lordships have tried to
<col>524</col>
describe in this debate, it can only be done on the basis of consensus, not confrontation; on the idea that we shall work together&#x2014;industry, Government and trade unions&#x2014;in order to get that manufacturing base going and under way and producing the exports by which we shall increase our standard of living, and provide the hospitals, roads and so on which any caring society wants. That is the usefulness of this debate. I hope that that is the purpose of the coming general election.</membercontribution></p>

The House is indeed indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, for introducing this subject and for giving us a chance to express our views upon it.<lb/>
The fall in industrial production that has occurred over the last few years is very regrettable. The unhappy consequences of this are evident to us all. What is perhaps less clear is that most other industrialised countries have been suffering from the same problems, as the world passes through the worst recession for 50 years. The universal nature of the recession is illustrated by the growth figures for the major OECD economies. These had averaged 5 per cent. a year in the late 1960s and early 1970s&#x2014;that is, in the years before the first oil price explosion. Growth has now fallen to nil. Nearly all the industrialised countries have suffered from serious falls in industrial production, and high unemployment. In the United States, for example, industrial production fell by over 8 per cent. last year. In Canada the fall was around 11 per cent., while in Germany industrial production fell by nearly 3 per cent. in 1982. British industry has been affected by these developments more than in most countries because of the persistent problems accumulated over a decade or more&#x2014;inefficiency, low productivity, poor competitiveness, and too many stoppages and strikes. We were slow to adjust to growing competition from the newly industrialised countries, which, on the one hand, had access to cheaper labour and raw materials, hut, on the other, did not suffer from our unhappy legacy of industrial strife. As a result, the United Kingdom's share of world trade declined from 17&#x00B7;9 per cent. in 1959 to 9&#x00B7;1 per cent. in 1979. These were the figures referred to by my noble friend Lord Trenchard and I am happy to confirm them.<lb/>
This gradual decline in the United Kingdom's relative position in the world economy came to a head when our underlying weaknesses were coupled with the need for economic adjustment furthering a further surge in oil prices and rampant inflation or, to use the simile of my noble friend, when world growth declined to an extent that it no longer covered the inefficiences to which I have referred. This came at a time when the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0270"/>
<col>525</col>
business cycle was in any case due to turn down, with industrial production reaching a cyclical peak in the first half of 1979.<lb/>
The Government's basic strategy has been to create the right climate in which British industry can once again be internationally competitive, and in which a sustained recovery can be built. The cornerstone of this strategy has been the reduction of inflation. During the five years of labour rule preceding the last election inflation had averaged 15&#x00B7;4 per cent. Not only was this creating major social problems, but it also made it impossible for British industry to compete effectively in home and export markets.<lb/>
Success in the fight against inflation was therefore essential to any lasting recovery. To this end the Government adopted the Medium-Term Financial Strategy. A central part of the strategy is to create, over a period of years, a stable financial framework in order to achieve enduring changes in attitudes and expectations. The MTFS has made an important contribution to reducing inflation to its lowest level for almost 15 years. Lower inflation means that for given monetary growth there is more room for recovery in real activity.<lb/>
Within this basic strategy, the Government have done a great deal to cut industry's costs. Our success in reducing the public sector borrowing requirement as a percentage of GDP over a period of years has contributed in no small measure to the reduction in interest rates. Bank base rates are now 6 per cent. below their peak in October 1981. We have also cut the National Insurance surcharge&#x2014;Labour's tax on jobs&#x2014;by 2 per cent., with a further &#x00BD; per cent. reduction coming into effect from August. These reductions in NIS will put hack into private sector companies &#x00A3;2,000 million in a full year, while the lower interest rates to which I have referred have saved a similar sum. Moreover, measures taken by the Government to help industry adjust to higher world energy prices have led to savings in industry's energy costs of around &#x00A3;500 million over the last three years.<lb/>
Though the main aim of fiscal policy has been to reduce Government borrowing, and the overall tax burden is higher than would have been wished, there has been room in both of the last Budgets for substantial tax reductions. Indeed, but for the position adopted by the Opposition, there would have been more in this present one. In these and previous Budgets the Government have sought within the continuing framework of the medium term financial strategy to restore incentives, thus providing scope for enterprise and initiative. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the last Budget that the "small companies" rate of corporation tax is to be cut be 2 percentage points to 38 per cent., and the marginal rate limits substantially increased.<lb/>
The Budget contained over 15 measures to help small firms start up and grow. These include a major extension of the Business Start-up Scheme which will be renamed the Business Expansion Scheme. This should greatly ease the provision of equity capital to qualifying unquoted trading companies. The Loan Guarantee Scheme is also to be extended. Since-1979 a total of over 100 measures have been introduced to
<col>526</col>
help small firms start up and grow. Such measures are an important element of our strategy since many small firms will prove to be the nuclei of the great industrial concerns of tomorrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01940"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord also read the figures of these hundreds of thousands of firms who are now going to be helped and resuscitated who were strangled a few years before under the same Government?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01941"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, for some time now the figures have indicated that the growth and the rate of growth, and the rate of birth to use a better expression, of small companies has significantly exceeded the number of closures. In our efforts to create the right climate for industrial growth, the Government have sought to remove obstacles to industrial development and the efficient use of resources. We have been pursuing policies to improve the "supply" performance of the economy by providing greater incentives for work and enterprise, and by improving the operation of markets. The Government have removed a whole host of damaging controls, which had been holding industry back. We have now abolished hire purchase controls, as well as pay, price, dividend and exchange controls. On the subject of exchange controls, one or two noble Lords suggested that we ought to control the outflow of capital from this country. But, of course, to do that would strangle at the same time the important inflow of capital which we are seeing at the present time.<lb/>
Industrial development certificates and office development permits have been ended. The Government have alleviated the burden of the public sector on industry. Wherever possible we are returning state enterprises to the private sector. This represents by far the most effective means of extending market forces and improving efficiency. So far 10 major public corporations have been successfully privatised, including British Aerospace, Cable and Wireless, Britoil and the National Freight Corporation, which was returned to its employees. Nationalised industries which have enjoyed a monopoly position in the past are being subjected to the bracing wind of competition. For example, in February last year the Mercury consortium were given a licence to run an independent telecommunications network in competition with British Telecom.<lb/>
The Government's supply side measures include the setting up of 24 enterprise zones. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Bellwin announced yesterday that three local authorities in Kent had been invited to submit plans for a further enterprise zone. A consultant's report on the progress of the original 11 zones shows that in general they appear to be succeeding in their primary purpose of bringing new life and investment to some very run-down areas. Freeports are to be introduced in a limited number of locations. The Government are also acting to reduce labour market rigidities, which have been an important constraint on the United Kingdom's performance. This matter was much in the mind of my noble friend Lord Thomas. These latter measures will help to ensure that, as recovery develops, growth will be sustained and permanent.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0271"/>
<col>527</col>
My Lords, the Government recognises that we have also a more specific role to play in helping industry to adjust to new technologies, changes in demand patterns, increasing commercial risks and so on. We therefore provide selective help to industry. In 1983&#2013;84 the Department of Industry will be spending around &#x00A3;1.6 billion. The balance of this expenditure is being moved away from nationalised industries and public sector companies towards schemes to promote innovation in the new technologies. The proportion of the Department of Industry budget spent on nationalised industries and publicly-owned companies will fall from around 70 per cent. in 1980&#2013;81 to 40 per cent. in 1983&#2013;84, while that spent on innovation will rise from around 6 per cent. to 19 per cent.<lb/>
Innovation and the introduction of new technology are essential if British industry is to improve its competitiveness. With this in mind, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Industry announced on 17th March that the maximum level of grant under the Department's support for innovation programme would be maintained at 33&#x00BD; per cent. (rather than at 25 per cent.) for a further year to May 1984. In cash terms, our support for industrial research and development under the Science and Technology Act 1965 has risen from &#x00A3;57 million in the last year of the Labour Government to &#x00A3;230 million in 1983&#2013;84. In real terms this is an increase of 135 per cent.<lb/>
The range of schemes available to help industry adopt the technologies vital to its competitiveness is wide. I shall mention a few major examples. The Microprocessor Applications Project will allocate &#x00A3;85 million to a programme to increase awareness of the advantages and applications of microelectronics. &#x00A3;10 million has been allocated to help firms develop, install and manufacture robots. The Flexible Manufacturing Systems scheme will provide &#x00A3;35 million to accelerate the introduction by industry of computerised methods of production control. &#x00A3;40 million has been allocated to assist the development by United Kingdom industry of a wide range of optoelectronics technologies. In the field of software products a further &#x00A3;15 million has been allocated to assist the development of innovative software products by British industry&#x2014;a field of fundamental importance with the increasing adoption of computerised systems.<lb/>
My Lords, it is important to recognise that the Government are not just supporting new industries. Many of these schemes are designed to help existing industries become more efficient and productive. In addition to the existing programmes, my right honourable friend also announced on 15th March that a further &#x00A3;185 million was being added to the support for innovation programme over three years. This will be allocated particularly to a number of new schemes. For example the Small Engineering Firms Investment Scheme, which operated until the middle of last year, has proved so successful that we have reintroduced it. A new Innovation-Linked Investment Scheme will help firms improve their expertise in bringing into production, and marketing, new products.<lb/>
A second major new initiative, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Scanlon, which I recently announced to your Lordships, concerned advanced
<col>528</col>
information technology. Following the publication of the Alvey Report, around &#x00A3;200 million is to be allocated for the support of a major collaborative research programme by companies, Government research establishments and academic institutions.<lb/>
My Lords, at this point I owe your Lordships an apology. When I repeated that Statement to your Lordships, I said inadvertently that the TUC, when asked to express their views on the Alvey report, had not done so. I find that I am quite mistaken on that. They had indeed responded to the Alvey report quite positively, and I apologise both to the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, and to the TUC for that inadvertent error. I have, of course, written to both.<lb/>
Of course, the Secretary of State for Industry's longstanding powers under the Industry Act 1972&#x2014;now continued under Sections 7 and 8 of the Industrial Development Act 1982&#x2014;are still used to support industrial projects in regions of particularly high unemployment and/or projects making a major contribution to the national economic interest. Payments of grant by the department under Section 7 during the last financial year totalled around &#x00A3;100 million on regional selective assistance: since 1st May 1979 payments of automatic regional development grant have amounted to around &#x00A3;2,000 million. And since July 1979 &#x00A3;30 million of assistance has been offered for 59 industrial projects in the national interest. It is therefore quite wrong to suggest that this Government have disregarded the needs of industry in cases where it has been in the public interest for the Government to help.<lb/>
In the context of regional policy, I would particularly emphasise the problems which the West Midlands have been facing during the recession. More than one noble Lord referred to that particular area. The Government are conscious of the difficulties of this region, and, with this in mind have established a "Team for Innovation": my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Mr. Butcher, will take charge of the work of the team which will encourage firms to make the fullest use of all the national schemes of support for industry. The reintroduction of the Small Engineering Firms Investment Scheme, SEFIS 2 as it is called, to which &#x00A3;100 million has been allocated, and to which I referred a moment ago, should be of major benefit to the West Midlands, where there are so many small engineering firms.<lb/>
I shall now deal with one or two of the points that have been put to me this evening. First, in his opening remarks the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos, asked about the surplus of trade on manufactures in 1982. Indeed, he suggested that there was a deficit on that account. That is not the case. I agree that these figures are very complex and it is a question of whether shipping charges are included on imports, and nice points like that. But the noble Lord is mistaken in thinking that there is a deficit on the account of manufactured trade during 1982. If I may, I shall write to the noble Lord to give him some detail.<lb/>
I referred already in response to the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, to the position of small firms. While it is true that insolvencies have run at a distressingly high rate recently, nonetheless the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0272"/>
<col>529</col>
number of births of small firms is also running at a record high level and the number of new firms now being brought into existence substantially exceeds the number of firms closing down.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, mentioned public purchasing. I think that was in the mind of the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, as well. I agree that this can and should be applied in an enlightened way to encourage competitiveness. The Government acknowledge this and have pressed the importance of this approach on the nationalised industries and public bodies. I have no doubt that the noble Lord was the recipient of some of this pressure when he was the distinguished chairman of the Coal Board.<lb/>
We think that this is an enlightened policy, but at the same time we want to be careful not to embark on an indiscriminate "buy British" policy, although the Government are in a number of ways supporting the introduction of new products through public purchasing. For example there are over 20 pilot office automation schemes in the public sector which are being assisted in this way. I should sound a small note of warning about this approach and that is that under the GATT agreements and the terms of our membership of the EEC we are obliged to ensure that we do not impose any barriers upon overseas firms tendering for the work of our public bodies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01942"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may, I should like to comment on that point. I am conscious of the need to ensure that we keep to our international obligations. The whole purpose of the purchasing policy that I was proposing was that we would be purchasing from home sources because they were competitive with overseas sources.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01943"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wholly accept that point and entirely agree.<lb/>
A number of noble Lords, indeed most noble Lords who have spoken, and the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, who spoke with particular eloquence, referred to the problems of alleviating the worst effects of unemployment. Some 621,000 people are covered by special employment and training measures, although the effect on the unemployment register is rather less than that. The Government spent &#x00A3;1&#x00BD;, billion in 1982&#2013;83, 40 per cent. more than in 1981&#2013;82, on special employment and training measures and &#x00A3;2 billion has been allocated for 1983&#2013;84. The new community programme designed to provide up to 130,000 places for the long-term unemployed began in October last year and the new job-splitting subsidy scheme began in January to encourage extension of part-time work and to provide additional opportunities for productive jobs for unemployed people.<lb/>
In the autumn the youth training scheme will begin at a cost of some &#x00A3;950 million a year. The new scheme will provide a foundation year of occupational and industrially relevant training for all 16-year-old school-leavers and 17-year-old unemployed school-leavers and will also apply to some employed young people. It was announced in the Budget that from 1st October the job release scheme will include a new scheme for part-time job release for up to 40,000 more
<col>530</col>
people, and from 1st August enterprise allowances will be available throughout the country within an overall cash limit of &#x00A3;25 million in 1983&#2013;84.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01944"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask a very short question? In his interesting speech the noble Lord has made no reference to our oil and the difference that can make to the whole situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01945"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be misleading your Lordships if I were to suggest that the oil were anything other than of the greatest benefit to our present economy. However, the oil industry does not form part of the manufacturing industry which is the essence of our debate this evening.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01946"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I may have misheard and I am sure the noble Lord the Minister would not want to mislead the House, but did he not imply that the scheme was for unemployed 16-year-olds in the main? I thought it was to apply to all 16-year-olds who were to benefit from the youth training scheme? Surely the point of the scheme is that it is not to be confined to the unemployed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01947"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: That is exactly so, my Lords. I said that it would apply to the people that the noble Baroness is hoping and expecting it will apply to.<lb/>
There are now clear signs that industry is responding to the new climate we are creating. Productivity&#x2014;that is, output per head&#x2014;in manufacturing has risen about 16 per cent. since the end of 1980. It is now about 9 per cent. above the average for 1979. Pay settlements are now being reached at much lower levels. As a result, manufacturers' unit wage and salary costs rose by only about 3&#x00BD; per cent. in the three months to February compared with a year earlier. This compares favourably with our major competitors overseas. The cost competitiveness of manufacturing industry has improved by around 20 per cent. since early 1981.<lb/>
Last year British exporters of manufactured goods succeeded in at least checking the decline in their share of world export markets. There are also growing signs that the improved performance is beginning to feed through into increased output. Industrial production rose by 1&#x00BD;per cent. in the three months to February, compared with the previous three months, and manufacturing output rose by 1 per cent. Gross domestic product has recovered by 2 per cent. since its trough in the spring of 1981.<lb/>
Indeed, there are now a large number of indicators pointing to a more general economic recovery. Total housing starts in the three months to February were up 33 per cent. compared with the previous three months. For the first time ever new car sales have topped half a million in the three months to March. Registrations during the first four months of this year were 16&#x00B7;6 per cent. up on the corresponding period for 1982. Consumer expenditure and retail sales are also running strongly. The Central Statistical Office's index of leading cyclical indicators points to a continued upswing in the business cycle.<lb/>
For three months in succession the CBI Industrial Trends Survey indicates that the number of manufacturers who see signs of improvement
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0273"/>
<col>531</col>
outnumber these who do not. The April Quarterly Trends Survey showed encouraging improvements in orderbooks and output expectations, a slowdown in destocking and job shedding, and improved investment intentions. The response to the overall business optimism question has been bettered on only three occasions in the last 25 years.<lb/>
Although there is still a long way to go, recovery has begun&#x2014;of that there is no doubt. In the past there have been signs of recovery which have not been sustained because the world economy turned down. Now, however, there are clear signs of growth particularly in those countries which have been successful in the fight against inflation. In the United States, for example, industrial production has risen for four months in a row. That Administration has revised from 3 per cent. to 4&#x00BD; per cent. its estimate of growth this year. In West Germany, industrial production in the two months to February rose by 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. on the previous two months. The continued restraint in wage bargaining means that British industry is in a position to take full and permanent advantage of this international upturn. The prospect now is for a growth in GDP of about 2 per cent. in 1983, with continuing improvement in profitability.<lb/>
The Government have done a great deal to create the conditions in which industry can achieve sustained recovery and prosperity. The process of adjustment has been painful but there was no alternative to it, given our poor industrial performance, which had been getting worse over a long period of time. The reduction of inflation and improved competitiveness represent the only route to the sustained economic and industrial recovery which we all wish to see. Increased Government expenditure on the scale which some have called for in order to boost demand is the route to higher inflation, and hence to lower real output and fewer jobs. It would certainly not bring the sustained industrial recovery to which this Government are committed.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01951"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill started as a Private Member's Bill in another place, where it was piloted by my right honourable friend Sir Angus Maude, who
<col>532</col>
for 28 years has been a much respected Member of another place. Except when he was in the Government, he always entered the ballot for Private Members' Bills, as most of us did. Although he balloted no less than 26 times it was only in this last Session of his last Parliament that he both won a place in the ballot and got his Bill through all its stages in another place. The Bill got a Second Reading on the nod but it was fully discussed in Committee and on Third Reading&#x2014;and especially on Third Reading. Throughout its passage in another place, not a single Member of any party either voted or spoke against it. Indeed, there was one honourable Member who suggested that it did not go far enough and that the &#x00A3;1,000 limit that it contained should be perhaps &#x00A3;1,500 or &#x00A3;2,000.<lb/>
As stated in the Long Title, the Bill's purpose is to enable property of certain small charities to be expended without regard to restrictions contained in their trust instruments distinguishing between capital and income. The Bill in another place had the support of the Government and, I assume, will have it here. The Bill amends and slightly enlarges the powers contained in the Charities Act 1960; and does so not by making any drastic changes in the powers and duties contained in that Act but by adding a modest, new section to it with some minor consequentials. I should disclose that I helped with the preparation of the Charities Act 1960 and was responsible for piloting it through its Committee and Report stages&#x2014;and, looking back, a very strenuous exercise it was&#x0021; I had the valuable help in another place at that time of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Simon of Glaisdale, who was then Solicitor-General.<lb/>
Last Friday, in the debate on the Second Reading of the Parochial Charities Neighbourhood Trust Bill introduced by my noble friend Lady Faithfull, the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, on the Opposition Benches, was good enough to say that the passing of the Charities Act 1960 was a monumental achievement. Indeed, at the time it was regarded as the most far-reaching measure on the subject of charities since the Act of Queen Elizabeth I. Although it contained wide powers to vary, amalgamate and transfer charitable trusts, I never thought, speaking for myself, that 22 years would pass before any serious attempt was made to improve or strengthen it or to widen the powers that it gave. However, in this Session we have had two such attempts. One, by my noble friend, we discussed last Friday, and now we have this Bill.<lb/>
Before I describe the Bill's effects in law, perhaps I may briefly describe the situation with which it is designed to deal. Of the 140,000 or so charities registered with the Charities Commission, more than half have an annual income of less than &#x00A3;100 and the Chief Custodian of Charities estimates that, in 1980, a dividend of less than &#x00A3;1 was paid out on at least 7,000 holdings of land held by charitable trusts.<lb/>
As your Lordships will know, most small charities are parochial ones with limited objects. The cost of administering them often exceeds their annual income. Many examples could be given of the frustration experienced by their trustees, but let me give your Lordships one example which, I suggest, fairly illustrates the problem with which trustees are faced. This example which I am going to give could be
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0274"/>
<col>533</col>
multiplied with variations many times. There is a 19th-century village clock tower and charity trustees are required to maintain it by using an income of &#x00A3; 18 a year, being the rent from a small piece of land worth about &#x00A3;400. The tower needs urgent repair which would cost at least &#x00A3;400. What are they to do? Are they to let the clock tower fall to pieces because they say that, in accordance with the trust deed, they must not spend more than &#x00A3;18 a year on it? Surely, it is obviously right that they should apply&#x2014;as they can already do&#x2014;to the Charity Commissioners for permission to sell the land and it is also right to use the proceeds of the sale&#x2014;and they are capital&#x2014;for repairing the clock tower. But, under the law as it now stands, they cannot use the proceeds of the sale if it is capital. So this Bill would enable them to use the proceeds for that purpose. That is but one example.<lb/>
The Bill does not oblige trustees&#x2014;there is nothing compulsory about it&#x2014;to use capital to fulfil the objects of the trust. The Bill leaves it to the discretion of the trustees except that, as I say, they must get the consent of the Charity Commissioners if they need to sell land, and they need to do that already.<lb/>
My Lords, the point I want to stress, which is at the heart of the Bill and which has been the subject of so much misunderstanding, is that they can use the proceeds of sale only for fulfilling the objects of the trust. Inevitably, that may mean bringing the trust to an end. In the case that I gave of the clock tower, it would bring the trust to an end. But surely it is better to use the capital and bring the trust to an end than to defeat the objects of the trust altogether by merely relying upon a minimal useless income which may not even be enough to pay the costs of administration.<lb/>
I suggest that it is not an entirely new thing to bring a trust to an end. For centuries the courts have had power to sanction the winding up of charitable trusts whose objects have failed or which could not fulfil their function, or which could not be performed. But that power on the part of the courts has always been subject to the application of the <i>cy-pr&#x00E9;s</i> doctrine which requires the trustees, on the direction of the court, to apply the trust property if there is any left, but the <i>cy-pr&#x00E9;s</i> doctrine applies only when there is a genuine charitable intent. I have also fairly to concede that a genuine charitable intent can very often be inferred, but I make the point about the powers that already exist merely to reassure those who think it is wrong ever to bring a charitable trust to an end. I suggest that, in the circumstances which the Bill envisages, it may be the only sensible thing to do. It may be inevitable.<lb/>
That is the broad purpose of the Bill. It applies only to trusts which are 40 years old. The reason why 40 years was chosen by my right honourable friend Sir Angus Maude and approved in the other place, was that they are the ones which have been affected by inflation in the post-war years. The maximum sum specified in the Bill is not more than &#x00A3;1,000 of capital, but under the Bill the Home Secretary has power to increase that amount and might in future, in view of inflation, have to do so. But before he can do that, he has to lay an order before both Houses and the consent of both Houses would be required.<lb/>
My Lords, the Bill applies only to England and Wales because, as my noble friend Lord Drumalbyn
<col>534</col>
knows&#x2014;and I am pleased to see him in his place&#x2014;the law of Scotland is slightly different with regard to charities. The Bill follows the recommendations made by both the Expenditure Committee in another place which considered the matter in 1975, and the Committee of the noble Lord, Lord Goodman, on the Law of Charity in 1976. To me it is most surprising that this Bill should have been criticised in the way it has been. I can only assume that those noble Lords who did criticise it could not have understood how necessary are its modest purpose and scope.<lb/>
In the nature of things at this late stage of this Parliament, neither this Bill nor that of my noble friend Lady Faithfull can reach the Statute Book, but I hope our short debate tonight might lead to a better understanding of this important and sometimes difficult subject. Your Lordships will have noticed that on the Order Paper today we find that:
<quote>"In the event of the Bill being read a Second time, the Baroness Faithfull to move, That the Bill be committed to the Select Committee to which the Parochial Charities (Neighbourhood Trusts) Bill [H.L.] has been committed."</quote>
My Lords, I have discussed this matter with my noble friend Lady Faithfull. I have an open mind as to the best way to handle this, but it is her wish and that of others that I should at the end of my reply to this debate withdraw my Motion for Second Reading, and then there will be no question of her Motion having to be put. Therefore, my Lords, that is all I have to say for the moment, and I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01956"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I think we all know of the great service he has given, and it is a little sad that in 28 years it is possible only to draw in the ballot twice. Therefore, it gives me particular sorrow in feeling and thinking that I cannot support the Charities Bill. I would say to my noble friend Lord Renton that I do understand it, but I still do not agree with it.<lb/>
My Lords, I will not detain your Lordships long, but I think I should say that I cannot agree that charities with a capital of &#x00A3;1,000 or less should be dissipated. Each of these brings in a small amount, but if amalgamated into neighbourhood trusts as recommended in the Parochial Charities (Neighbourhood Trusts) Bill which we debated last week in your Lordships' House, then a greater contribution in the way of income could be made along the lines of the original bequest.<lb/>
My Lords, may I say to my noble friend Lord Renton, that it is astonishing how near and yet how far are the two Bills, because if the neighbourhood trusts were to amalgamate the income of the trusts in one area, then his clock would still be repaired under the neighbourhood trusts. If trustees are willing to give away capital, then surely they would not object to the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0275"/>
<col>535</col>
capital and income being given to a neighbourhood trust. My Lords, I repeat&#x2014;is there such a wide gap?<lb/>
Secondly, as I understand the recommendations of the Nathan Committee, the Select Committee and the Goodman Committee, allowance was made as stated by my noble friend for the destruction of small charities, but all three committees made further recommendations that it was infinitely preferable for them to be amalgamated into neighbourhood trusts. Indeed, this policy was agreed by the Charity Commission itself long ago.<lb/>
Thirdly, for many of us the Charities Bill offends the basic principle of charity law on which donors have relied; namely, that a charitable trust cannot be allowed to fail unless it is absolutely necessary. The Bill does not define what is meant by "a value not exceeding &#x00A3;1,000". Does it mean the nominal value of investments or the market value? The difference between the nominal and market values obviously has important effects both on the number of charities which can be destroyed and the amount of income which would be lost.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Renton, has said that he will withdraw his Motion and, as he has stated, he and I have agreed on this. Naturally, therefore, I shall not move my motion on the Order Paper. Suffice it to say that in the future a common-sense approach must surely be taken. I believe that a common-sense approach dictates that we should have not two charity Bills but one, and that the Charities Bill and Parochial Charities and Neighbourhood Trusts Bill should together be referred to a Select Committee of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01957">8.1 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01958"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House will be indebted to both the noble Lord, Lord Renton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, for their contributions in regard to this Bill which has come to us from the other place. When we were discussing the Bill brought forward with such eloquence by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, I think the House felt that we were dealing with a very complex issue in regard to parochial trusts and the whole question of their being converted into neighbourhood trusts.<lb/>
Some of us felt that there was something very sound in the principle of the noble Baroness's Bill but, again, some of us were a little reluctant to agree to the terms as they stood&#x2014;although obviously we wanted to give it a Second Reading&#x2014;without having the data before us which apparently the Charity Commissioners could not supply, and without seeing really what was involved regarding the administration of the Bill when certain burdens were cast upon local authorities and also indeed upon the Charity Commissioners. Therefore we were very happy with the idea of the matter being referred to a Select Committee of your Lordships' House which would look into the whole question of parochial trusts. We all came to that conclusion in good faith and we felt that we were doing something which was very valuable for charity law and administration in the future. We felt we were possibly getting rid of all the waste and the difficult duties of trustees in regard to small trusts, which were mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, in his speech.<lb/>
<col>536</col>
What we also wanted to do&#x2014;this was, I know, very much in the mind of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull&#x2014;was to see that we made no decisions which were likely to be nullified by what might happen to another Bill which was also dealing with small charities. Therefore, we thought we were entitled to ask the noble Lord, Lord Elton, who, with his usual ability, was dealing with the Neighbourhood Trusts Bill, what the Government's attitude was to another Bill about which some of us had doubts. That was indeed the Charities Bill, to which the noble Lord, Lord Renton, drew our attention. As he very movingly said, that Bill had been sponsored in another place by a right honourable gentleman who has the admiration of everybody engaged in public life, on whichever Benches they might sit. Therefore, it was felt to be only right that the Minister of State in the Home Office in another place should pay him a warm tribute when this matter came before that House. Of course, that happened on the very day that we were debating the Bill brought forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull.<lb/>
I do not think any of us would concede that the fact that you succeed in a ballot on only two occasions and that you have led such a meritorious life in Parliament, necessarily means that a Bill you might sponsor has to be passed. If I may say so, it is adapting charity in the wrong way, although of course one would always want to be gracious in dealing with a Bill which came from another place and from such a source.<lb/>
We were anxious because, as your Lordships will realise, this Bill deals with small charities and if it were to come into effect and be put on the statute book, and if the Bill of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, were to be delayed by reference to the deliberations of a Select Committee, many small charities might go by the board before they had any chance, if the noble Baroness's Bill were passed, of coming within the purview of neighbourhood trusts. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, quite correctly, said that many of these small charities did indeed come within parochial trusts; and so obviously it would be a great disadvantage if that Bill became law while the other Bill was being delayed.<lb/>
Some of us also had doubts about the so-called voluntary nature of the Bill now before the House, as against the compulsory nature, as it was described, of the Bill brought forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull. It did not seem to some of us that it was entirely a voluntary measure with the full acquiescence of the settlor, when this was a power given to his trustees and when the settlor might himself have had very different views. And, after all, it might be that the remaining trustees, after 40 years, who succeeded upon other trustees, would feel that once this Bill was passed they could ask: "Why not get rid of our obligations, because they are an awful nuisance?" So we were extremely keen to see that the two Bills ran together, if I might put it in that way, so that they could be considered by a Select Committee and then in due course your Lordships would be able to see what the recommendations of the Select Committee might be.<lb/>
In the course of the questions we put to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, on that occasion, I find that we came across an amazing constitutional point&#x2014;or it
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0276"/>
<col>537</col>
may be a traditional point&#x2014;of procedure. Presumably, the noble Lord the Minister was adhering faithfully to that constitutional point and that procedure in the answers that he gave to the House. But I think he would be the first person to say that if you follow that constitutional procedure you are not giving the House an opportunity&#x2014;I understand that he could not help himself&#x2014;of knowing what the true position really was.<lb/>
I am going to tell your Lordships what the true position is and, if I may say so, I am not now speaking on behalf of my Front Bench but merely talking individually as someone dealing with this Bill and with this problem. In fact, by 12.30 last Friday afternoon in another place, the Bill which is now before your Lordships had received a Third Reading and had been passed. The right honourable gentleman the Minister of State at the Home Office in another place&#x2014;I am reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, that it was the Under-Secretary of State, and I am grateful to him&#x2014;announced very definitely that the Bill now before your Lordships had full Government support and approval. It would have been of great assistance to you Lordships in knowing what to do in regard to the Select Committee, and the way in which it was dealing with the Bill of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, if you had known that that was the position; that the other Bill had already been passed and had Government support.<lb/>
If the questions put in your Lordships' House by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, the noble Lord, Lord Allen, and myself, had been answered on the basis that this Bill in another place had Government support and had been passed, we would then have known where we stood and I think we would have said various things in regard to the Select Committee, and so on. As I said, those questions were put an hour and a half after the Bill was passed in another place on 6th May, but the Bill now before your Lordships reached this House, as a matter of technicality, only on 9th May.<lb/>
Therefore, presumably, if I have correctly understood the tradition of both Houses and the constitutional position, it was not open to the noble Lord the Minister to tell us that that had happened. If that be so, I merely say, as a humble Member of your Lordships' House, that that appears to be a very undesirable position, because your Lordships were taking decisions without knowing what had happened an hour and a half earlier in regard to this very Bill. But, as I said, the position has been frankly discussed with me and the noble Lord the Minister had no alternative but to do what he did and say what he said. In those&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01959"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, for giving way. But I am amazed by the noble Lord's amazement at this. We have this position where, by a strange coincidence, there were two separate Bills, each of them suggesting a diametrically opposed alternative to solve the same problem, coming up in the two Houses of Parliament on the same day. My honourable friend in another place, having heard the arguments in another place, gave his support and the support of the Government to
<col>538</col>
that Bill. My noble friend Lord Elton, who was listening to our consideration of the Bill of my noble friend Lady Faithfull in this House, having heard the arguments in this House agreed that that Bill should be sent to a Select Committee. These were the two positions in the two Houses on the same day.<lb/>
Government's have often been accused of not listening, and on this occasion in another place they listened to the arguments on the Bill that my noble friend is presenting today, and they decided that that Bill should have their support. In your Lordships' House, on the same day, they listened to the arguments on the Bill of my noble friend Lady Faithfull and they decided on the Select Committee issue. Having looked at the two positions together, it became apparent that the two things were incompatible. Therefore, Her Majesty's Government have obviously changed their minds on my noble friend's Bill, because of the arguments that were put in both places on the same day. If there is anything reprehensible in that, I hope that any Government that I have anything to do with will be reprehensible in this way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01960"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, resumes, I think that he would wish to be corrected on the timing. He rose at 11.47 a.m. in your Lordships' House and, I would estimate, started to put his questions at about 12 noon. The Third Reading in another place was not completed until 12.30 p.m., and my noble friend Lord Elton rose to make his contribution to the debate at 13 minutes past one. So there was not an interval of an hour and a half, or anything like it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01961"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Denham, acclaims the contribution that has just been made by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, I had better refer the noble Lord, Lord Renton, to a debate which took place in your Lordships' House on the question of opticians and their monopoly, and the examination of eyes, because I have before me in the <i>Official Report</i> exactly when it was that I put my questions to the noble Lord, Lord Elton. I put them in the course of his speech, which started at 1.13 p.m.&#x2014;and I refer him to column 300&#x2014;and certainly not at 11 o'clock. The debate&#x2014;and I think that is what the noble Lord is possibly referring to&#x2014;commenced earlier, but I am talking about the questions that were put and the time when I, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and others, put them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01962"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was naturally drawing attention to the very short time between the conclusion of the proceedings in another place, and the moment when my noble friend Lord Elton rose to make his contribution to our debate&#x2014;a time of only 43 minutes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01963"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord reads the <i>Official Report</i> tomorrow, he will find that he was making the point against me that there was every good reason why what occurred should have occurred, because I made my contribution and asked these questions at 11.30 a.m., which was something like an hour before the Bill was passed in another place. However, may I just deal with the point which the noble Lord, Lord Denham, made? As I said, I am in no position to make any representations on behalf of the Opposition Front Bench or anything of that kind in
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0277"/>
<col>539</col>
regard to procedure. I was merely making a personal point, But, with great respect, his point is not very well taken, if he will allow me to say so.<lb/>
I say that for this reason. Quite obviously, there was a position where the Government had taken a definite stand, not after the long debate on the other Bill; it was taken immediately. There was not a long debate and there were only four contributions. There was no Second Reading discussion at all in another place on the Bill. The point that was made, which is contrary to the one that the noble Lord, Lord Denham, was making, was that there was nothing inconsistent between the two Bills. The noble Baroness is nodding her head in agreement. That was the great point. There was nothing inconsistent between them. Therefore, while it was perfectly consistent for one Bill to go to a Select Committee, it was perfectly in order for the other Bill, which was not inconsistent with the Bill of the noble Baroness, to be passed through all its stages in another place.<lb/>
If the Government have had second thoughts and realise, as the noble Lord, Lord Denham, said, that the two Bills are inconsistent in the way that they are trying to deal with the same problem, then one would expect that in another Parliament, when this matter comes again before the House, the Government will agree that both Bills will go to a Select Committee or that we shall have the benefit of a Select Committee before we make a decision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01964"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think this is true. But, if I may say so, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, is less than gracious in not accepting the fact that Her Majesty's Government, have, in these two Houses of Parliament, heard the debates on these two separate Bills, have listened to the arguments, and have come to what I think is a fairly fair decision in regard to both of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01965"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that I am always gracious and I should have thought that the noble Lord, Lord Denham, in the circumstances of this case, would have paid tribute to the gracious way in which I tried to deal with a certain situation. I am equally surprised that he did not, in fact, pay that tribute in view of what has transpired. Having said that, I hope that the discussion upon procedure and tradition, and what happened in another place, can be terminated and I turn&#x2014;I promise very briefly&#x2014;to the provisions of this Bill.<lb/>
The Bill must be looked at very carefully. It is not so simple as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, made it out to be. He has the great art of making complicated matters sound simple to himself and to others. But he was not quite right; for example, the Goodman Committee approved the principle of the Bill which is before the House without imposing conditions. I quote from col. 573 of the proceedings of 6th May in another place. The Minister, Mr. David Mellor, said:
<quote>"The Goodman committee endorsed this view"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, the principle of the Bill&#x2014;
<quote>"and recommended that power to expend capital should be given, subject to appropriate consent by the local committee. It had in mind a permanent local committee to be established under the chairmanship of a representative of the Charity Commissioners to look after the continuing process of co-ordination between endowed charities and welfare services".</quote>
<col>540</col>
No such condition is imposed by the Bill. No such procedure is suggested in it.<lb/>
The second point which one has to consider is the failure of charities. Failure is completely inconsistent with the charity law as we know it, one of its distinctive features being that a charity is not allowed to fail. Third, it appears that one has to consider the idea of small charities being wound up. May I use an argument which was employed by the Government against the Bill of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull. One has to allow for the situation that settlors may decide that they are not going to create fresh charitable trusts if there is the possibility of those trusts being wound up. If that is an argument which can be used against the Bill of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, it is an argument which can also be used against this Bill.<lb/>
These matters have very rightly been brought before Parliament. Much work has to be done on the charity law, charity administration and parochial trusts. If we are spared to sit in this Chamber after the eventful days ahead of us&#x2014;though sitting, I hope, precisely opposite to where we are sitting now&#x2014;I trust that we shall agree to deal with the charity law and parochial trusts by means of a Bill similar to the meritorious Bill of the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, and the equally meritorious Bill of Sir Angus Maude, having the benefit of the deliberations of a Select Committee which ought to be appointed. I am sure that your Lordships will ensure that it is appointed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01966">8.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01967"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Renton for his explanation of the Bill. May I also be allowed to pay my tribute to my right honourable friend Sir Angus Maude who, just over four months ago, presented this Bill in another place, Although there are areas of controversy which could inhibit its Second Reading, its humanitarian basic purpose affords a most cogent testament to the long and distinguished dedication of my right honourable friend to the cause of whatever is good.<lb/>
It was common ground last Friday that we must unlock these dead funds so that they may be put to a useful charitable purpose. The only controversy is how best this may be done. The substance of this controversy relates to the method by which we prise open these locks to release the funds. Here, as some of us believe, the means proposed by the Parochial Charities Bill and this Bill lie in irreconcilable conflict or, to use the more colourful expression of my noble friend Lord Denham, they are diametrically opposed alternatives, or are incompatible.<lb/>
During the Second Reading of the Parochial Charities Bill it became all too apparent that on this issue of conflict there were two irreconcilable views: the view of noble Lords who favour the neighbourhood trust method and the lone ministerial view, voiced by my noble friend the Minister, who favours the method proposed by the Charities Bill. This is not the time when anybody would wish to hear detailed argument. I agree with my noble friend Lady Faithfull that the clock illustration takes the matter no further. The Charities Bill was passed by another place with the support of the Government. So be it. However, it became clear last Friday in your Lordships' House that there is a genuine and serious area of controversy.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0278"/>
<col>541</col>
As that Bill is to a certain extent being discussed today, perhaps I may be permitted to seek to lay two ghosts in the argument. The first is that this Bill is to be preferred to the Parochial Charities Bill because it favours the voluntary principle. That view was expressed on Friday at col. 305 by my noble friend the Minister. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London reflected the views of other noble Lords who took part in the debate when he opined that the policy of this Bill was based upon the destruction not only of parochial charities but also of the important voluntary interest&#x2014;contrary, I have to confess, to the views expressed today by my noble friend Lord Renton.<lb/>
The second argument is that whatever may be the constitutional position&#x2014;such matters are beyond me; I would not seek to venture upon that kind of ground&#x2014;it is inconceivable that after the committal of the Parochial Charities Bill to a Select Committee it could ever be consistent with such a decision to allow the Charities Bill to proceed further in your Lordships' House for any other purpose than committal to a Select Committee, having regard to the irreconcilable conflict or the diametrically opposed alternatives to which reference has been made.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01970"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, and I am even more obliged to my noble friend Lord Denham for what he has just said. I am not trying to be controversial&#x2014;I am trying to avoid being controversial and I hope that I am succeeding. I am dealing with a point that was touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, but I am not putting it forward in quite the same way.<lb/>
Of course there is general consensus among all your Lordships and in another place that something must be done about the situation described by my noble friend Lord Renton. The problem is that there is no unanimity as to what should be done, and there is no unanimity in your Lordships' House, as to the method by which these funds should be released for a charitable purpose. Hence, as was recognised on Friday, the inestimable value of the report of a Select Committee which may in due course be constituted. If I may be allowed to express a purely personal opinion, I hope that it will be&#x2014;and perhaps the sooner the better.<lb/>
In conclusion, as the Motion to set up the Select Committee has not been implemented&#x2014;because if it had been implemented that Select Committee would have been all but stillborn&#x2014;there appears to be no good purpose in any Second Reading. I am most grateful, as always, to my noble friend Lord Renton for his intimations in this regard.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01972"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a preliminary to welcoming my noble friend's Bill into this House, I should like to endorse his decision not to take it beyond Second Reading today. It would not be right to put the Bill of my noble friend Lady Faithfull into a Select Committee as though it were a sort of siding and then to signal the Bill of my noble friend Lord Renton past it on the fast track at high speed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, was kind enough and gracious enough to telephone me earlier today to warn me that he would be raising this matter. I received that warning with all the anxious attention and gratitude which one gives to a dentist when he says, "This may hurt a little". If I have a cavity, I apologise for it. But I should like to say one further word to set the record straight: then I shall be done, because your Lordships have spent some entertaining time on it already.<lb/>
Your Lordships made it very clear last week that you view my noble friend's proposed measure with a great deal of sympathetic interest and I blessed its remission to a Select Committee. I was prevented by the conventions of this House from predicting how we would favour the Bill when it came here. The fine points about timing need not concern us too much because, as I understand the convention, it is not until the Bill reaches this House that one records one's attitude to it. That may be irksome to your Lordships, but it was at least as irksome to me last week. It then became clear to us that in those circumstances, if we were to assist the Bill of my noble friend Lord Renton through all its stages in one day, your Lordships could properly claim that we had sought to go behind your backs. That was in no way our intention and we therefore thought it right not to pursue that aim.<lb/>
None the less, having expressed last week the considerable doubts and reservations which the Government feel about parts of the Bill of my noble friend Lady Faithfull&#x2014;and in particular about the vigorous strain of compulsion which runs through it&#x2014;I must also make clear the reasons we have for regarding the Bill of my noble friend Lord Renton as a welcome measure.<lb/>
The trustees of small charities face very real problems. All of us recognise that. All of us wish to help them to resolve them and to do so in a way consistent both with the wishes of the trustees in so far as they can be met and with the more effective use of such money as is at their disposal. Two Bills have been brought before this House. One is very much more far-reaching than the other, but both have this particular aim in view, and both embody a principle that is exactly the same. That principle is, that the smallest of charities shall be capable of being wound up. In the Bill, the test of smallness is in Clause 1; that the capital value shall he under &#x00A3;1,000. In Clause 6 of the Bill we considered last week, the test is also there; that the annual income shall be under &#x00A3;10. There is a difference of magnitude between them, but there is no difference of principle. My two noble friends are friends also to each other in this, and I support them.<lb/>
To preserve intact a principle that charities shall never fail is to fly in the face of the practical effects of
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0279"/>
<col>543</col>
not allowing them to cease. There are cases where the expenditure of capital is certainly the best and possibly the only way of meeting both the needs of the beneficiaries and the wishes of the benefactor. My noble friend Lord Renton referred to a clock tower. I have dreamed up the roof of a memorial hall in a hamlet which is suddenly dissolved with dry rot. If that were to happen, &#x00A3;1,000 or even &#x00A3;500 now will be of practical use while the promise of &#x00A3;40, &#x00A3;90 or even &#x00A3;100 a year for a decade will not start to keep the rain out. The doctrine of the stitch in time seems to us to be as ancient and valid as the doctrine of <i>cy-pr&#x00E9;s</i> and we ought not to neglect either of them.<lb/>
The principle that lies at the foundation of the Bill&#x2014;that is, to enable a charity better to serve its purposes when circumstances would otherwise render that impracticable&#x2014;is no new thing. It has already been put forward in two important reports. In 1975 the Expenditure Committee was looking at the accountability of the Charity Commissioners, and the commissioners suggested to the committee that the trustees of charities with a total capital value of less than &#x00A3;50 should be empowered, with the consent of the trustees, to spend their capital. The Expenditure Committee accepted this recommendation. The committee thought that such changes should normally be made with the consent of the trustees but then contemplated some departure from that principle by recommending in addition that there should be reserve powers to act without their consent.<lb/>
The following year, this proposal was echoed in the report of the Goodman Committee on Charity Law and Voluntary Organisations. This committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Goodman (who must be one of the more frequently quoted Members of your Lordships' House) had been set up by the National Council for Social Service. They, too, recommended that small charities should be allowed to spend their capital, and this principle is again incorporated in the Bill we discussed last week. But, while the principle is the same, there are important differences from some aspects of the earlier proposals. Unlike the proposals of the Expenditure Committee, the Bill of my noble friend Lord Renton does not, first of all, permit the capital to be expended without the consent of the trustees. Indeed, it will be the trustees who initiate the action, if any, which the Bill would permit if it were to be enacted&#x2014;and we have no way of knowing how many trustees will take the opportunity so afforded to them.<lb/>
Secondly, the trustees will not need the consent of the Charity Commissioners in order to expend their capital. Like my noble friend, we think that the trustees must be the best judges of the most fitting use of their small capital. If many of them were to want to take advantage of what his Bill proposes, the involvement of the commissioners in every case would enormously hamper their work and produce little, if anything, in the way of benefit. But any trust of which the value of the permanent endowment exceeded the figure set in the Bill would, of course, be protected with exactly the same vigour as is now the case. The expenditure of their trust capital against the terms of the trust will attract the same sanctions as at present.<lb/>
I look forward to seeing this measure before your Lordships in the next Parliament&#x2014;I hope from this
<col>544</col>
side of the House. On reflection, your Lordships may see it as being not irreconcilable&#x2014;in the words of my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway&#x2014;with that brought in last week by my other noble friend. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will do something then to soften the disappointment that my right honourable friend&#x2014;indeed my thrice honourable friend&#x2014;Sir Angus Maude must inevitably feel this day, that he cannot bring in this as the coping stone to a long and admirable career. But, for the reasons I have given, I think it ought not to complete its journey through this House in a single day as at one time seemed appropriate. I am grateful to my noble friend for his lucid explanation of what he has in mind. I ought to say in conclusion that I take in good part everything the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, has said; I think there is no rancour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01973">8.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01974"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I express my thanks to all those noble Lords who have taken part in this debate. I am sure that whatever failings may have been laid at the feet of my noble friend Lord Elton last Friday can now be taken away; he has indeed atoned for any shortcomings on that occasion by his lucid explanation tonight of the Government's attitude towards this Bill.<lb/>
I should like to join in the tributes which have been paid to my right honourable friend Sir Angus Maude. I served with him in another place, and indeed knew him right back in the 1920s at Oxford&#x2014;that is a confession to make&#x0021; I always had the highest regard for him and must share the disappointment that he feels. Indeed, when he invited me to take on this Bill in your Lordships' House, there was an air of enthusiasm that he exuded that he would at last have got his Bill on the Statute Book. It may be some consolation to him that he has been much luckier than I was, because I was 34 years in the other place and always balloted when I was not in the Government, and never once drew a place in the draw.<lb/>
I was brought up to believe, in the words of the poet, that:
<quote>"In faith and hope the world may disagree</quote>
<quote>But all mankind's concern is charity."</quote>
There was an implication there that we would all be in agreement about charity and its purposes, and how they might he changed, and what might happen if they failed. But, alas, this short debate tonight has somehow disabused me of that ancient thought, and we have to accept that this is a difficult subject and strangely controversial, as I know from previous experience.<lb/>
I will, if I may, reply very briefly to my noble friend Lady Faithfull and my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway, each of whom said, in relation to the clock tower example I gave, "Ah, but if only we had neighbourhood trusts the problem could not arise." I beg to disagree with them, because the neighbourhood trust does have its limitations; not all trusts are suitable for bringing into a neighbourhood trust scheme, as the Charity Commissioners have already found on a number of occasions. Indeed, one can have isolated parishes such as were in my old constituency, where it is just not feasible to bring them into a neighbourhood trust&#x2014;small villages which have to stand on their own.
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0280"/>
<col>545</col>
I can well imagine that the provisions of this Bill would solve problems with which the trustees were frustratedly faced in such circumstances. So I am afraid I simply do not accept the view expressed on that quite relevant point.<lb/>
My Lords, the only other point I would make is this. On the face of it, the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, made a good point when he referred to the fact that the Goodman Committee attached a condition to the acceptance of its recommendation, the condition being that there should be local committees to supervise any changes that might be made. However, that does not invalidate the recommendation that they made that there should be something done about these very small trusts, and that is what the Bill seeks to achieve. I am deeply grateful, and I am sure that my right honourable friend Sir Angus Maude will also he grateful, to your Lordships, and in view of what has passed, I now beg leave to withdraw my Motion for Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-01982"><member>Lord Avebury</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01983">What decisions they have made on the recommendations in the Alvey Report under the heading "Human resources".</p>
<col>546</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01984"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member>: On 16th December 1982 my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science announced in another place a programme specifically designed to enhance education, training and retraining in Information Technology (IT).</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01985">The programme includes, for 1983&#2013;84, provision for 70 new university posts in IT, details of which were announced by the department on 12th April; 1,000 additional post graduate studentships in universities and polytechnics through the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC), primarily to enable graduates in subjects not directly related to IT to convert to that field; 45 SERC fellowships in the IT field; and an increase in the number of places for students taking relevant first degree, higher diploma and higher certificate courses by over 1,000. The announcement also mentioned right honourable friend's intention to make further increases in the following two years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01986">As to schools, Her Majesty's Government have recently announced an expansion of their micro-electronics education programme which has been a successful agent in establishing the effective use of microcomputers in schools. That programme, which is providing training materials for 50,000 teachers, is an essential complement to the Department of Industry's programme which aims to put a computer into every primary and secondary school in the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-01987">These measures go substantially beyond the recommendations of the Alvey Report. Together they should ensure that human resources are built up, strengthened and sustained, that manpower for the programme will be available and that the results of the programme can best he exploited to maximum national advantage.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02004"><member>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment (The Lord Bellwin)</member>: My right honourable friends the Secretaries of State for the Environment, for Energy, for Scotland and for Wales, have published our response to the CENE Coal Study today as a White Paper (<i>Coal and the Environment;</i> Cmnd. 8877). Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02005">We are grateful to the commission for their thorough analysis of the environmental effects of coal mining and use.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02006">We agree that a modern efficient coal industry, operated to high environmental standards, can make a major contribution to meeting the country's energy needs without imposing unacceptable invironmental costs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02007">We accept that spoil disposal, opencast extraction, and subsidence damage pose the main environmental challenge. But we agree with the commission the problems are not insuperable. Positive steps are being taken by the Government, the NCB, and local authorities to tackle them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02008">On spoil disposal, we have initiated a major exercise in the main Yorkshire Coalfield. This will evaluate the options, and establish a new framework within which decisions on spoil disposal can be taken.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02009">We intend to bring NCB opencast mining into the normal minerals planning system. This will enable local authorities to achieve a closer integration of land use planning and mining.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02010">We announce improved publicity by the NCB on possible subsidence, and publication of more comprehensive information about people's rights.

<quote>"Dear Leader of the House,</quote>
<quote>"It is my duty to request you to announce to the House that after consultation with yourself and the Lord Chancellor I have asked the Prime Minister to submit to Her Majesty The Queen my resignation from the office of Clerk of the Parliaments with effect from the beginning of the Summer Recess; and that Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to accept my resignation.</quote>
<quote>"I was appointed Clerk of the Parliaments in July 1974 and have now served nearly 9 years in that office. My appointment is not due to end till July 1987 but I should now like to retire and I am confident that the House will be well served by the Parliament Office after my retirement.</quote>
<quote>"I shall leave the House with regret. It has been a privilege to serve as Clerk of the Parliaments and I should be obliged if you would convey to the House my gratitude for the kindness and friendship which I have received from all sides of the House during my period of office.</quote>
Yours sincerely,
Peter Henderson."
My Lords, it is my further duty to notify your Lordships that The Queen has been pleased to appoint Mr. John Christopher Sainty to succeed Sir Peter Henderson from the beginning of the Summer Recess.<lb/>
Following that announcement it will, I am sure, be your Lordships' wish in due course to pay tributes to the services of Sir Peter Henderson in this House.</membercontribution></p>

In the ordinary course of events, I would have communicated this information to the Offices Committee before notifying the House but, due to the Dissolution of this Parliament, that has not proved to be possible and it has been agreed through the "usual channels" that I should make this announcement to the House at the earliest opportunity rather than waiting until the Offices Committee can be set up and a meeting arranged in the new Parliament, which would not be until some time early in July.<lb/>

The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, immediately following me, will announce his appointment to the vacancy at the Table consequential on Sir Peter's retirement, and I should like to say for myself and on the Lord Chancellor's behalf that extensive consultations have been held with representatives of all sides of the House over these important appointments. This is in accordance with undertakings given by my predecessors as Leader of the House and previous Lord Chancellors that appointments to the Table should be the subject of wide consultations, and these undertakings have on this occasion been honoured to the full. I should also report to the House that the result of those consultations was unanimous.</membercontribution></p>

There is indeed a United Nations force in the Lebanon, but this was not the one referred to in supplementary questions. The multinational force on which I was questioned is not a United Nations force. It was set up last year by agreement between the participating countries&#x2014;the United States, France and Italy&#x2014;and the Lebanese Government. A British contingent, a later addition to the force, is similarly in Lebanon under the terms of an exchange of letters with the Lebanese Government.<lb/>
There is no overall commander of the multinational force. Each contingent operates under national command. Political and military control of the British contingent is retained by Her Majesty's Government.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02024"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02025">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02026">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are in a position to make a statement concerning the outcome of the dispute between the British Airports Authority and certain airlines on the matter of landing charges and, if not, when they expect to be able to do so.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02027"><member>The Secretary of State for Trade (Lord Cockfield)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, following long and at times difficult negotiations, the American and other airlines which had taken legal proceedings over the Heathrow landing charges discontinued their action. They did this on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding and Settlement Agreement which, <i>inter alia,</i> set out the policies of the British Airports Authority on airport charges. The United States Government, which had initiated action under the Bermuda 2 Agreement, also discontinued their action on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding setting out Her Majesty's Government's policies.<lb/>
An announcement to this effect was made on 8th April. Copies of the documents are being placed in the Libraries of both Houses. I am glad that these matters, which have been the source of friction and have involved the expenditure of a great deal of time and effort, have been satisfactorily resolved in this way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02028"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while being glad that this three-year dispute has at last been brought to an end, may I ask the Minister whether what has been agreed includes the fact that in future the British Airports Authority will not rely so heavily on high landing charges to finance its capital expenditure? Secondly, has it also been agreed that in future there will be much closer collaboration among all airlines and the British Airports Authority on any fees levied by the authority?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02029"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may refer to the joint statement which was made by the parties when the actions were settled. It read as follows:
<quote>"Both sides now have a better understanding of each other's position and arrangements are being set in hand for improved collaboration and exchanges of information between the BAA and all its airline customers".</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02030"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the present Parliamentary Session ends tomorrow, may I ask whether the Minister realises how much I myself and the airlines have appreciated the manner in which
<col>552</col>
he has been prepared to look at well-documented cases? We appreciate the proper answers that we have had in this House and we should like to thank him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02031"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for what she says. She has herself played a major part in the progress which has been made on these various matters.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02033"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02034">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02035">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will introduce improved regulations to ensure that all goods in British shops are clearly marked with the name of their country of origin.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02036"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are reviewing the operation of the existing origin marking requirements, and will announce our conclusions as soon as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02037"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that there is now a desire by many individuals in Britain to do their best to create job opportunities and a demand for our goods? It would be very much easier to carry out individual wishes if we were able to discover where goods came from. The sooner this is made clear, the better for Britain's recovery in general.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02038"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note the point made by my noble friend, and I support his view that, wherever possible, people in this country prefer to buy British goods. In fact, we have greatly extended the scope of origin marking and we are considering what further extensions might be desirable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02039"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister consider whether there is any merit in introducing some form of financial incentive to produce origin markings?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02040"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a suggestion that goes rather wide. We are restricted in what we can do in this field by our obligations towards the Community and under international agreement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02041"><member>Baroness Fisher of Rednal</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord give consideration to the fact that many British names are put on commodities that are produced abroad and that people buy them in all good faith thinking that they are British made? I am speaking particularly about goods from some of our larger fashion houses that carry the British tag. One finds when one has taken one's purchase home that very often there is a small tag sewn into the seam of the article that says "Made in Hong Kong".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02042"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Trade Descriptions Act 1972 requires the origin marking of all imports which are supplied here under a United Kingdom name or mark.</membercontribution></p>

<title>"General Belgrano": President of Peru's<lb/> Alleged Statement</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02043">3.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02044"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02045">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02046">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have yet traced the published interview with the President of Peru concerning the sinking of the "Belgrano" and, if so, whether they propose to take any action.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02047"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Belstead)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has kindly sent me the text of an interview published by an Argentine magazine last January in which President Bela&#x00FA;nde described his efforts to assist a negotiated solution to the Falklands crisis during the first three weeks of May 1982. No action by Her Majesty's Government is called for.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02048"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord the Minister recall that on 20th April, when I asked him a similar Question, his Answer was to the effect that he had consulted the British Embassy in Lima and the Swiss section dealing with British affairs in Buenos Aires? Does he not agree that he would have saved the expenditure of this public money if he had walked down the corridor, where, at that time, there was in the Library of another place a copy of the interview to which I referred in the edition of <i>Siete Dias</i> for 26th January? Would he also agree that in his answer to my letter, in which I suggested that he had misled the House on this occasion, he has not in any way cast any doubt on the fact that the sinking of the "Belgrano" was coincidental with the peace negotiations led by Peru and that, in fact, his right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary was at that time discussing peace? Can he tell the House whether the Foreign Secretary was informed of the decision to sink the "Belgrano"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02049"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it was reasonable to infer from the noble Lord's Question on 20th April and from the summary that appeared in a British newspaper on 20th March that the noble Lord's interest was being expressed in a recent statement by President Belaunde rather than in a three-months-old press interview. The noble Lord says to the House that the sinking of the "Belgrano" and the mediation efforts by President Belaunde were coincidental. May-be they were; but the press report to which I now know the noble Lord is referring, which was published in Argentina, tells how the President of Peru continued active negotiations for more than two more weeks, says that the British agreed to listen to any proposal and records that those negotiations were finally ended by unilateral Argentine action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02050"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02051"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord tell the House whether the Foreign Secretary was informed of the decision to sink the "Belgrano" before
<col>554</col>
that decision was conveyed to the submarine commander?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02052"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the British Government had established the maritime exclusion zone on 12th April and had also warned, on 23rd April, that any approach by Argentine warships which could amount to a threat to British forces would encounter the appropriate response. There was therefore a possibility of action at any time against an Argentine warship disregarding those warnings. The position of my right honourable friend, therefore, does not come into the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02053"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if it is the case as the noble Minister has said, the British having said categorically that anything within the 200-mile radius of the fleet would suffer attack and the "Belgrano" being miles away from that 200-mile radius, who then gave the instruction to disobey that word of honour of the British public?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02054"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is ground which has been gone over many times before. The "General Belgrano" was kept in such a position by the Argentine authorities, despite warnings that Argentine warships which could pose a threat to British forces would be subject to attack.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02055"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the many Argentine casualties incurred by the sinking of the "Belgrano", would the Minister say what arrangements he would authorise for the visit by families of Argentine servicemen who were killed in the Falklands war to visit the graves there? Would the Minister not agree that, apart from the point of view of compassion and humanity, the lack of enthusiasm towards such a visit is a greater tool for propaganda in the hands of the Argentinians than would be a visit itself?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02056"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no lack of enthusiasm: but we are now getting on to a different question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02057"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend assure the House just once more&#x2014;not only because the contents of this Question have been shown to be false but because press reports have also carried the same innuendoes&#x2014;that the current allegations about the facts surrounding the sinking of the "Belgrano" have absolutely no foundation whatsoever?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02058"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I will do so. The "General Belgrano" was sunk solely for military reasons&#x2014;because she posed a threat to ships of the task force. The House should know that thorough investigation has shown that knowledge of the Peruvian proposals reached London only after the attack on the "General Belgrano". The record, of which I think all noble Lords are aware, shows quite clearly how hard we tried before and after that sinking to reach a negotiated settlement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02059"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although it may be the case that the electoral benefit derived by the Conservative Party from the sinking and subsequent victory are entirely coincidental, will not&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02062"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order, order&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02063"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it would be the wish of the House that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, should ask his supplementary question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02064"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is what I was trying to do. I was about to ask the noble Lord whether he would bear in mind, in relation to the supplementary question of my noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs, Winston Churchill's dictum, "In victory, magnanimity".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02065"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not only have we shown magnanimity in this matter but we have been ready to offer proper facilities; but, as the noble Lord knows, the arrangements were not accepted by those who were organising the visit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02066"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord is attempting to maintain his stand that the news of the Peruvian negotiations reached London and the Prime Minister, who took this decision, only after the sinking of the "Belgrano", how does he equate that with the statement of his right honourable friend the Foreign Minister, who, on arriving in Washington before the sinking of the "Belgrano", said that there was no intention to take any further military action? May I ask him whether he has seen the press reports referred to by his noble friend Lord Orr-Ewing, the BBC programme on 29th April and also the reports given by Mr. Paul Foot both in the <i>Daily Mirror</i> and in this week's <i>New Statesman,</i> which support the point that I have been trying to make to him?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02067"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am surprised that the noble Lord ascribes such a statement to my right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary at a time when the task force was steaming towards the Falkland Islands. So far as the rest of the noble Lord's supplementary question is concerned, I am very pleased to put the record absolutely clear. The first intimation that the Government had of the existence of any proposals from the President of Peru came in a series of conversations between Mr. Pym and Mr. Haig in Washington on 2nd May. The result of these conversations was telegraphed to London at 2215 GMT on 2nd May&#x2014;over three hours after the attack on the "General Belgrano".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02068"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am a very simple person and I have a simple question. If we had not sunk the Belgrano", would the "Belgrano" probably have sunk some of our ships?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02069"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to this question has been made clear by my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Armed Forces on 24th March and 2nd May. The answer to the noble Lord is that there were signs that our ships and men were threatened by a pincer attack, and that that involved the "General Belgrano".</membercontribution></p>

<title>Unemployment Statistics</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02070">3.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02071"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02072">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02073">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will state the reasons for the omission from the published "total unemployed" statistics of the figures relating to those who are unemployed and seeking work but who are not required to register for benefit.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02074"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the monthly unemployment figures refer to those people who are registered at unemployment offices for the purposes of benefit. Other job seekers can be identified by random household surveys but these are only estimates. Those surveys, however, indicate that there are people who are claiming benefit but who are not actively seeking work.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02075"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that despite the fact that unemployment is continuing to rise in the United Kingdom, and is predicted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer as likely to rise still further, the public figures&#x2014;upon which, at any rate, certain sections of the presss rely for their headlines&#x2014;show a downward trend due to what can only be described as a massaging of the figures? Is the noble Earl the Minister aware that the unemployment figures probably disclose something like 500,000 short of the true figure for unemployment based upon the old method of computation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02076"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am bound to say that I am shocked to hear the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, suggest that the figures have been massaged. The noble Lord knows perfectly well that that is not so. I explained in the original Answer that these figures which are obtained are statistical figures; therefore, they have their limitations. Those people who are approached during random samples have been shown not to be actively seeking work, but nevertheless claiming benefit. They may amount to some 400,000; equally there are those who do not claim benefit but who do seek work, and their number can be about the same, so those figures cancel each other out.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to the increase in unemployment, which we all regret. But may I just tell him this: in the last 12 months the United Kingdom figure for unemployment has increased by 13 per cent.; that for Italy by 19 per cent.; for the Netherlands 30 per cent.; for Germany 32 per cent.; and for Canada 35 per cent. So our record is not worse than that of the other countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02077"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend the Minister give us details of the figures of those who are in employment in the United Kingdom?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02078"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, 42 per cent. of the population of the United Kingdom are in work. A
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0286"/>
<col>557</col>
higher proportion of the population in work appears in the United Kingdom than in any other country in Europe, other than Luxembourg and Denmark.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02079"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I understand it, the policy of the Government is to enhance the employment possibility, but in their endeavours to do that they say that people aged over 60 who are unemployed shall not be counted in the figures. Therefore are we to understand that if they drop that to people aged over 20 who would be out of work then Britain's creation of unemployment would be as it was under the Labour Government&#x2014;full employment? Is that the absurdity of what ordinary people understand, with this callous act of the Government being nothing but a con trick?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02080"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can only say I am surprised at the noble Lord's use of language&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02081"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: Tell that to the unemployed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02082"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, will be good enough not to make interventions from a sedentary position but will enable me to answer the question, that will be a help. The noble Lord knows perfectly well that those over 60 used to have to register for national insurance credits and they were therefore added to the unemployment figure even though they may have been retired with pension. Now they do not have to do this and therefore that particular figure has been removed from the unemployment statistics.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02083"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl the Minister aware that the expression used by the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, "con trick", is undoubtedly an offence under Standing Order No. 29 as to asperity, and he should be asked to withdraw it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02084"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Hear, hear. Withdraw&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02085"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl the Minister aware that at paragraph 11 of the Department of Employment press notice issued on the 6th May, the department refers to the fact that certain provisions are made in the Budget, and that from April under the first provision men aged 60 or over no longer have to sign on at an unemployment benefit office to secure national insurance credit? As a result, it has been estimated that some 90,000 men may no longer have to sign on. Is the noble Earl aware that <i>The Times,</i> in its feature on this subject on 9th May, referred to the fact that this amount will be reflected in the next unemployment figures&#x2014;published, oddly enough, on the 3rd June, six days before the general election? Does the noble Earl think that it is right to mislead the electorate at large by causing it to be presented four days before the poll with figures that do not reflect the accurate position?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02086"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I really think that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, if I may say so with respect, is making a mountain out of a molehill. The changes in the coverage of the figures simply follow changes in administrative procedures which we have made easier for unemployed people. The effects of
<col>558</col>
these changes on the unemployment count are monitored openly and are fully displayed. The figure to which the noble Lord referred is the fact that in April the count was reduced by 26,400 because of men aged 60 and over moving to automatic national insurance credits&#x2014;not 90,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02087"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that the Government are perhaps making a molehill out of a mountain?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02088"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if by that the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, means that we are not taking unemployment seriously, perhaps I can just tell him that the Government are spending some &#x00A3;2,000 million this year on helping the training of people under the special employment and training measures. That is a very substantial figure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02089"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl the Minister aware that the figure of 90,000 which he has challenged is taken from the press release of the Department of Employment itself&#x2014;paragraph 11, on page 8? Is the noble Earl further aware that the figure I gave to the House was therefore quite correct?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02090"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the figure I gave to the noble Lord referred to the figure I thought he was asking for&#x2014;the number of people aged 60 with a pension who now do not have to call and be registered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02091"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, April figures.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02092"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl the Minister gave certain details of the rise in unemployment in certain countries. Will he confirm that France, with its Socialist Government, has succeeded in slightly reducing the number of unemployed in that country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02093"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, that France has a smaller proportion of its people employed than in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the figure is 42 per cent.; in France it is only 40 per cent. If the inference of her question is that the conditions of the French Government are better than in England, I think the noble Baroness wants to have a look at what is happening in France at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02094"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is there not another vital difference&#x2014;that we have more sea oil and they have not?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02095"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a fascinating difference but nothing whatever to do, with the greatest respect, with the question which is on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02122"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments No. 1 to 6 <i>en</i> bloc. At the same time I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 14 to 19, 27 and 28, 30 to 33, 40 to 47, 49, 63, 66 to 69, 71 to 77, 79 to 83, 85, to 92 and 94 to 96. The first of these amendments relates to the functions and constitutions of the four boards of trustees. Perhaps I could highlight those which may be of greatest interest to the House. The Government have added to the Bill amendments designed to ensure that all or some of the boards specifically have powers to carry out particular functions. This group includes powers to establish trading companies (Amendments Nos. 6, 19 and 49); powers to let premises for purposes not connected with their functions (Amendments Nos. 5 and 18); and a power for the Minister to direct that the board shall undertake functions on his behalf. This last replaces narrower powers in the original Bill and is intended to ensure that the V and A and Science Museums can continue to administer the local purchase grants scheme if required. We have also clarified the board's functions in respect of their
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0288"/>
<col>561</col>
educational role and their powers to charge for services or goods provided by them.<lb/>
Further groups of amendments are concerned with Schedule 1. These widen the fields of expertise to which the appropriate Minister of the Crown shall have regard when appointing trustees, raise the minimum size of the quorum in most boards, give an explicit power to pay allowances in respect of loss of earnings for trustees and committee members; provide a duty to report on the introduction of any admission charges, together with any exemptions, and provide the boards with the privileges, immunities and exemptions enjoyed by a Minister when they are exercising functions on his behalf.<lb/>
There are also a number of what might be best described as technical amendments concerned with the accounting provisions changing the reference from "property" to "land" and the substitution for "craft" for "the crafts" and "understanding" for "knowledge" in Clauses 2, 9 and 16 and paragraph 3(3) of Schedule 1.<lb/>
I should like also to bring to your attention a series of printing errors in some amendments in this group. On page 4, Amendment 19, subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) line 1, the first "or" should read "of". On page 5, Amendment 19, subsection (2)(<i>d</i>), line 3, after "occupied" insert "or managed". On page 9, Amendment 49, subsection (2) (<i>b</i>), "plans" should read "plants". Page 13, Amendment No. 63, (<i>b</i>) should read (6). Page 16, Amendment 90, para. 32, line 2, the second "as" should read "or". Page 17, Amendment No. 97, subsection (8), line 4, after "lie" insert "except". I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02128"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 <i>en bloc</i> and at the same time speak to Amendments Nos. 10 to 13, 20 and 21, 23 to 26, 29, 34 and 34A, 36 to 39, 48 and 50 to 53. There is also one correction in this block of
<col>562</col>
amendments which is on page 5, Amendment No. 20&#x2014;page 2 should read page 8.<lb/>
As we stressed when we took the Bill through this House, in drafting the Bill we have been very concerned to ensure that the rights of third parties remain unaffected. Thus, Clause 3(4) provides that any rights and liabilities which a Secretary of State has or to which he is subject because of his ownership of the objects in the collections are transferred to the board along with the objects. If an object is subject to a trust or condition now, it will remain so in the hands of the board. We have further sought to ensure that rights under trusts or conditions would be respected by including the express declaration which was contained in Clause 2(6) of a previous print of the Bill.<lb/>
On further reflection, we now think that the subsection is unnecessary and may in fact positively threaten third party rights in other respects. The subsection is unnecessary because it amounts to no more than the proposition that the board should observe the law: in other words, it is stating the obvious. It is well established in law that where legislation creates a statutory corporation (which the board will be) it does not empower the corporation to disregard the law, unless the clearest of words are used. Without Clause 2(6) there is no question that the board will be able to override trusts and conditions. The new Clause 5(3) is designed to emphasise still more clearly than its predecessor that the board may not dispose of any object in breach of trust or condition except in the very limited circumstances prescribed in paragraph (<i>d</i>).<lb/>
The amended Clause 5(5) makes it possible for the boards to override trusts and conditions in the disposal of objects only where an object is useless for the purposes of the board's collections by reason of damage, physical deterioration or infestation by destructive organisms. By stipulating that trusts and conditions may be overridden only in these circumstances there can be no question that in the case of all other disposals, whether by sale, exchange or gift, the trust and conditions must be observed.<lb/>
So far as lending is concerned, the new provisions vary slightly from those previously in the Bill, in that they make it plain that it is the person who originally imposed the restriction or his personal representatives whose consent is required to the loan of an object and not the person or personal representatives of the person who donated or bequeathed the object to the museum. In many cases this person and the person who imposed the condition will be one and the same, but it is possible to imagine gifts or bequests of objects already subject to a condition imposed by another. In these circumstances we think it right that the person who orginally set up the restriction should be the one to lift the restriction and not the ultimate donor.<lb/>
The Government believe that there is a distinction to be drawn in the case of provisions affecting the board's powers to make loans between trusts and conditions. In the case of the latter, the donor of an object which is subject to a condition may be entitled to the return of that object should the condition be breached. These amendments are not intended to alter in any way the basic premise underlying the provisions

of the Bill: the trust and conditions attaching to objects must be observed. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02131" align="center"><b>COMMONS AMENDMENT</b></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02134"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 9. I should also like to speak to Amendments Nos. 22, 35, 189, 191 to 197 and 199. These amendments were tabled in response to a commitment which I gave to the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, on Report and again on Third Reading. They deal with points which were also raised in Committee in another place. These amendments add the Boards of the Armouries, the British Museum (Natural History) and the British Library to the list of bodies set out in Schedule 1 to the National Gallery and Tate Gallery Act 1954.<lb/>
Schedule 1 to the 1954 Act serves two purposes. First, it names the institutions other than the National and Tate galleries to which the Secretary of State may direct works of art left to the nation without specific direction being made. The National and Tate galleries are covered by specific provisions elsewhere in that Act. There are good reasons why these three institutions should also be able to benefit from such directions. The British Library is the foremost library in the nation and, since the National Libraries of both Wales and Scotland are already included, it is right that the British Library should also be named. Of course, the British Library did not exist as a separate entity in 1954 and the Act of 1972 establishing the Library did not include appropriate provisions.<lb/>
The omission of the British Museum (Natural History) came about for similar reasons. The British Museum Act 1963 established the Natural History Museum as a separate entity, but made no provision to add the new body to the Schedule to the 1954 Act. In our view, the Tower Armouries should also be added, since it is right that they should be able to benefit in the same way as the other trustee museums and galleries in appropriate instances. The list in the 1954 schedule serves an additional purpose; it represents those national institutions to whom the Tate Gallery may transfer objects.<lb/>
Similar reference to the schedule was made in some subsequent museums legislation but not all, and the transfer provisions in those Acts vary. Taken with the effect of transfer provisions in legislation prior to 1954, there is no fully reciprocal system. This is not as bad as it sounds, because in most cases the essential relationships between particular institutions are covered in one way or another.<lb/>
These amendments fill some of the more serious gaps involving the British Museum and the British Library. Further, by adding those institutions to Schedule 1 to the 1954 Act with the British Museum
<col>564</col>
(Natural History) and the Armouries, we enable those institutions to receive relevant objects by transfer from those other national institutions empowered to do so. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Strabolgi, will agree that these amendments meet the substance of his own amendments earlier, and I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02135">Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Avon.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02136"><member>Lord Strabolgi</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Avon, for explaining the purpose of these amendments which, as he said, are based on amendments that I moved during Report and Third Reading stages when the Bill came before your Lordships' House. During the passage of the Bill through this House, where it started, it came to light that there were certain defects in the drafting of the British Museum Act, the National Gallery and Tate Gallery Act, and that other Acts relating to the transfer of objects between our national museums were out of date and should have been updated, as the noble Earl said, to take account of institutions such as the British Library which have come into effect since those Acts became law. Therefore, it seemed to us that it was important that this Bill should be seen as an opportunity to tidy up this legislation. The Government accepted that in principle in this House, and we are very grateful to them for the fact that they have made these amendments in the other place. Particularly on the 20th anniversary of the British Museum Act 1963, it is important that this defect should have been put right. We are very grateful.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02216"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 55 to 58 <i>en bloc.</i> At the same time, I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 60 to 63, 65, 99 to 101, 103 to 113, 115 to 125, 133, 137, 143 and 144, 146 to 148, 150 and 151, 153, 156, 158 to 185, 187 and 187A. This group of amendments deals with various aspects of the commission's functions. Some of them are simply tidying up amendments, such as those about consultation requirements or clarifying the position of monuments or buildings which straddle the English border. Others, however, may be of particular interest to this House being matters which occasioned much discussion at earlier stages. For example, Amendment No. 58 contains a revised power for the commission to form trading companies. It will allow a subsidiary to have wider objects and hence to undertake a wider range of presentational and promotional activities. I hope that it will be welcomed here, as it was in another place.<lb/>
The House may also have noticed Amendment No. 101, which is an amended version of a provision about local government knowledge or experience among commissioners, which was inserted in this House on Report. The Government believe that, by redrafting it slightly and placing it in a separate sub-paragraph, we have managed to express the same intention without the ambiguity of the original. Similarly, Amendment No. 125 provides an amended register of gardens provision which we have brought forward for largely legal reasons. I hope that, in the light of the Government's acceptance of the principles behind these provisions, the redrafting is acceptable.<lb/>
Amendment No. 105 is again a tidied-up version of an amendment which was finally voted into the Bill in another place, which requires the commision to set up a committee on ancient monuments and one on historic buildings, as well as enabling them to set up other committees. We believe that our version brings out more clearly the desired intention and I hope that the House will give it their support. Noble Lords may also be glad to see Amendment No. 184, which enables the commission to make grants to the Architectural Heritage Fund. This will provide an additional way for the commission to channel funds through the AHF to local trusts which operate revolving funds.<lb/>
One amendment which needs some explanation is Amendment No. 181, which deletes the words "or building" which were added by this House in Committee. The intention was to clarify the commission's
<col>570</col>
powers to undertake or pay for archaeological investigations of buildings as well as land. However, the House may recall that in the 1979 Act, where these powers are to be found, the word "land" is clearly defined as including a building or monument, so not only is the addition of "or building" unnecessary but in legal terms&#x2014;this is the important point&#x2014;it would imply that "land" does not include "building". So if we leave things as they are, there will be two definitions of "land", one explicitly including buildings and monuments, the other implicitly excluding buildings. This would be highly confusing. After a great deal of consideration the Government have concluded therefore that because these words could have a most unfortunate effect on the interpretation of other parts of the 1979 Act they would best be deleted.<lb/>
Lastly, there are the garden amendments; namely, Amendments Nos. 119, 121 and 124. A great deal of pressure was exerted on the Government by this House to extend the commission's powers in this way and we have acceded. Under these amendments, the commission will be able to acquire gardens or other lands of outstanding historic interest, to accept endowments in respect of those acquisitions and to assist the National Trust in those acquisitions. In addition, Amendment No. 119 will allow the commission to acquire and dispose of any buildings in conservation areas which appear to them to be of special historic or architectural interest. This will enable the commission to operate a revolving fund in respect of such buildings as well as outstanding historic buildings.<lb/>
I have briefly outlined some of the most notable amendments. The others are no less important in ensuring that the commission have the full range of powers and duties which they will need to operate effectively. Again I have to draw the attention of the House to some of the corrections of printing errors. On page 13, Amendment No. 61, "(<i>a</i>)" should read ""(<i>a</i>)"". On page 27, Amendment No. 180, subsection (5), line 3, "operation" should read "operations". On page 21, Amendment No. 124, subsection (1), line 2, after "so" insert "and". On page 28, Amendment No. 187A, line 2, "67A" should read "63A". Subsection (2) ought to read "Sub-paragraph (2)" and we delete (<i>c</i>). Line 4 should read line 6. After "redundancy" insert "scheme". On page 29, Amendment No. 187A, line 4, after "part" insert "with". On page 30, Amendment No. 187A, subparagraph (10), line 5, after "any" insert "other". I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

welcome the amendments which give to the commission full commercial powers and full freedom, in particular the recognition of gardens which are such an important part of our heritage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02221"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I support what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, particularly about the wider trading powers. At Third Reading, I remember that we said we wanted these trading powers to be expanded in the way that they now are, so this is a great improvement. I am delighted, turning to Amendment No. 101, that local government has been included. We spent some time on this matter. Many of us were anxious that a representative of local government should be on the face of the Bill. That is now so. Turning to Amendment No. 100 and the exemption of the commission from controls, could the Minister tell me whether under this or any other legislation there is any procedure&#x2014;non-statutory, if necessary&#x2014;whereby national amenity societies or other bodies are able to call into question any excess of zeal which they think the commission have displayed over, for example, restoring an ancient building, if they feel the commission may be destroying, with good intentions, nevertheless, the very thing they are seeking to preserve by doing too much? Is no public inquiry procedure to be available to the Secretary of State so that such matters can be argued in public, as they should be? I doubt whether this would happen very frequently. I should have given notice to the Minister of this question if I had thought sooner about this point.<lb/>
So far as this group of amendments is concerned, may I also draw attention to Amendment No. 105, about which we are very pleased. We had quite a full discussion in this House on the setting up of two committees, one covering ancient monuments and the other historic buildings. I am delighted that they are now included in the Bill. I am also very pleased that there is to be an extension of the powers to grant aid to the National Trust. Again that is a matter which we discussed in this House. I know that it will give great pleasure not only to the National Trust but also to the amenity societies which have been extremely helpful throughout the passage of the Bill. I am pleased about Amendment No. 125, which deals with the rewording of the register of gardens. When we originally pressed for it in this House the Government were rather doubtful about it, but now that they have reworded the register everybody is entirely happy. The garden amendments are greatly welcomed generally. That covers most of the points. The only one about which I have a query is Amendment No. 100.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02222"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not absolutely sure that I correctly followed the noble Baroness in her query, but I shall give a response now and if I find that I am incorrect perhaps I may contact her later. The answer to her problem is that if the Government set up a body to be expert in a certain field we trust it to act appropriately. There will always be disagreement between experts on issues where a decision has to rest on interpretive judgment. This does not mean that either expert is wrong. The Government are convinced that the commission will act sensibly and sensitively
<col>572</col>
and that they will listen to others in the field who are concerned and knowledgeable. Where a proposal was giving rise to public concern, or was likely to do so, I believe that the commission would be well advised to give their intentions a public airing in some appropriate form. That is a course which the Government would certainly wish to encourage the commission to consider in appropriate circumstances. If I have not followed the noble Baroness correctly, perhaps she will allow me to write to her on the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02223"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. I had taken it a stage further&#x2014;to being able to set up a public inquiry. However, the indication which the Minister has given will be understood by the new commission. If, however, the Minister finds that what I have said has been covered, or could be covered in the future, perhaps he will write to me about it. I do not propose at this stage to hold up the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

These amendments provide that, in the event of a dispute, the complaint must be referred to the tribunal within three months of the date of the offer or, in exceptional cases, within such period as the tribunal considers reasonable in the circumstances. This will ensure that any such disputes (and we hope there will be none) will be settled promptly. I am sure that the House will agree with these amendments. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<col>586</col>
speaking also to Amendments Nos. 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27 and 28. These new clauses and the consequential amendments will replace the system of written agreements on which the Bill was previously based with a combination of implied terms and express terms. The Bill has been amended quite substantially since it left your Lordships' House&#x2014;largely in the light of views expressed during the Bill's passage through your Lordships' House. It was a good Bill when it left, but I believe your Lordships will agree that it is an even better Bill now.<lb/>
After extensive consultations these new clauses were introduced. They oblige the site owner to provide a resident with a written statement setting out the implied terms and the express terms of his agreement with the resident. The express terms are those which the site owner and the resident have agreed between them; that is, upon subjects not covered by the implied terms. Either the resident or the site owner may then apply to the court within six months of the date on which the written statement is provided to ask that any of the express terms be varied or deleted from the agreement, or to ask that terms concerning the subjects listed in Part II of Schedule 1 shall be added to the agreement. The written statement will also have to comply with regulations made by the Secretary of State.<lb/>
Those are the bare bones of the approach set out in the new clauses and amendments. We have accepted that an element of implied terms will further strengthen the protection which the Bill provides to residents. We have, however, been careful to limit the scope of the implied terms to those subjects which need to be covered by them&#x2014;and it would not be fair or reasonable to push the balance of the Bill too far against the site owner. This new approach will leave them free to negotiate with their residents on a local basis those matters that should be negotiated locally, such as pitch fees or the services the site owner will provide, and on the details of the resident's obligations.<lb/>
At the same time, the written statement which the site owner must provide will set out all the terms of the agreement between the site owner and the resident, so that both sides may know the basis of their relationship. In that respect, we believe that the written statement will serve much the same purpose as the written agreement in the existing Bill. The Bill will make a significant difference to the lives of many people&#x2014;about 160,000 in England, Scotland and Wales&#x2014;who live on mobile home sites. The Bill retains a fair balance between site owner and resident.<lb/>

<col>587</col>
the amendments which are before the House, and I understand that a number of other amendments are being taken with the main amendment. I should like also to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, at this stage of the Bill, which has previously and quite ably been dealt with by his noble friend Lord Bellwin. During the various stages of this Bill noble Lords of all parties have pressed for changes which will give greater protection to mobile home occupiers and to clarify the situation for site owners, so that everyone will know where they stand.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, said&#x2014;and I know that his noble friend Lord Lucas of Chilworth will agree&#x2014;that it is important to achieve a balance between the parties. We made the point earlier that those people who are mobile home occupiers do not, for a very good reason, have the help of solicitors and legal advisers, possibly, although I believe that they in fact need that kind of help on occasions. They are, after all, making a very substantial investment, often equal to that made by those in other forms of housing. Therefore, the Bill needs to give the kind of clarification which has been introduced in another place and which your Lordships are being asked to endorse today.<lb/>
There have been some substantial changes made to the Bill in another place. Before making these changes the Government consulted the various interests and bodies concerned, including the National Federation of Site Operators, the National Caravan Council, the Mobile Home Residents' Association, local authorities, the National Consumer Council and others. The Government should be thanked for the agreement they have reached on this matter with members of all parties in order to achieve the changes which have been brought about. I believe the balance is fairer now. It would be unjust to imply that most site owners are not good site landlords, but we have to acknowledge the concern of everyone involved that good facilities should be provided in order to create a harmonious environment. This is greatly helped by the Bill being drafted in such a way, with implied terms and the other concessions to which the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, has made reference. All this will help towards the proper working of the legislation.<lb/>
With those few words, I should like to express the appreciation of my noble friends, and indeed those of other parties in our team of people, who will speak for themselves anyway, in saying that we welcome the changes. There are aspects, to which I might make reference later, which we should have liked to have seen in the Bill, but at this stage we welcome the amendments which have been moved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02468"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we, too, would welcome the amendments, which followed the discussions we had in this House; and we are very pleased to know that the Government gave further consideration to what was said by your Lordships. A solution has been reached which we think is beneficial both to the residents of mobile homes and to the site operators in clarifying the agreements that will be made between them and in ensuring that the number of disputes following the passing of this Act will be brought down to a minimum. We are very grateful to the noble Lord for explaining these amendments, which have been made in another place.<lb/>
<col>588</col>
There is just one point on which I should like to ask the noble Lord's advice, and that is why the particulars of agreements have to be notified to the occupier within three months of the making of an agreement where the agreement is arrived at after the passing of the Act, whereas if the agreement was arrived at before the coming into force of the Act the site operator is given six months to supply that written statement. This was not something we had in the original Clause 1. I wonder whether the noble Lord the Minister could explain that. I am sure there is a good reason for it. In general, we share the welcome which has been expressed by other noble Lords and the noble Baroness to these new clauses and amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02469"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend Lady Trumpington, the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for their welcome to these amendments. I very much regret that I am not able to satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, this afternoon on the question of the varying periods of time allowed as between future agreements and those that were in force or might have been in force under the terms of the 1975 Act, which now, on the passing of this Bill, will automatically obtain for those people who have agreements on mobile homes sites. I think it is largely a matter of administrative detail. Perhaps I could set out separately, in a day or two, the exact implications of those periods which the noble Lord mentioned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02474"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 15 and 16. The Government have on this occasion taken the unusual step of proposing to Parliament that the Bill should come into force only one week after Royal Assent. This is in order to minimise the danger that site owners might attempt to deny their residents the protection of the Bill by taking action before the Bill comes into force. In parenthesis, I think that perhaps this is in part the answer to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, because those who never had an agreement at all under the 1975 Act, or, indeed, those who might well have had an agreement under the 1975 Act, would find that had they exercised their options&#x2014;originally, the minimium period was five years, and there was an option of a further three years&#x2014;it would be this year, in a matter of weeks only, that those options would run out. I think this is in part the answer that the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was seeking.<lb/>
The Bill is in its final stages. I do not think it is unduly premature to say that it is Parliament's wish that mobile home residents should enjoy the protection that the Bill will provide. These amendments will reduce as far as is possible the danger that site owners will be able to prevent that happening between now and commencement. Therefore, subject to the approval of your Lordships' House, we hope it will be
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0302"/>
<col>589</col>
possible for the Bill to receive Royal Assent and come into force before the end of May. Any resident who is still on a mobile home site, provided his right to be there has not already been brought to an end by then, will, as I have said, be entitled to the protection of the Bill from its commencement date. From that date residents will have security of tenure and a right to sell on site.<lb/>
I should perhaps add that the Caravan Sites Act 1968 provides that a notice to determine a residential contract on a mobile home site cannot take effect in less than 28 days. These amendments, therefore, bring the Bill into force one week after Royal Assent. Normally, of course, we would expect a period of perhaps two months, but if the rights which the Bill provides are to be available to as many people as possible, and if it is to be effective in protecting those it is designed to protect, we must do what we can to limit the ability of a site owner to avoid that obligation. That means bringing the Bill into force just one week after Royal Assent, as these two amendments in fact will.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02476"><member>Baroness Fisher of Rednal</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on this side would thank the noble Lord for the information he has given. We feel that the one week after Royal Assent provision is really the very best thing the Government can do, because that has tightened the loophole completely. As the noble Lord rightly said, if it had gone on for three months there might have been harassment on some of the sites, knowing that the Bill was coming into operation. So that final closing of a loophole is something for which we would commend the Government.<lb/>
While I am on my feet, may I also say that we are very much indebted to the Government for trying to put the Bill into plain English, as we asked them to do. We know it is difficult to put it into plain English, but they have really tried, and for that we compliment them.</membercontribution></p>

They have a great deal to commend them. I believe that there might have been one or two unscrupulous site operators&#x2014;no more&#x2014;who would have attempted to take advantage of a three-month gap had it been left in the Bill. I am sure there will be no corresponding disadvantage, bearing in mind that everybody has known that the Bill is on its way since your Lordships first began to consider it at the beginning of December last year. One hopes that both site operators and residents will have been thinking about the making of the agreements into which they will now be able to enter, and that no-one will feel pressured as a result of the reduction from three months to one week. We are grateful to the Government for these amendments. We think this is commonsense and will be beneficial to both sides.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02492"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 19. Without this amendment the Bill would allow a site owner to terminate an agreement on the ground that the resident has breached its terms and, after receiving notice to remedy the breach, has not done so within a reasonable time. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the site owner to terminate an agreement on this ground only after an application to the court, and to give the court discretion in deciding whether to grant the application.<lb/>
The amendment is concerned with the site owner's ability to terminate the agreement. The court must be satisfied that the resident has breached the agreement, that he has been served with a proper notice to remedy the breach and has failed to comply with that notice within a reasonable time. Taken together with other procedures for termination of agreements contained in the Bill, this amendment ensures that such an agreement to which the Bill applies can be brought to an end only with the consent of a court. It will be the site owner who terminates the agreement rather than the court, but he will need the court's approval.<lb/>
This was another issue raised in the consultation letter that was issued after the Committee stage in another place. Certainly none of those who responded to that consultation letter was opposed to this requirement that the site owner must go to court. We have also accepted that it would be right to allow the court to decide whether or not it was reasonable that it should grant an application for termination. Without that discretion the court might find itself constrained
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0303"/>
<col>591</col>
to terminate an agreement for trivial reasons. However, the court will not be able to suspend the site owner's right to terminate. Once the application has been granted he can terminate the agreement forthwith. This amendment is a valuable addition to the protection which the Bill provides for residents, but it will not disadvantage responsible site owners.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02494"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we welcome this amendment as an improvement to the Bill, as the Minister has said. It gives greater protection and it improves the previous situation where the site owner himself could terminate an agreement, whereas now the court will have to do so. That appears to be a much greater concession than is actually the case, because the definition of "the court" in Clause 5(<i>a</i>) states:
<quote>"in relation to England and Wales, the county court for the district in which the protected site is situated or, where the parties have agreed in writing to submit any question arising under this Act or, as the case may be, any agreement made under it to arbitration, the arbitrator;</quote>
and in Scotland it will be the arbiter.<lb/>
As we have said at previous stages of the Bill in your Lordships' House, we all have great confidence in the courts as we know them&#x2014;the county courts and other forms of court&#x2014;but when an arbitrator has to be agreed between the two parties concerned, the site owner and the mobile home occupier, it can be anyone who is acceptable to both parties. In that situation we feel that the mobile home occupier is at a disadvantage because the site owner can put forward anyone, suggesting that the arbitrator who is recommended is impartial or, indeed, is well fitted in all these matters to deal adequately with the situation. It could well be&#x2014;and I think I used the term previously&#x2014;a friend of the family, the greengrocer or anyone else who happens to be agreed between the two parties. We do not think that is satisfactory.<lb/>
If the arbitrator, who can be someone with little or no experience of these important matters, can agree to a termination when acting as a court, there is not the security for which I am sure we all wish. It means that the occupiers are still generally worse off than owner-occupiers of ordinary homes and the tenants of public and private dwellings. I know that the Minister, and particularly the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, in the earlier stages of the Bill, did not seem happy about rent officers and others being brought in to help. My noble friends and I tabled an amendment to recommend that an arbitrator should be appointed after consultation with the president of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, for instance, or the rent officer, whose experience and background is accepted on all sides as being proper and adequate. But here in Clause 5 "the court" can be an arbitrator, and that is far from being as satisfactory as we would wish. However, having said that, we appreciate the improvement which has been put forward and agreed, and which the Government are recommending to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02495"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think perhaps it might be your Lordships' wish if I further commented on this question of arbitration. I know that it has
<col>592</col>
caused the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, and other noble Lords some concern. I am sorry that he still feels this concern.<lb/>
The Bill provides for the choice of an arbitrator to be freely made by both parties. If there is concern that an unscrupulous site owner might persuade a resident to accept an arbitrator who is perhaps anything other than impartial&#x2014;perhaps his brother-in-law, his agent or some other person; I am sure the noble Lord opposite bears no to greengrocers in the High Street&#x2014;the resident has the opportunity to agree or disagree.<lb/>
The Government will be producing a booklet in the housing booklet series to explain this new legislation and to replace the existing mobile homes booklet. The booklet will be available free from council offices, from housing aid centres and also from the Department of the Environment. It will be produced very soon after Royal Assent of this Bill, and we hope that it will be available in a very few weeks' time&#x2014;certainly well before residents will need to decide what action to take with regard to the written statement they receive from the site owner. Your Lordships will recall that it is obligatory upon the site owner to provide such a statement. The booklet will set out exactly what rights the owner-occupier has with regard to owner-occupation and the use of an arbitrator.<lb/>
Additionally, in considering this matter we felt that we were talking here not of small sums of money but certainly of smaller sums than one might envisage with the more traditional type of house; perhaps a mobile home of up to, say, &#x00A3;25,000, but more likely between &#x00A3;10,000 and &#x00A3;15,000. To enlist the aid of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors would undoubtedly cost considerably more money than going to other sources of arbitration. Provided that both parties understand exactly what the arbitrator is to do, we can see no great difficulty.<lb/>
In addition, even where the resident&#x2014;the owner-occupier&#x2014;agrees to the appointment of an arbitrator whom he knows to be related to or in some other way concerned with the site owner, the Arbitration Act 1950 still allows him to go to court to have the appointment revoked. If the resident does not find out about the relationship between the arbitrator and the site owner until the arbitrator has made his judgment, it will still be open to the owner-occupier to go to court to have that judgment set aside on the grounds that the arbitrator was biased. It simply is not the case that the resident is unprotected against the appointment of a biased arbitrator. As noble Lords will readily recognise, arbitrators may offer a much quicker and simpler method of resolving disputes than perhaps the courts. I believe that the alternative that is provided in the Bill should really meet all reasonable expectations of an arbitration service in a matter of this kind.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02510"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 26. These amendments strengthen the position of residents who wish to sell their mobile home. The amendments remove the obligation on owner-occupiers&#x2014;residents&#x2014;to give site owners first refusal on the sale of a mobile home. This series of amendments follows an undertaking given by my noble friend Lord Bellwin during the course of the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House and is largely the result of further consideration of arguments which were put by noble Lords in this House on the occasion.<lb/>
Noble Lords will be aware that it is on the question of sales that the worst abuses on mobile home sites are said to have taken place. These alleged abuses have arisen in cases where occupiers were not protected at all by any legislation&#x2014;where, in fact, they did not have agreements under the 1975 Act. Many owner-occupiers fell into that category. Nonetheless, there can be no doubt that the right of first refusal, which the 1975 Act gave to site owners and which the initial wording of the Bill retains, puts site owners in an unusually strong position when a mobile home is to be sold. If the site owner wants to buy the mobile home himself, and he has the right of first refusal, his bargaining position is both exceptional and, we now accept, excessive.<lb/>
My right honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State therefore introduced these amendments in another place to remove the right of first refusal. These amendments will not unduly weaken the position of site owners. There will be nothing to stop a site owner buying the mobile home himself if he wishes to do so. However, he will be in competition with other potential buyers; but, of course, he has the advantage that no commission will be payable on the price he pays for the mobile home, as it would be if someone else bought it. He can make an offer at a price reduced by the amount of commission that he would receive if the home was sold to a third party&#x2014;in effect, at a discount.<lb/>
The site owner will also have the right to approve a
<col>594</col>
potential purchaser, and that approval is not to be unreasonably withheld. But unscrupulous site owners will be unable to misuse the right of first refusal by forcing occupiers who wish to sell to accept an unfairly low price.<lb/>
My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State also announced that the Government would fix the maximum level of commission a site owner can charge on a sale at 10 per cent. This would be by order following Royal Assent. This 10 per cent. compares with the maximum of 15 per cent. fixed by another Administration in 1976 for sales under the 1975 Act, and it follows a consultation paper on the level of commission which my noble friend announced on the Second Reading of the Bill in this House on 18th November.<lb/>
In removing the right of first refusal and proposing a maximum of 10 per cent. commission, the Government have put together a package that will significantly improve the position of residents, but will certainly not drive site owners out of business. Here, as elsewhere in the Bill, the intention has been to keep a balance between site owners and residents, and to create a framework that will enable this way of life to flourish and develop in the future. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02512"><member>Lord Bishopston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I am pleased to say that we welcome the amendments moved by the noble Lord. Once again, they help the Bill. One of the main concerns about the need for a Bill at all was the fact that mobile home occupiers do not normally have the kind of security which those living in other forms of accommodation almost take for granted. They are not covered by the legislation which covers others. Concern arose over the situation of, for example, elderly people wanting other accommodation or young people with families wanting other accommodation. When it came to the time for sale of the home we all realised the problem of getting another site or selling to someone who has planning permission to go elsewhere. In many cases that is virtually impossible. Having to give the site owner first option to buy at a much lower price of course represents a very big loss on the investment made by those concerned. We certainly welcome the abolition of the site owner's right of first refusal and the reduction of the commission to 10 per cent. I think many of us would like to have seen the commission on sale abolished altogether.<lb/>
As I say, these are aspects which we welcome and they give more protection to the mobile home occupier, without being unduly unfair to the site owner. As the noble Lord has said, and as his noble friend Lord Bellwin said previously, it is a matter of keeping a balance between the interests of the two parties. I think that these amendments go some way towards doing that.<lb/>
This is probably the last amendment on which I shall speak before the Bill goes on its way to the statute book. Therefore, on behalf of myself and my noble friends and, indeed, others with whom we worked in your Lordships' House, I should like to express our
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0305"/>
<col>595</col>
thanks to the Government and others for their co-operation in getting the Bill through in this much more pleasing way due to their willingness to listen to the views of all concerned.<lb/>
I also think that a tribute should be paid to the members of the National Consumer Council for their work in advising Members of all parties. As far back as 1977&#x2014;six years ago&#x2014;the National Consumer Council submitted a response to the <i>Mobile Homes Review</i> published by the Department of the Environment, and since has taken other initiatives, including liaising with the DoE and, indeed, with Members of all parties in an expert, practical and understanding way. Therefore, we owe them a debt. I believe that Parliament and, indeed, the Government have been helped by this expert advice, given impartially to all concerned. I believe that the Bill is better for their co-operation and the co-operation of others. With those few words I should like to welcome these amendments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02513"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with great pleasure that I should like to associate myself with almost every word that the noble Lord, Lord Bishopston, has just said, and to say how grateful I am for the measures taken by the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02514"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a few words about the amendments, which achieve the purpose which we had outlined when we discussed the matter in Committee as long ago as 6th December, when several of us ventured to suggest that there was no reason for the retention of the site owner's right of first refusal on the sale. On that occasion the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, told us that the amendment that we were proposing, which was designed to achieve exactly what we are now doing, was a very sweeping one. So we are very grateful for the late conversion of the Government to the point of view that we expressed. We are also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, for underlining the fact that it was again your Lordships who put forward the concept on which the amendment is based, although it was finally implemented in another place.<lb/>
I share the good wishes for the Bill which have been expressed on all sides. It seems to me that over the last 15 years there has been a minor revolution in the attitude of Parliament to the relationships between mobile home residents and site operators. I say that because at the beginning of that period the mobile home resident had no protection whatsoever, even against immediate eviction. That protection was first secured in the 1968 Act, and then, in the 1975 Act we went a little further in consideration of formal agreements between the residents and the site operators. Now we have implemented a far more thorough scheme, which gives protection to the residents without I believe in any way undermining the ability of the site operators to provide a good service, and one for which they can obtain a fair reward.<lb/>
I believe that we are at the beginning of a new era in the relationships between site operators and mobile home residents. Obviously, everything is not going to be all sweetness and light, and we are still receiving from residents indications which perhaps suggest that in some respects we could have done a little more. However, with good will between the residents and the
<col>596</col>
owners, there is at last the possibility of ensuring that a harmonious system is developed, in which both groups will benefit from the legislation which Parliament is now passing.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02532"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that we had better speak now, rather than on the Motion that the Bill do now pass. I realise that the Bill has to go through because if it does not go through pensioners will not receive their increase in November, whether it be 4 per cent. or 6 per cent. In my candid opinion it is a pity that the Government did not accept the amendment put down by the noble Lord, Lord Banks, to consider six-monthly reviews in future. In Committee the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, said that that would mean 1,300 extra staff. Later, in reply to a point that I put to him, he said that he doubted whether any people who were unemployed were qualified to do the work. In passing I would remind the noble Lord that there are among the unemployed many university graduates, as well as grammar school sixth-formers with O- and A- level qualifications.<lb/>
I do not intend to say much more, other than to add something which is rather more pleasant. I might not be speaking on the Dentists Bill, and the other Bill, and so I should now like to express my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, and to compliment him on the way in which he has handled the various Bills at their different stages. Of course, that does not mean to say that I agree with him, but on the other hand one should recognise efficiency when one sees it, and courtesy when one receives it, particularly in regard to the very prompt and detailed replies which many of us received. Therefore, having been a little unkind at the beginning, I should like to take the opportunity to thank the noble Lord very sincerely.

We are not in agreement with the removal of over &#x00A3;200 million from the benefits system: nor were we able to agree with the Government that the biannual up-rating of pensions was an impossible task to contemplate. We very much hope that in the near future we shall be able to implement our own programme for pensioners, which will include up-rating twice a year. We hope that the electorate will see the merit of our proposals; but if, by some unfortunate mischance, that should not be the case, we shall keep a very watchful eye on the functioning of the system as proposed in the Bill.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to add my thanks to those already expressed to the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, for the way in which in this Parliament he has handled the social security Bills which have come before your
<col>598</col>
Lordships' House, and for the great lucidity of his exposition and his willingness to listen to comments, and in some cases even to accept minor amendments.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02538">Moved, that the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Cockfield</i>).</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02539"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, by convention and, indeed, in part by law, your Lordships' House is debarred from doing anything very much about the Finance Bill. But it has become the established convention over the years that discussion of the Finance Bill provides an opportunity for a review of the economic state and prospects of the nation. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, has made many notable contributions on this subject over the last four years when he and I have faced one another across the respective Dispatch Boxes. Yesterday, we had the opportunity of discussing the industrial state of the nation. I would not wish to weary your Lordships by going over again what was discussed in some detail then. Nevertheless, this occasion provides the House with the opportunity of considering the Government's performance in general over the last four years and of listening to the very learned response of the noble Lord.<lb/>
The most notable feature in the taxation field to which the Finance Bill itself relates, but which I do not intend to discuss in detail, is the way the Government have discharged their election manifesto promises to reduce the level of taxation. I have been known sometimes to address the House in what I think have been well merited yet terse terms on this subject. It suffices for my purpose today to give the version of <i>The Times</i> concerning the manner in which the Government have discharged this mandate. According to <i>The Times</i> of 21st April:
<quote>"A cut of 7p in the basic rate of income tax would be needed to restore the real tax burden, adjusted for inflation, of a typical family to its level before this government took office, the Treasury has revealed. The figure applies to a married man with two children on average earnings. This takes into account the rise in income tax (less child benefit) and national insurance contributions between 1978&#2013;79 and 1983&#2013;84. The figures demonstrate that despite the tax cuts in the last Budget the Government has failed to fulfil its election pledge to reduce the tax burden at all income levels. Only the most affluent now pay less tax than they did four years ago".</quote>
Those are somewhat sedate terms in which to express the situation but the facts unpleasantly remain&#x2014;that after all this time and after all the hardships through which the nation has passed, this is the position in which the Government are left at the
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0307"/>
<col>599</col>
end of all their fiscal policies. It is no good the Government saying that the recent Budget changes, measured in real terms, leave the average worker 19p a week better off. It may be the case, on the basis of rises in wages suitably adjusted for inflation, that this is the ultimate take-home benefit. However, this contrasts with the facts revealed in <i>The Times</i> of 5th May that directors' average pay now reaches &#x00A3;40,825 per annum, and that the salaries of directors rose last year by 13.9 per cent. We are not talking of 13 per cent. on &#x00A3;4,000 or &#x00A3;5,000 a year. We are talking of 13 per cent. on a very much higher average. Despite all the protestations of the Government originally in relation to tax, the poor have got poorer and the rich have got richer.<lb/>
The other feature of their policy that the Government proposed to carry out was dedicated to control of the money supply. I shall he merciful with the noble Lord on this point. I shall not go into the matter in too great a detail. Everyone now knows that the Government's assumptions on monetary policy&#x2014;that reducing the money supply would automatically have beneficial consequences on inflation&#x2014;have turned out to be complete nonsense. In fact, had the Government's own assumptions that there was a two-year time lag between rises and falls in money supply and their effect on inflation been realised the inflation rate now would be running at well over 20 per cent. The arguments adduced at the time by the noble Lord supported by one noble Lord from the Cross-Benches, Lord Harris of High Cross&#x2014;I do not see the noble Lord with us today&#x2014;have been completely disproved.<lb/>
The other policies that the Government have carried out have had disastrous effects. The noble Lord knows full well by now that the rise in interest rates upon which the Government embarked, together with the coming of North Sea oil, succeeded in raising the exchange rate. At one time, this was regarded by the Government as a very desirable objective. The House will recall the Prime Minister's pride when the exchange rate reached 2&#x00B7;40 dollars to the pound. One recalls how proud she was that the pound could look the dollar in the face. But, of course, the consequences for British industry were disastrous. The exchange rate was a grave impediment to our exporters whose competitive position was made very hard indeed.<lb/>
At the same time, imports into this country were facilitated. Although this had the desired effect, which I have no doubt the noble Lord had in mind, of bringing down the rate of inflation, it also devastated wide sections of British industry. Owing to the artificially low price of imported manufactures, hundreds upon hundreds of British firms were driven out of business. So that has been the other result.<lb/>
The marginal result was that the City of London benefited very much by these policies. Indeed, it has been merrily operating not so much for the provision of funds for new investment in British industry but more particularly for a whole series of takeovers of existing enterprises based upon anticipated yields that have come into perspective from time to time.<lb/>
Therefore, while wide sections of the British public have suffered, while unemployment has risen to well over 4 million&#x2014;after having made allowances for the figures that have disappeared from the register, which have already been dealt with&#x2014;we have now reached
<col>600</col>
the stage where one in every seven of the population is on supplementary benefit. That is a rather formidable consequence of the policies that have been carried out. As the <i>Financial Times</i> was constrained to put it in its editorial on Tuesday, 10th May:
<quote>"On the face of it, the economic record of her Government looks bad; the rise in unemployment, especially young unemployed, the decline in output and the absence of growth. Only the performance in reducing inflation is outstandingly good. The task in the election campaign is to demonstrate that this will lead to recovery".</quote>
It goes on to say:
<quote>"No Government deserves a second term in office if it cannot reasonably promise to bring unemployment down".</quote>
In my view that is a very reasonable statement.<lb/>
But what are the prospects? One of the most extraordinary occurrences over the past few weeks has been the endeavour to suppress the report of the National Economic Development Council which was referred to in <i>The Times</i> of 12th April. The reason for that is quite clear. The particularly survey, which incidentally had been compiled from 40 National Economic Development Office sector committee assessments of the prospects to the end of the decade, came to the conclusion, not aided by any party political considerations, that no increase in jobs was in prospect for the rest of the decade. Perhaps that is the reason why the election is being called now. Perhaps if the Government had neglected to go to the country for much longer, developments later on in the year would have borne out the position as stated by NEDO. We know quite well that the Director General of the CBI, whose close association with and affection for the Conservative Party was well revealed at a recent dinner, seems to be more optimistic. There has been optimism before but the result has never materialised anywhere above the horizon.<lb/>
The fact of the matter is that, whatever they may say in the forthcoming election campaign, the Government have no policies to offer the country which can demonstrate with any kind of reasonable expectation, with any kind of reasonable regard for the truth, that they are going to reduce unemployment measureably within the next decade, or certainly within the life time of any future Government with which a misguided electorate might entrust them. If the noble Lord has any observations to offer to the contrary in his reply, if he can hold out any prospect which is based upon reasonable expectations, he has a perfect opportunity to do so. However, it will require more than the continuation of grinding reference to some of the homilies with which we have been regaled over the past four years, to reassure the public that the Government have any real plans that enable this very considerable blot on the whole of the social and economic landscape of the United Kingdom to be reduced, let alone obliterated.<lb/>
In more recent months the Government have drummed into our heads, and are continuing to do so, that there are no prospects of what they describe as "real jobs" unless the country become more competitive. We on these Benches are all for British industry' and British commerce becoming more competitive. We are all for industry becoming more efficient. These are defects in British industry at all levels, not least, I am bound to say, at management levels.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0308"/>
<col>601</col>
However, I want to deal with the last plank upon which the Government are basing their policies: the necessity for the United Kingdom to become more and more competitive. I am omitting from the argument for the moment the effect that the exchange rate of the pound against other currencies has had upon the competitiveness of British industry, although of course it is quite considerable. The noble Lord knows quite well that when the pound was at its peak in New York, it made British products uncompetitive to the tune of about 50 per cent.&#x2014;an almost impossible situation.<lb/>
I do not want to discuss competition in a vacuum or even by reference to numerous statistics, because statistics can be manipulated a number of ways according to the bent of the person who is offering them, and they are very often presented outside the context for which they were originally intended. In previous debates I have drawn the attention of the House to various examples. Indeed, one can only deal with these matters by supplying concrete examples that have been the subject of detailed and independent research. I demonstrated some months ago as regards Wales an example where British workers, supplied with identical equipment and working under similar conditions, were just as productive as foreign nationals. I also demonstrated that the wage rates applicable in the United Kingdom and, to some extent, applicable throughout Europe sometimes at higher levels, were not in fact responsible for the degree of uncompetitiveness that arose. The figures that I gave and the sources that I quoted have at no time been disputed by any noble Lord and, indeed, have not been disputed by the Government. Therefore, the question of competition becomes of some importance.<lb/>
The House will recall that more recently, on 7th April last, we found out the Government's attitude towards competition by foreign countries, even by countries outside those within what is called "the Western sphere of influence"&#x2014;in other words, the OECD countries. Your Lordships will recall that I instanced the case of the British Shipbuilders' quote for a cable ship which, through a somewhat mysterious route involving a company called International Transport Management or rather ITM (Offshore) Limited, (who for some obscure reason had not filed their accounts for a couple of years) went to a Korean company by the name of Hyundai, and I never got any response to that.<lb/>
One thing that was important was that the Prime Minister was involved in making the decision that British Shipbuilders, or the subsidiary of British Shipbuilders, should not get the contract. Your Lordships will recall that it was quite proved&#x2014;and my figures were nowhere challenged, though there has been abundant opportunity to do so&#x2014;that the competition we were getting from South Korea was largely based on the fact that the wage rates there were some 23 per cent. of those applicable in Europe, and there were other factors involved as well. These matters were never satisfactorily answered.<lb/>
The expressed attitude of the Government is that not only does United Kingdom industry have to compete with the other industrial countries of the West in the OECD countries, including Japan and the
<col>602</col>
United States, it also has to compete, and the Government are determined that it shall compete, with countries such as South Korea which are among the newly-industrialised countries, and I believe which the noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, had the opportunity of visiting recently. He will undoubtedly at some time, whether on these Benches or the other Benches, according to how the arithmetic goes, give us some account of his visit there.<lb/>
However, I have some fresh news to tell the House. Not only did this contract go to this South Korean company, Hyundai, on the basis of what on all accounts was completely unfair competition, from which it was the duty of Her Majesty's Government to protect British manufacturers in exactly the same way as the United States has not the slightest hesitation, where it gets instances of this kind, of protecting its own, but it also went to a company&#x2014;and I speak not under parliamentary privilege but in reading the <i>Financial Times</i> of 24th April last from page 9 of the Saudi Arabian supplement&#x2014;which was banned for two years for bribery in Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it can only recently have emerged from the status of suspension. Therefore, not only do we willingly condone the passage of contracts to countries which trade unfairly, but we also allow them to go to companies which have been banned in other countries for bribery.<lb/>
The facts about Hyundai's suspension for bribery must have been known to our Foreign Office representatives in Riyadh. If they did not know, then they were not doing their job properly. If they were known by the Foreign Office, as they should have been since the Saudi-Korean matter had been raised at that time, they should have been transmitted to the Prime Minister's office. But the position is that not only are Her Majesty's Government prepared to tolerate unfair competition on the basis of wages costs which are enforced by a semi-military Government whose trade unions function in very much the same way as those to which the Government and Opposition object in Poland, but from companies which have a history of bribery.<lb/>
It would be interesting to hear the reply of Her Majesty's Government on that, and the extent to which they are willing in future to allow these things to happen. The matter is more apposite because there is a company in the East Docklands area called Blackwall Engineering Limited which recently tendered to the Central Electricity Generating Board&#x2014;the CEGB again&#x2014;for some ship repairs in the comparatively small sum of &#x00A3;77,000. It was told by the CEGB that its price was very competitive, but we now learn that this contract also has gone to this mysterious company, ITM, and we wonder whether this has also gone to Korea.<lb/>
These are serious matters. It is far better to raise them, as I have done today, in the particular than to talk in generality about them. The fact of the matter is that the Government are quite prepared for this competition to continue. All they are really seeking to do, if they can, is to depress British wage levels, and endure further British unemployment if they cannot depress their wage levels to those subsisting in South Korea. I hope that the Government are going to answer that.<lb/>

<col>603</col>
I shall close shortly, and I must apologise for keeping the House, but these matters are of some importance and they deserve to be aired in Parliament. The Government came to office on the basis of uniting the nation. They have done nothing of the kind. All they have done is to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer. These are long days from the days when we were last in crisis in World War II, when there was a greater measure of fairness and justice among all our population. The fact that there was a greater measure of fairness and justice produced that purpose which took us through the war itself. The Government's task, in the face of the depression largely induced by them, was at least to unify the nation by a greater measure of fairness and justice. This they have not done. For this, they ought to be condemned.</membercontribution></p>

One thing he will remember is that by the division of labour which took place during the war itself we ourselves bore the great brunt of the damage inflicted on us by the enemy. The United States suffered no damage to its industries; indeed, many of them were enhanced by the war effort itself. So far as we are concerned we, at 1945 prices (and they are very much higher today) sustained damage of about &#x00A3;7,158 million. We started off right from the bottom, and it is to the great credit of post-war Governments that progressively we enhanced our position from that situation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02543"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I propose to take two minutes to raise one point, a personal point I fear, which springs from a parliamentary Question asked on 26th April. The noble Lord, Lord Cockfield, on that occasion went to some trouble to give details of the improvement since 1979 in the position of a man earning &#x00A3;45,000 a year. He made the claim, quite properly, that this was due to the Government's taxation policy. He also stated that the position of an unemployed man had improved since 1979.<lb/>
I asked the Minister to make it clear whether the position of the unemployed man had improved because of an enlightened tax policy, or whether it was not due to the higher benefits from a contributory pension scheme. The noble Lord, rather surprisingly, is reported as saying that there seemed some innuendo in my question, and he proposed to ignore it. Several noble Lords, not all on these Benches I might add, have expressed surprise at the use of that rather scurvy term "innuendo". My admiration for the Government's financial policy does not exceed that of my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington. But my
<col>604</col>
affection for the noble Lord himself is a factor of parliamentary life. I therefore give him this opportunity to withdraw an expression which was not in keeping with the spirit of my supplementary question. After all, why resort to innuendo when the facts speak so clearly?<lb/>
When a choice has to be made this Government invariably have helped the wealthier as opposed to the poorer people. To some extent, the Finance Bill, which we are ostensibly considering, has been expurgated for reasons of expediency and it does not therefore go as far as it would have gone. Nevertheless, it still remains a fact that the Government's taxation policy has been retrogressive. I hope that the noble Lord will accept that when that criticism is made it is fairly made and cannot be dismissed as an innuendo.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02544"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was Richard Brinsley Sheridan who said:
<quote>"The right honourable gentleman is indebted to his memory for his jests and to his imagination for his facts".</quote>
I have never accused the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, of making a jest, but when it comes to his facts his imagination is, at times, a little awry.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, started by saying that the convention had grown up over the years that the Finance Bill should be the occasion for a broad-ranging debate on the economy. He certainly ranged broadly enough. I would, however, refer him to a speech made by his noble friend the Lord McCluskey on 4th April 1979&#x2014;the Labour Government had then fallen by vote of another place. As a result, your Lordships were considering, as they are on this occasion, a Finance Bill which had been agreed between the parties for rapid implementation. Lord McCluskey said this:
<quote>"My Lords, I understand that I have a right of reply, although I am astonished to find that I am called upon to exercise it, as I had understood that the proceedings in relation to this Bill would, as normally, be formal".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 4/4/1979; col. 1913.]</quote>
I hope the noble Lord will have the opportunity of refreshing his memory during the Recess which lies ahead.<lb/>
I propose to concentrate on the Finance Bill, but before I do so I should reply to the noble Lord, Lord Beswick. The last thing in the world I should want to do would be either to cast any reflection on him or to cause him any distress. I hope he will understand in what I am saying that that is very much in my mind. The words used by the noble Lord were as follows:
<quote>"I wonder if the noble Lord could make it absolutely clear, so that we may follow these matters more fairly".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 26/4/83; col. 802.]</quote>
The implication of the words "more fairly" was that what I was saying was unfair. It was in that sense that I understood the noble Lord to be making his point.<lb/>
The word "innuendo" is a legal term and in relation to the use of the word "fairly" in the context in which it was used by the noble Lord, I felt it was correct to describe that as an innuendo. But I hasten to assure the noble Lord that there was no intention whatever on my part of casting any reflection upon him. I hope that he will accept that explanation in this spirit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02545"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I accept that, but if I ask for something to be considered fairly I mean
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0310"/>
<col>605</col>
that I want it to be considered fairly and that there is absolutely no question ever of there being some underlying innuendo in that. I accept what the noble Lord has said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02546"><member>Lord Cockfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to expand on what I have said which I believe answers the point that the noble Lord has now made. I wish to repeat that the last thing in my mind was to cast any aspersion or to cause the noble Lord, for whom I have great respect, any distress in this matter.<lb/>
I shall now return to the Finance Bill. This is not the Bill as it was introduced by the Government. It is the price of their co-operation in the passage of legislation essential to the proper administration of the country. The Opposition have forced amendments to a number of important clauses. These comprise: first, Clause 12, where the effect of the amendment forced by the Opposition will be to hold the thresholds at which people begin to pay the higher rates of tax and the investment income surcharge at the 1982&#2013;83 levels, rather than to increase them by 14 per cent., as the Government had proposed.<lb/>
Secondly, Clause 15 is the clause on small companies' corporation tax, where the effect of the amendment forced by the Opposition is to leave the profit limits for the small companies' rate of corporation tax at their existing levels, rather than to increase them substantially as the Government had proposed.<lb/>
Thirdly, Clause 18: the effect of the amendment imposed by the Opposition is to maintain the mortgage interest relief limit for 1983&#2013;84 at &#x00A3;25,000 rather than to increase it to &#x00A3;30,000, as the Government had proposed. The Opposition apparently claim&#x2014;although the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, barely addressed himself to the Bill&#x2014;that their actions on the Bill reflect some high principle. The reality is that the Opposition's actions are both mean-minded and, were they to have any lasting effect, disadvantageous to many groups in the country.<lb/>
The amendement to the income tax clause&#x2014;that is Clause 12&#x2014;forced by the Opposition will mean that some 300,000 people will be brought into the higher rate charge of tax and nearly 1 million people in all will pay more tax. The people who are affected are for the most part middle managers, professional people and people making their way in business&#x2014;the very people who are essential to ensuring growth and the creation of wealth. But the truth is much worse than that. Every single one of the 25 million or so people paying income tax is now under threat by the Opposition.<lb/>
Last time the Labour Government increased the rate of tax from 30 per cent. to 35 per cent. What we are now seeing is the thin end of a very nasty wedge. Let there be no mistake about this. The Labour Party stands for higher taxation for everybody. The sheep's clothing has now slipped, and we see the very nasty wolf underneath.<lb/>
We have promised, immediately we are returned to power, that we will reinstate the reliefs and allowances that the Opposition have deleted. Were the Opposition to win, every one of the million people liable to higher rate tax will be fined by the Labour Government as they claw back the relief already given. The same
<col>606</col>
politics of envy are evident in the Opposition's attempts to impose a lower limit for mortgage interest relief&#x2014;a limit of &#x00A3;25,000 rather than the &#x00A3;30,000 that the Government had proposed. This is a blow struck not only at the householders immediately affected but, in the long run, at everyone who wishes to buy his own home. The threat is there. The limit of &#x00A3;25,000 was originally set in 1974. It has been heavily eroded. The Labour Party simply do not want people to own their own homes, and they are determined to penalise those who do so.<lb/>
All I would say in conclusion is this. The Bill itself, as originally presented, typified the Government's policies to improve the environment in which enterprise and wealth creation operate, creating the foundations for sustained recovery of output and employment. I therefore commend the Bill to the House, even truncated as it is, with a promise that in the not too distant future I shall be commending to your Lordships a second Finance Bill which will consign the Opposition's actions to the discard of fiscal history.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Importation of Milk Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02557">5.45 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02558"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Importation of Milk Bill be now read a second time. The Bill is a necessary consequence of a judgment of the European Court which found the United Kingdom's domestic regulations, which applied to ultraheat-treated milk, to be contrary to Community law. The judgment was delivered on 8th February of this year, and it is essential to take steps to comply with it as soon as possible if we are to avoid being taken back to the court under Article 171 of the Treaty of Rome.<lb/>
Arrangements were therefore made to introduce this brief enabling Bill, and it was given its First Reading in another place on 28th April. It was expected to receive its Second Reading there today. These plans were, of course, overtaken by Monday's announcement, and the Government had to decide whether to abandon the Bill or to press ahead with it. The Government concluded that the delay which would have been created by abandoning the Bill would have increased the risk of further legal action which might have obliged us to admit imports without any checks at all. We have therefore sought Parliament's agreement to expedite the passage of the Bill with what is almost, but not total, unprecedented alacrity in endeavouring to secure the passage of all its stages, except the First Reading, today.<lb/>
Inevitably, this means that there will not be the usual opportunity for detailed scrutiny in Committee, which I greatly regret. I know that there are certain bodies which have an interest in the subject which are understandably unhappy about this. On that particular issue, I would merely make two points. First, since the judgment the Ministry of Agriculture has been in very close touch with such bodies as the National Farmers' Union, the Milk Marketing Board and the Dairy Trade Federation, which all have an interest in the matter. These contacts will of course continue. Secondly, although the Bill does not provide specifically for consultations, I can assure your Lordships that there will of course be consultations. It will clearly be necessary to take account of the views of interested parties before any regulations are made; and there will be the usual full discussion.<lb/>
The Bill allows agriculture Ministers to make regulations to govern the importation of milk and the use of milk once it has been imported. The guts of the Bill (if I may so put it) is in Clause 1. It is widely drafted, but its essential purpose is to allow Ministers to establish a comprehensive import r&#x00E9;gime which the court's judgment recognises we may apply. In particular, it provides that regulations may deal with ports of entry, with certification of imports and with the inspection and testing of imported milk. It also provides for the regulations to adjust our domestic legislation, which was found incompatible with
<col>608</col>
Community law, in order to allow the sale of imported milk and to make various other provisions in order to reflect the fact that imports are now allowed.<lb/>
I have deliberately concentrated on Clause 1 of the Bill because this contains all the essential provisions. Clause 2 indicates that the regulations in question are to be made by Statutory Instrument, or statutory rule in Northern Ireland, and they are subject to negative resolution. Clause 2 also defines the various terms which are used in the Bill, and it makes it clear that regulations may deal, not only with milk and cream but also with various milk-based products, such as flavoured milk drinks. Clause 3 simply gives the Short Title of the Bill and indicates that it extends to Northern Ireland.<lb/>
I thought&#x2014;and I hope that I have judged the House rightly&#x2014;that your Lordships would not wish for a long debate about the problems of milk, which are well known. I have therefore deliberately kept my remarks briefer than normal courtesy would suggest in order to explain that this Bill is really an enabling Bill to keep the United Kingdom in line with the European Court's judgment.<lb/>
Perhaps I could remind the House of the Statement which my right honourable friend made on 9th February and which I repeated in your Lordships' House. We said then that the Government would comply with the judgment and would provide for the import of ultra heat-treated milk from other member states, subject to its satisfying the same health and hygiene requirements on which, in the interest of public health, we insist for the production and processing of our own milk. This Bill is in full accord with that Statement, which received a wide measure of support, and I hope that your Lordships will give this Bill a Second Reading. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02561"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your leave&#x2014;because my name does not appear on the list&#x2014;I should like to make a small intervention. I will not detain your Lordships long; but as the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, has said, under other circumstances there would have been considerable debate on this Bill because it affects an important industry in this country. It requires a mere 10 per cent. switch in trade from doorstep deliveries to supermarket deliveries of UHT milk to bring about a cessation of doorstep deliveries in many places. I am sure your Lordships are well aware that quite apart from the financial consequences to the dairies in this country, the social consequences of losing our doorstep deliveries are very great indeed because in many areas of the country and in many areas of population, notably the old, the doorstep delivery is their one daily link with the world outside.<lb/>
Not only does the Labour Party wish that people should own their own homes; it also wishes them to have their milk delivered to the doorstep. I hope that whatever these regulations may be&#x2014;and I am relieved to hear they will be discussed in full with the trade&#x2014;whatever they may be I hope the Government will see that this can continue.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02563"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had a lot of bandying across the Dispatch Box about the conventions of what was what, and I assume there is no convention about a Bill on UHT milk. I think that the Bill has been published in a hurry, as the noble Earl the Minister has said. The noble Earl said there had been discussion with the various bodies but not sufficient time to have their opinions, and that must be right. We have had a note from the National Farmers' Union but not from any of the other bodies concerned. I am glad to hear from the noble Earl that his contacts will continue in due course.<lb/>
I think the Bill is necessary not only to protect consumers, who naturally would want to think that any milk from any other country was treated, packed and delivered in as good a way as we do it in this country, but it must also protect the producers who in this country are under very strict production and hygiene controls in our dairies. I have been a dairyman for many years and I know that it is quite an expensive business putting in the equipment today and engaging and paying the men to do the job properly, to produce clean milk from the farms. So this should apply to any milk coming from abroad.<lb/>
In the other place when the Bill was going through yesterday, the Parliamentary Secretary emphasised that the quality of milk before treatment must be the same as ours. She emphasised this twice very sharply indeed. I think we have no regulations yet as to how this is to be done, and I wonder whether the noble Earl can enlighten us as to how one is to police production of milk from dairies from other countries if what has been emphasised in another place and what I have just said is to take place.<lb/>
On page 2, paragraph (4)(<i>a</i>), there is the phrase, "as to the quality of the milk". That refers to the quality before it goes into the carton, before it is processed in any way. I would be interested to know how this can possibly be done. Quite frankly I think it is necessary to do that to protect producers in this country.<lb/>
A few years ago I was in France with a party. I became bored with the holiday spirit so I asked to see a dairy in the Maritime Alps. They sent me to a big outfit which had about 120 to 150 cows taken up for summer milking. They were milked in a shed by hand. The dung from the cows was scraped out over the generations and I am not exaggerating when I say that it was flowing down the hill like the lava from Etna is flowing at the moment. That was all that happened to it. There were dogs knocking about lifting their legs at the milk cans. The water supply was non-existent so far as I could see. They boiled stream water in the dirtiest copper I have ever seen. The milk was made into cheese on the spot, and I would hate to think that that sort of milk was going to be processed. Of course you can use ultra heat treatment and make milk hygienic, but I would hate to consume it when produced under the conditions that I saw. I may add that for the next few nights I noticed that no one took cheese after dinner. I think that checking of this milk is most essential because after all ultra heat treatment hides a lot.<lb/>
I appreciate the situation of not being able to discuss or amend the Bill, but if I wanted to put down an
<col>610</col>
amendment on line 27, page 2, it would be to the effect that I do not not know why we need to put in the phrase, "consider necessary or expedient". Personally, I do not like the word "expedient". I looked it up in the Oxford Dictionary to discover the actual meaning, which is, "Politic rather than just". This might apply to the Government&#x2014;"politic rather than just"&#x2014;but to put in the word "expedient" after "consider it necessary" seems to be unnecessary.<lb/>
So far as I can see, the main point from discussing this with processors in this country is that we can easily have competition with people producing UHT milk on the Continent if we can produce at the same price, and there is no reason why we should not do this. To process UHT milk and put it in a carton&#x2014;it has to have a special carton&#x2014;costs about 5&#x00BD;p a pint against 4p for ordinary pasteurised milk, also in a carton. That milk costs a lot to transport. I made inquiries as to whether we could not transport liquid milk to areas where children are starving, and it is an expensive business. It cannot be cheap to get it to this country, and we should remember that milk is 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. water. We should be able to compete and I should like to think we can because, as my noble friend behind me said, anything that would harm the doorstep delivery in this country would be terrible. If we can compete and we can deliver it along with pasteurised milk on the doorstep then we do not have a lot to fear. But whenever I discuss doorstep delivery with people, they are horrified that they might lose it. It has stood the test of time and I think we should do everything to see that doorstep deliveries continue. I think the figure that my noble friend quoted, even at 10 per cent. reduction, would put out of business a lot of milk rounds. This is something we should think carefully about.<lb/>
My Lords, with the reservation that the Bill is a hurried one, and I hope we shall be able to debate the regulations because they will be very complicated indeed, whichever Government is there to do it, we are prepared in the meantime to let it go through.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02564"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that my name is not on the list of speakers but I hope I may be permitted to intervene briefly. I should like to say that while I welcome this Bill there are one or two questions I should like to ask in connection with it. The noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, has put the point of view of the producers. I want to stress very much the standpoint of the consumers in the regulations in relation to the Bill.<lb/>
If this milk is cheap it is something which a great many people would welcome. We are told continually that it is not nice. If it is not nice and if people think that, they will not buy it. But if they want to buy it and it is cheaper than the existing milk, then it is highly desirable that they should be able to do so.<lb/>
I notice that the Bill says that satisfaction must be given with regard to quality. I should like to ask the Minister one question about quality. Obviously, we must have protection against milk which is not healthy; but there are qualities of milk, and a lower quality of milk which is cheaper is what some people want. When we talk of quality, are we simply saying that we will exclude milk which is not hygienic? That, of course, must be right. Are we saying that we are
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0313"/>
<col>611</col>
going to discriminate against milk which, although perfectly hygienic, is not of such good quality as some of the milk produced here but which nevertheless is fit for human consumption? Some people may very much prefer to have a larger quantity of such milk than a small quantity, or even none at all, of the better-quality milk? May we take it that this Bill, as it comes before us, fully conforms&#x2014;I am sure it does but I should like to emphasise the point&#x2014;with all the requirements of the EEC and indeed of GATT, and that there is no more creeping protectionism behind this Bill to add to all the creeping protectionism we are getting from so many quarters at the present time?<lb/>
Having said that, like the noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, we on these Benches will be very interested to see the regulations. We welcome the Bill guardedly and we want to be sure that the consumer interest is not overshadowed by the producer interest in discussion of this measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02565"><member>Lord Boothby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who introduced the original national milk scheme, which was passed without a Division in another place at the height of the Battle of Britain. I would only ask the Minister whether he can give us an assurance that this Bill will not involve any serious interruption in the supply of cheap milk for the children of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02566">6.2 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02567"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to your Lordships for having given the Bill a speedy recognition. If I may answer the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, first, I would assure him that this Bill does not in any way affect the supply of school milk for children. Its sole purpose&#x2014;and here I am answering the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear&#x2014;is to protect the consumer from having milk of an inferiror quality. I take her point very readily that there are questions of quality of production and of quality of content. The regulations to be introduced will refer to the quality of production because what we have in our country at the moment, under which our milk has always been sold, are very strict regulations as to the manner in which the milk is produced, the premises on which they are produced and the conditions in which that milk is bottled or pasteurised.<lb/>
Our wish is to see that any milk which comes into this country which the European Court's judgment says should be allowed is produced to the same standards of production and processing. The court's judgment recognises our right to do that, and the purpose of the Bill is to accede to the court's judgment in allowing to come in milk which will satisfy the consumer and to allow us, as a country, to protect the quality of the milk which our citizens will consume.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02568"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl. I should have apologised when I spoke earlier because I was not here when he made his opening speech. I am afraid I was caught up in the election campaign.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02569"><member>Earl Ferrers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for what she has said. She need not worry at all. I am sure that her involvement in the election campaign, even if it might be a trifle premature, is
<col>612</col>
perhaps even more important than her observations on the Bill, although they are important too.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, was entirely right to express concern about the doorstep delivery. For some extraordinary reason there have been one or two sparks flying across the Chamber this aftrernoon, but I am delighted to find that the Opposition and the Government are in total harmony over this matter. We want to see the doorstep delivery retained. My right honourable friend has gone out of his way, time and time again, since he has been Minister of Agriculture, to say that this is a vital part because it provides, among other things, a social service. It enables people to know what is going on, especially in connection with households with elderly folk. I do not think the noble Baroness need worry unduly because at the moment only about 1 per cent. of the milk is UHT milk, and it is only when the milk supply in the supermarkets gets to unprecedently large proportions that people may prefer to go to the supermarkets rather than have their milk delivered on the doorstep. In the end, it is up to the housewives to decide; and the value of the doorstep milk and its quality is. I would suggest, infinitely better than the UHT milk, which is of a different calibre altogether.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, asked how we would police the production of milk. I would tell him that at present consultations are going on in this country and in Europe on precisely that type of point. We want to be able to satisfy ourselves that the milk is produced in the right kinds of conditions, and I cannot believe that the conditions he described would be remotely acceptable to our consumers. Incidentally, Mr. Dalsager himself was so keen to find out about the doorstep delivery of milk that he accompanied a delivery man on one occasion in this country to find out how it is done.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, asked why the word "expedient" was in the Bill, as well as "necessary". He said he did not think it was necessary. Without going into undue semantics, I would suggest that something may be necessary and on another occasion it may be expedient or desirable but may not be necessary. It is for that reason that this modest word was put in; but I do not think it really affects the substance of the Bill<lb/>
I am grateful to your Lordships for the welcome you have given to the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord John-Mackie, said that he looked forward to debating the regulations. I am sure he does and I would not wish to dishearten him, but I would remind him that they are subject to negative resolution and he would be able to debate them if he wishes to pray against them.</membercontribution></p>

I must mention at the outset that there are several printing errors in the list of Commons amendments before your Lordships today. In particular, I would refer to: page 5, Amendment No. 16, fifth line of subsection (3) of the new clause,
<col>614</col>
after "subsection", a line has been missed out which should read "a person may be represented before the Committee by counsel or a solicitor"; page 7, Amendment No. 22, subsection (4) of the new clause, third line, "and appointment" should read "an appointment"; page 8, Amendment No. 28, penultimate line of paragraph (1) of the new clause "a fine or not exceeding" should read "a fine not exceeding": and, finally, on page 9, Amendment No. 38, the reference to "Page 17" should be to "Page 19". There are also a number of small typographical errors which, perhaps, do not need to be specifically corrected and with which I do not need to bother your Lordships in considering the amendments.<lb/>
It may be helpful if I briefly summarise the purpose of the Commons Amendments which we are considering. The first group, whose numbers I have given to your Lordships, relates to the constitution of the General Dental Council and of its subordinate committees. Three significant changes are proposed to the composition of the Council itself. In lieu of the three dentists currently nominated by Her Majesty, it is proposed to provide five <i>ex-officio</i> members; namely the president of the GDC and the four chief dental officers of the United Kingdom health departments. This, in practice, will allow the chief dental officers for Wales and Northern Ireland to sit on the GDC for the first time. Lay membership on the council will be increased from three to six, to preserve the proportions in the 1957 Act against the overall increase in the size of the council proposed by the Bill. In addition, an elected dental auxiliary will be given a place on the council in recognition of the GDC's responsibilities for dental therapists and dental hygienists.<lb/>
Proposals for the subordinate committees include increasing the number of elected dental auxiliaries on the Dental Auxiliaries Committee from three to six, setting an upper limit of 10 on the number of council members (other than the president) of that sub-committee, and renaming the Disciplinary Committee as the Professional Conduct Committee in keeping with the nomenclature of its GMC counterpart. The Government believe that all these proposals will assist the GDC in carrying out its duties and I commend them to your Lordships. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

They seem to me to be entirely satisfactory.

We had one in 1921; I think we had one in 1951 and we have another now. In those circumstances, I merely rise to say that it seems to me faintly regrettable, that having dealt with this 30 years' period Dentists Bill, we have had to deal with its final stages in somewhat indecent haste, I make no criticism of anybody for that.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02655"><member>Lord Colwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I just detain your Lordships for 60 seconds on Amendment No. 16? In my understanding, this amendment relates directly to the recent problems within the profession concerning the administration of anaesthesia and anaesthetics. I appreciate the concern of the Government, and the concern of the honourable Member for Lichfield and Tamworth, Mr. Heddle, whose representations, which I believe to be misguided and founded on reaction to the popular press rather than to scientific facts, have pressurised the General Dental Council via the Department of Health and Social Security into producing guidelines for the profession as to the use and administration of anaesthetic drugs.<lb/>
I have to declare an interest in that these guidelines directly affect my own practice, where my partner and I specialise in the treatment of patients who have a
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0317"/>
<col>619</col>
genuine fear of dentists. By being forced to take this step, the GDC are for the first time entering the political field, which I hope is not a sign of things to come. They do not need, nor require, any powers that can directly influence professional judgments as to the appropriate methods of treatment for different patients.<lb/>
I am also very concerned at the possible wide applications of this new clause, which may mean that the General Dental Council will have to take action when dentists are convicted of other criminal offences. The clause will surely give them a power far greater than the original intention of the amendment. I do not expect explanations from the Minister, but I wish at this stage just to have my doubts on this matter placed on the record. I assure the Government that I shall be keeping a very careful watch on the way in which this clause in the Bill is implemented when it becomes law. If necessary, at a later stage, I shall use whatever powers are at my disposal to try to correct what I believe to be a very serious defect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02656"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to comment briefly on Amendment No. 16. I welcome this part of the Bill, in so far as it is necessary to have the right of immediate suspension in cases where the public might genuinely be considered to be at risk, pending the hearing of a criminal case. I seek an assurance from the Minister that the practice of any general dental practitioner who is suspended prior to any hearing would be protected and that he would not lose in any way if later he was found to be not guilty of the charges and not deserving of any disciplinary action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02657"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that my noble friend raised this point at an earlier stage of the Bill. I gave her certain assurances then, which I hope on reflection she will regard as satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>

This amendment will ensure that there is an independent review by the commission of each detained patient at least every other year. Only a small proportion of detained patients remain in hospital for years on end, but it is important that these patients should be seen periodically by an outside agency to ensure that the continuation of their detention is not treated as a matter of routine because they have not availed themselves of their right to appeal for discharge.

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02746"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 14 to 34. At the same time I wish to speak to Amendment No. 65. All of these amendments relate to the provisions in Part IV of the principal Act. This deals with the detention and the guardianship of patients, as amended by Clauses 8 to 20 of the Bill. The amendments which were made in the other place are extensive but some are concerned with relatively minor clarifications and improvements. There are two matters to which I wish briefly to draw your Lordships' attention. The first relates to Amendments Nos. 14, 26 and 28 to 33 inclusive. These amendments make changes to the procedures which relate to
<col>626</col>
guardianship. Their effect is to emphasise the point that guardianship is essentially about the welfare of the patients concerned. In view of this, it is sensible to give the mental health officer and the local authority a greater part to play in the procedures for reception into guardianship, renewal of authority for guardianship, and so on.<lb/>
The second matter to which I wish briefly to refer is the subject of Amendment No. 17. This is short, but it is very significant. It reduces from six hours to two hours the period during which a nurse of the prescribed class&#x2014;that is, a registered nurse&#x2014;may detain an informal patient. Your Lordships had serious reservations about these provisions. Similar reservations were expressed in the other place. However, we believe it is right that a formal procedure should be available to nurses who wish to make use of it in circumstances where they feel that acting to prevent a patient from exposing himself or others to harm may result in legal action being taken against them.<lb/>
As your Lordships will appreciate, two hours is a relatively short period of time but it should nearly always be sufficient for a doctor to be brought to any Scottish hospital in order to take the matter out of the hands of the nurse.<lb/>
I shall not explain the other minor changes, unless there is any matter about which your Lordships wish to ask me.</membercontribution></p>

The effect of all these amendments is to improve and clarify in a number of relatively minor ways the provisions which relate to matters such as the provision of treatment, information for the patients and their relatives and the code of practice.

<title>Education (Fees and Awards) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02851">6.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02852"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. The Bill is designed to restore the position of overseas students in two important respects to what it was understood to be before a ruling given in your Lordships' House on 16th December last. There would have been serious consequences for institutions of higher education and for public expenditure, and also much uncertainty for students themselves, if the Government did not seek to have the regulations for which it provides made as early as possible before the next academic year.<lb/>
It has been the practice under successive Governments for overseas students to be treated differently from home students in three particular ways. First, they have not been entitled to mandatory awards, which are not the concern of this Bill; secondly, they have not been eligible for a variety of other grants&#x2014;discretionary awards&#x2014;that may be offered by education authorities, research councils and others; thirdly, they have been charged higher fees than home students. Under the present Government their tuition fees are expected to cover the full cost of their education, but previous Governments, too, have operated a differential fee system. The distinction between home and overseas students for these purposes has been based on the concept of "ordinary
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0325"/>
<col>635</col>
residence". Students were categorised as home students if they had been ordinarily resident in this country for a specified period, usually three years. The test of whether or not a student was ordinarily resident here was generally taken to be that of whether or not his real home was here. For example, boys and girls who came here for a few years to go to school were believed not to become ordinarily residents here if their real home remained in another country.<lb/>
Last year, however, your Lordships ruled that the question to be asked was: has the applicant shown that he has habitually and normally resided in the United Kingdom from choice and for a settled purpose throughout the prescribed period, apart from temporary or occasional absences? This clarification provided certainty in an area which had been increasingly open to doubt. But it meant that a student's ordinary residence alone was no longer a sufficient basis for distinguishing between home and overseas students, mainly because it brought within the category of home students those who come here simply to receive their education by attending an independent school or a college of further education. Under the December ruling, such students can establish ordinary residence here for the required period during their school or college course and hence qualify to receive a grant from their local education authority and to pay the home rate of fee for higher education. This change has considerable public expenditure consequences, and the Government therefore wish to restore the situation broadly to what it was before the 16th December judgment, in particular for this group of students.<lb/>
It is, however, necessary to ensure that we do so within the provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976. This Act, which was enacted under a Labour Administration, recognised that, although people who have demonstrated that they are properly settled here should be treated equally and enjoy equal access to benefits, it is unnecessary to bestow the same benefits on those who come here for a limited and temporary purpose. Section 41 of the Act therefore contains provisions which allow actions that would be discriminatory to be treated as though they were not. It has been used since the Act came into effect to allow higher fees to be charged to overseas students. Under Section 41(1), acts done under statutory authority are not to be regarded as discriminatory. Under Section 41(2), discrimination on the basis of nationality, ordinary residence or period of residence is permitted where such discrimination takes place in pursuance of arrangements made with ministerial approval.<lb/>
Because the rules of eligibility for mandatory awards are statutory, they are automatically exempted from the provisions of the Act under the provisions of Section 41(1). It was therefore possible for the Government to amend the rules to achieve the desired effect by amending the relevant regulations. Those amendments are contained in the Education (Mandatory Awards) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1983, which were laid before the House on 30th March.<lb/>
The two other ways in which overseas students have been treated differently have been covered by arrangements for the charging of differential fees and the
<col>636</col>
adoption of particular rules of eligibility for discretionary awards. These arrangements are made under Section 41(2), which allows Ministers to legitimate discrimination related to ordinary residence. Such arrangements can, however, no longer be made to serve this purpose because they depend on the test of ordinary residence. The Government therefore decided to legislate to give statutory authority to the charging of higher fees to overseas students and to the adoption of limited rules of eligibility for discretionary awards.<lb/>
The Bill creates two new regulation-making powers. We are proceeding in this way primarily because of the need to consult with the local authority associations and with a wide variety of other bodies about the detailed provisions of the regulations. We have specified that the negative resolution procedure should apply to such regulations because in present circumstances it must be possible, if the need arose, for the regulations to be made and to come into operation while Parliament is not sitting. The noble Baroness, Lady David, will, however, know that even in the very short time available before the Dissolution we have done our best to produce a first draft of the regulations to be made under Clause 1 and to give the spokesmen for other parties the fullest possible insight into our thinking on the content of regulations to be made under the Bill.<lb/>
Clause 1 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring or authorising the charging of higher fees to those who lack the necessary connection with the United Kingdom that will be specified in the regulations. The basic test will continue to be ordinary residence, but exceptions will be specified to allow European Community students to be treated as home students for the purposes of fees, and to exclude from treatment as home students those who have been in Britain only or mainly for the purpose of receiving full-time education.<lb/>
It is our firm intention that the regulations should not exclude from home fee status anyone who would have been entitled to it before the December judgment, and in some significant and, I hope, welcome respects we have proposed that the regulations should be more generous in this respect than the situation which obtained previously. These are, first, that we propose to grant home fee status to the children of immigrants accepted for settlement from the moment of their arrival in this country. This will help to ensure that they are able to take full advantage of those parts of our education system which charge fees on the same basis as home students. Secondly, we propose that entitlement to pay the home rate of fee should not be affected if the student has not been ordinarily resident in this country as required only because the student, his spouse or his parent was temporarily employed outside the country. We recognise that temporary employment abroad may, like an elephant, be difficult to define, but we believe that it is nevertheless an animal that you recognise when you see it. We believe that these arrangements will be helpful to many who are working abroad, often in the interests of this country and its trade and industry.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0326"/>
<col>637</col>
Thirdly, we propose that the regulations should not authorise the continuation of the present practice in some institutions of charging differential fees for board and lodging to overseas students (except in the limited circumstances where some colleges, usually the former teacher training colleges, provide the mandatory award student with free board and lodging in lieu of an element in his grant). The differential charge to overseas students that is involved is much resented and has been very actively campaigned against. The Government understand the reasons why these practices have developed, and, indeed, the voluntary colleges which are Exchequer-financed have kept in step with them. But it is clear that only minimal additional income results from them. The removal of the differential may actually help to achieve the economic use of residential accommodation by encouraging some overseas students to take up residence. Finally, we propose that home fee status should be granted to refugees, asylees, their spouses and children from the moment of their arrival in this country.<lb/>
Clause 2 similarly allows the Secretary of State to make regulations that will in turn allow various bodies that make discretionary awards to students for education, training or research to adopt rules of eligibility for those awards that confine them to applicants with the specified connection with the United Kingdom. The preparation of these regulations is at a less advanced stage, but it is envisaged that they will allow award-making bodies to make rules similar to those that now apply to mandatory awards, to exclude students who have been in Britain only or mainly for the purposes of full-time education. We shall also continue the present practice of allowing home student status for refugees and asylees, those temporarily employed abroad and the children of European Community migrant workers.<lb/>
My Lords, I hope I have said enough to satisfy your Lordships that there is an urgent need for this Bill, and that the Government's approach to the regulations to be made under it is fair and not ungenerous. I hope that your Lordships will give the Bill a Second Reading. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02854">6.43 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02855"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the Minister for his full and fast exposition of this Bill&#x2014;we clearly are in a great hurry today&#x2014;and, indeed, for his explanation about the draft regulations, too. I should also like to thank him and his officials for having sent me a copy of the draft regulations. We on these Benches will give support to the Bill now that certain assurances have been given, although, as I have warned the noble Earl, I shall have one or two questions to ask.<lb/>
It would be fair to say, I think, that the need for clarification of the definition of an overseas student and of the phrase "ordinarily resident" has been seen for some time, as witness the court cases which finally led up to the Law Lords' judgment last December. What caused the pressing need for a firm definition was the consternation and difficulty created when the
<col>638</col>
Government announced, in November 1979, that in future overseas students would have to pay full cost fees. Since then the need for awards has grown. There has been much uncertainty in institutions and in local authorities, as well as among students, and indeed considerable hardship for many of the students. The letter bags of MPs have been full of cases their constituents wish taken up. In spite of this, and in spite of the Select Committee for Education and Science warning the Secretary of State that we needed a new definition and that if he waited upon the courts there would be a delay of two to three years, no action was taken. The courts were waited on, and there was a delay, as predicted, of two and a half years.<lb/>
Then, in December 1982 came the Scarman ruling, which I take it is accepted by all parties. That caused consternation and disarray among Ministers and in the department. But why, my Lords? Why had it not been foreseen as a possibility? Why were they not prepared for it? Were they so confident of their own legal advice? After all, either the old "real home" definition, as under the Karminski ruling, would have been accepted and the lower court's ruling upheld, or it would not and the more commonsense definition, the "natural and ordinary" meaning, accepted. And this is what happened.<lb/>
I want to ask, first: why were not Ministers prepared for this second possibility? Secondly, since the judgment was last December, why did it take three and a half months before a Statement on mandatory awards was made on 30th March, and four and a half months before this Bill that we are dealing with today was introduced? Was there prolonged discussion and disagreement on the possibility of getting retrospective legislation through Parliament? One can only speculate, and I fear the Minister will not tell us. But there is no doubt that the Government have been guilty of both dilatoriness and incompetence.<lb/>
Having delayed and having procrastinated, suddenly at the end of April Ministers were in a hurry this Bill was read a first time on 21st April. The usual time gap of a week and two weekends between First and Second Reading was not honoured, and the Second Reading took place on 27th April, with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary introducing the Bill saying:
<quote>"This Bill is an urgent measure";</quote>
&#x2014;and, a little later:
<quote>"I hope the House will recognise the urgency of this legislation",</quote>
and,
<quote>"urgent action is also necessary".</quote>
In his speech today the Minister mentioned the need for hurry. I suppose the prospects of a June election made ministerial minds concentrate wonderfully, and the prospect of a 9th June election and Dissolution at the end of this week made them concentrate even more.<lb/>
This Bill is an enabling Bill. Its two clauses give the Secretary of State powers to make regulations about the charging of higher fees and discretionary awards. Without seeing the regulations one is in the dark about the Government's intentions, as the questions asked by the Opposition parties at Second Reading made quite clear. What the Opposition was able to do, when the date of the election was announced, was to get
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0327"/>
<col>639</col>
some concessions out of the Government on the understanding that it would let the Bill be pushed through before the end of this week and receive Royal Assent on Friday. The concessions were that the Government would produce the draft regulations by 10th May, and that there should be exemptions from full-cost fees for certain categories of students. The Minister has explained these categories&#x2014;refugees and their children, and immigrants from their date of settlement. The position of those working outside the United Kingdom and the EEC is also safeguarded; these people and their children will become excepted students. These categories were all raised at Second Reading by the Opposition. We do not know what the Government would have done without the pressure, but it is certainly good to know that the commitment has been made by the Minister. A great many people will feel much happier as a result and will feel that they have been treated more fairly.<lb/>
Thinking of the speed with which these regulations were drafted, it is even more incomprehensible that the earlier delays were so protracted. When we get excuses in future discussion on Bills that regulations cannot be prepared in a hurry, we shall have a precedent to bring forward. I have a question or two on the draft regulations. Regulations 8, 9 and 10 deal with charges for board and lodging. I understand there are wide discrepancies between local authorities in the charges they make, but I guess that these regulations will not have any effect on that. It would appear not, but it seems an area that needs looking at, and I hope the Minister might give some attention to this problem. I should like to know specifically why the list of excepted students in Schedule 3, which is attached to Regulation 10, does not include all the categories described in Schedule 2. I hope we can have an explanation of this.<lb/>
As far as the Bill is concerned, Clause 1(2), which provides that the regulations may provide for exceptions, is there not only to grant such exemptions as I have already described&#x2014;for example, for refugees&#x2014;but in case a more generous policy were to be followed in the future and students from Cyprus, for instance, were, like members of the EEC, to be treated as home students. Am I right about that? I regret that under Clause 1(5) the regulations are subject only to the negative procedure, which gives little opportunity to Parliament to discuss or to make changes.<lb/>
One question on retrospection: I am not clear whether students who started on courses in 1980, 1981 and 1982 and were paying full-cost fees will be entitled to a refund of fees if they qualify under the December ruling, and, if they were eligible, to awards. What of those applications for awards that have been pending on the files of local authorities since the end of last year? If the applications were made while the Scarman ruling was law, before the Bill is passed, what is their position?<lb/>
I have one further question. If once classified as a home student, will that student remain so for the rest of the course, or could his status be changed? It would be helpful if these matters were cleared up because the situation was not at all clear from the Committee stage or Second Reading in the other place.<lb/>
<col>640</col>
I am glad that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary said that there would be full consultation on the draft regulations with the local authority associations, the unions involved and with student and welfare organisations. But I should like to ask the Minister to repeat an assurance that was given by Mr. Waldegrave as, I believe, a part of the package deal for this Bill becoming an Act this week, that if returned the Government would lay the regulations before Parliament during the first week of July.<lb/>
As I said earlier, we support the Bill with its draft regulations, but I must end by saying that we are not yet satisfied at all about the overseas student policy of the Government. The statement in February went only a very small way towards improving matters. The new money involved was only &#x00A3;25 million over a three-year period. We have had no response as yet to the Overseas Students Trust proposal that institutions should be free to charge marginal cost fees if they so wish&#x2014;a proposal the Secretary of State said he found attractive.<lb/>
The Government have made a slight move forward and the concessions in the draft regulations are further little steps in the right direction, but there is room for further and bigger strides and I hope that after 9th June we shall be in charge and able to take them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02856">6.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02857"><member>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the whole of the reason for this Bill and the fact that it had to be produced at all stems from dilatoriness on the part of the Government and, before that, from a very bad basic policy, as the noble Baroness, Lady David, said. We can be pleased and relieved that it is ending in a helpful way with a Bill produced with the maximum of good grace, as one would expect from Mr. Waldegrave.<lb/>
The Bill as it stands is acceptable if we leave aside the fact that it is an enabling Bill and that it is dependent for its implementation on regulations which are subject to the negative procedure. I think that is usually a bad thing under most legislation unless the regulations are likely not to be of great importance. In this case, where we have regulations which are always matters of public interest and public debate, it is a great pity that they are subject to the negative procedure. The excuse which the Minister produced this evening, that this was absolutely necessary because of the necessity of passing regulations when the House is not sitting, does not stand up to very much examination.<lb/>
I do not intend to ask any questions about the draft regulations that have been hurried out, for the simple reason that I have not had time to master them. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady David, for having managed to get that far. I will listen to the explanations given but, although we are aware of the necessity caused by the general election, nevertheless this is not a good way of passing important legislation. The fact that we have not been able to challenge or table amendments to the Bill is something which we on this side of the House very much regret.<lb/>
One of the outstanding failures of the Government in their policy towards education has been their failure to realise the immense amount of good that can be
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0328"/>
<col>641</col>
done by the hospitality that this country has in the past given, and could give in the future, to students from abroad. It does not cost us all that much because, in the main, its costs are merely the marginal costs. The noble Baroness, Lady David, mentioned the proposals put forward that that should be the case and that the Government should be considering it. Certainly they should be considering it as an important matter.<lb/>
We are a country whose influence and power is declining and no matter what the result of this election, the next election or the election after that, the chances are that it will go on, comparatively, declining in the world. We have certain immense advantages and certain capital which we have built up over a period of time which we can count on and which can breed for us friendship, trade and influence. Included in this capital is our educational system, our language and the fact that as a result of it we are able to be hosts to students from all over the world. They go back to their countries with, we hope, a debt of gratitude and sometimes, more often than not, happy remembrances of what has happened in this country and what they have gained from it.<lb/>
The Government went out of their way to sabotage the whole of this by their policy in a short-term, mean, pennypinching way. I am delighted that the Government have thought better of some of their approach. I do not think that the Bill by any means goes far enough. I do not think it will undo a great deal of the harm and that it has caused in many parts of the globe, including many parts of the Commonwealth, but I am delighted that the Bill goes some little way towards remedying the harm that has been done.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02859"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although I did not put my name down to speak on this Second Reading, having listened to the noble Earl who opened, to my noble friend Lady David and to the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, there are just one or two things that I should like to take this opportunity of saying.<lb/>
During the past three years it has been part of my responsibility to advise students in a Commonwealth country as to where they should pursue their further studies. I fully agree with my noble friend Lady David that the Bill does remove a slight, minuscule, amount of the damage that has been done by the Government's policy towards overseas students. Indeed, that minute amount of progress made in the Bill has largely been made as a result of the bargain struck with the Opposition.<lb/>
I should like the noble Earl who is presenting this Bill, when replying to the Second Reading debate, to tell us whether this represents any change and any future new intentions on the part of the party which he represents, towards the opportunities that are to be given to overseas students in this country. The reason why I ask this is that I have been in the embarrassing position of wanting to suggest to students, particularly university students and teaching students, that they should obtain their higher training in institutions in this country. I have been unable to do so because the countries involved have simply been unable to afford the fees, in contrast to the fees which are charged elsewhere. For example, just last year I had to agree to
<col>642</col>
a student of mine going to an American university, when I am quite sure that he would have benefited to a much greater degree, and that his country would have benefited to a much greater degree, if he had been able to obtain the fees to attend a university in this country.<lb/>
I should like to paraphrase to the noble Earl the words of one of his noble friends behind him when speaking on the Brandt Commission debate. The noble Lord, Lord Orr-Ewing, then pointed out that one of the policies that this country could follow in order to prevent what we were then debating&#x2014;namely, the infiltration and the influence of the Soviet Union and the communist <i>bloc</i>&#x2014;was to encourage students to come to this country. The Government cannot have it both ways. If they want to avoid infiltration of the ideas of the Soviet Union or any of the other communist <i>bloc</i> countries, and if they want to prevent the infiltration of those ideas into Commonwealth countries and third world countries, then they must be prepared to recognise that they must make it possible for those countries to send their students&#x2014;as they have done traditionally&#x2014;to this country.<lb/>
If they do not do so, they are actively encouraging those countries to take the cheaper way of sending their students to communist countries, to the United States of America or to other countries where the fees are drastically less. In the general case of the United States, I have found the fees to be just about half what they are in this country. It seems to me that when we are debating a Second Reading of a new education Bill, it is incumbent upon the Government to state where they stand on this issue. Their own supporters have criticised them on this; we have criticised them. They have been criticised in the educational press, in the educational institutions, and by many noble Lords in this House with long experience of academic life.<lb/>
Therefore, I should like to make a plea to the noble Earl who is to reply to this Second Reading debate to tell us&#x2014;and to tell us openly and honestly&#x2014;whether the Conservative Party and the Government which he represents have changed their minds about the importance of making it financially possible for a growing number of overseas students to come to the institutions in this country, or will they continue to charge those increased fees which they have been charging since they were elected as a Government, and thus keep out of the country many of our potential friends of the next generation who could be trained, and who in the past have been trained, in the educational institutions of Britain?</membercontribution></p>

I think the day before yesterday, who told me that the feeling in the House was rather like an end of term, with everybody taking their exams; they feel that they want to go home but they are not allowed to. Today I felt rather as though I had gone in for my report on my Government's record in education in front of the headmistress and one or two of her other staff, and been told, like everyone from school who goes for their report, that I could have done a lot better.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0329"/>
<col>643</col>
I think that both the noble Baroness, Lady David, and the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, made much about why the Government and Ministers were not prepared when the decision was taken in your Lordships' House on 16th December last. I can give two reasons for that. One is that the case for ordinary residence has for many years been considered to be the one that could govern the situation; and, secondly, thank goodness&#x0021; that in this country we have a split between the legislature and the judicature. I think that decisions taken in the courts often surprise people, and it is not a bad thing if sometimes they surprise Ministers and Governments.<lb/>
The noble Lord and the noble Baroness then went on to say that there was a delay which resulted in all this having to be rushed through at the moment, with all the election fever, and so on, that now exists. I would deny that there has been very much of a delay. After all, the judgment was delivered in your Lordships' House only on 16th December last, and that in itself is something of a date because that was just over a week before Christmas; then we were into the New Year, and even civil servants like a bit of a holiday at that time of year. That probably took us into January.<lb/>
Naturally, it took some time fully to evaluate these wide-ranging implications. The judgment itself was concerned with mandatory awards, and amending regulations concerning such awards came into effect at the end of March. It took us a little longer to consider the implications in relation to fees and discretionary awards and it is not always easy to find legislative time, either here or in another place. Despite this, a Bill was introduced in another place on 21st April. We should all have liked to be able to move faster but I really do not think that a period of four months for the consideration of such an important matter in any way constitutes an unpardonable delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02862"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the Minister will allow me, the Government had four and a half months in which to consider it. We are being left with a whole 10 days or so between the First Reading in another place and the Bill being passed here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02863"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, I take the noble Baroness's point, but these are somewhat unusual circumstances. The noble Baroness asked me a number of questions and I shall do my best to answer most, if not all, of them. She asked me what effect draft Regulation 8 would have on the widely varying charges made for residence by local authorities. This regulation does not authorise the continuation of the present practice of higher residence charges to overseas students, except in the very limited case of those colleges which provide the mandatory award student with free board and lodging in lieu of an element in his grant.<lb/>
This differential arose because local education authorities did not wish to extend to overseas students&#x2014;and, indeed, to all students from outside England and Wales&#x2014;the element of subsidy in residence charges to home students, which occurs because those charges are not expected to include various overhead items of "college-borne expenditure", such as external building maintenance
<col>644</col>
or debt charges. It is this element that has led to the wide variations in residence charges to overseas students. The regulations that we propose will not allow the practice to continue. Therefore, I can say that although local authorities will still obviously have various differing charges at establishments of further education, the overseas students will be in the same boat as our own students in regard to the fees they pay.<lb/>
The noble Baroness then asked me why the list of excepted students in Schedule 3, which goes with Regulation 8, was not as all-embracing as in Schedule 2, which goes with Regulation 7. I am most grateful that the noble Baroness and her colleagues have very helpfully agreed to accelerate the passage of the Bill so that it may receive the Royal Assent before Dissolution. The Government are grateful, and many outside this House will also be glad, to have the present state of uncertainty resolved. To facilitate the Opposition's consideration of the Bill in the limited time available, we have produced, considerably faster than they would normally have seen the light of day outside the department, an early draft of part of the regulations to be made under the Bill. Inevitably they have been prepared in some haste, and Schedule 3 is, I am afraid, the result of that. I am happy to assure the noble Baroness that the list of excepted students for Regulation 8 will include the same list of excepted students as for Regulation 7. So that a slight mistake has been made has been due purely to the haste to get out the draft.<lb/>
The noble Baroness then asked me two questions. She asked whether students who under the Scarman judgment would have been entitled to be looked on as home students and pay home fees in the years 1980, 1981 and 1982 would be able to claim refunds. The Government are taking no action in relation to the current academic year and earlier years, and legal liability in respect of fees must be determined without regard to the Bill. Circumstances will vary widely among students, institutions and authorities. Individual cases will have to be considered on their own facts. It should not be assumed that there is any general principle that imposes an obligation or a liability on authorities or institutions to refund any part of fees previously paid. Even where a student establishes entitlement to a mandatory award for 1982&#2013;83, or any earlier year, he does not thereby establish entitlement either to a refund of fees paid for that year in excess of the then current home rate of fee, or to pay the home rate of fee in 1983&#2013;84 and subsequent years. Whether the student should be expected to pay overseas fees still outstanding for the current academic year will depend on the circumstances of individual cases.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked me, what about students who applied for awards after December 1982? So far as mandatory awards are concerned&#x2014;and these are not the subject of this Bill&#x2014;the regulations were amended with effect from 31st March, to minimise the number of students obtaining an uncovenanted and unintended benefit as a result of the December judgment. Students who were refused an award before that date can ask to have that decision reviewed, but overseas students whose applications are decided under the amended regulations will not be eligible for awards. As my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State explained in another place, it
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0330"/>
<col>645</col>
would be wrong to let more awards be made than was unavoidable on a basis which was contrary to long-established policy on access to mandatory awards. Those who fail to obtain awards as a result of the amending regulations have not been hard done by. Until the December judgment they had no expectation of obtaining an award. Those who obtained an award as a result of that decision should rather count themselves lucky to have received an unexpected bonus.<lb/>
So far as discretionary awards are concerned, until regulations under this Bill come into effect, local authorities and other award-making bodies must operate under the law as it stands in relation to any awards which they bestow in that period. They might otherwise render themselves open to accusations of unlawful discrimination under the Race Relations Act 1976 for acting outside the scope of the cover provided by the existing arrangements approved under Section 41(2). It would not perhaps be very surprising if they felt inhibited by this, and they might, for example, feel obliged to delay decisions on awards, which would cause inconvenience to students and others. But this is a matter for them. Once regulations under the Bill come into effect, local authorities will be free to return to their previous practices when deciding to whom they wish to give discretionary awards.<lb/>
The noble Baroness then asked me about students from Cyprus and whether under the provisions of Clause 1(2) relating to exceptions, they might at some future date he treated as home students like those from the EEC. It would technically be possible for the subsection to be used in this way. But my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, in his Statement in another place on 8th February, made clear that the Government's intent is to aid such students through the aid programme, not by conceding home fee status. The Government's proposals for this were contained in the document entitled, <i>A Policy for Overseas Students,</i> deposited in the Library in February. I should like to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Hatch of Lusby, that the Government want to encourage overseas students to come here, and they want to help them to do so for humanitarian and various other reasons, in both their interests and the interests of this country.<lb/>
The additional programme of assistance announced by my right honourable friend in February in response to the work of the Overseas Students' Trust, worth up to an extra &#x00A3;20 million in a full year, will help us to
<col>646</col>
develop a carefully targeted programme of assistance, rather than the indiscriminate and uncontrolled subsidy we could no longer afford. I think that I have answered all the questions that have been raised during this Second Reading debate.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Health and Social Services and Social<lb/> Security Adjudications Bill [H.L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02877">Bill returned from the Commons earlier this day agreed to with amendments.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02881"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to speak briefly on the Question that the Commons Amendments be now considered. It seems to me that it would have been quite impossible for your Lordships to have agreed that Question had it not been for the indefatigable work, far beyond the call of duty, which has been done far into the night, and indeed, to the best of my knowledge, right through the night, by those ladies and gentlemen who work in the Public Bill Office. They have worked all night to get this vast array of amendments ready for us. Sometimes we take a little too much for granted the work which is done for us in your Lordships' House, and it is right to place on record our gratitude to those people before we agree to this Question, to which we could not have agreed had it not been for the work which has been done on our behalf.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02882"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to be wholly associated with the words of the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-02884">On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02885" align="center"><b>COMMONS AMENDMENT</b></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02886"><b>1</b> Clause 1, page 2, line 29, at end, insert "or Part II of Schedule 8 to the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983".</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02887"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1. In order to afford your Lordships the maximum convenience in this matter, I propose to speak once only, on the first amendment, and then, if your Lordships agree, to move the remainder <i>en bloc.</i> It is now three months since this Bill passed from your Lordships' House to another place. During that time Members of the other place have devoted much time and energy to the discussion of your Lordships' proposals and, as is evident from the list before you, quite a number of amendments have been proposed.<lb/>
Although with 133 amendments, the list may at first sight appear formidable, I can assure your Lordships that the majority of these are either necessary technical changes, or introduce minor refinements which I believe improve what we had already agreed was a welcome and useful Bill, and I should therefore be surprised if your Lordships found these changes objectionable.<lb/>
<col>648</col>
Of the more significant changes, a number were introduced in response to suggestions put forward by your Lordships, but which time did not permit us to include before the Bill passed to another place. Perhaps the most important changes which have been made to the Bill since it left this House relate to legislation in the child care field. Your Lordships will remember our lengthy debate on the question of parental rights resolutions and access to children in care. I am pleased to say that the Government were able to bring forward amendments that we believe made significant improvements in both these areas.<lb/>
I turn now to Clause 6 concerning the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work. This was amended in Committee in another place to remove the requirement of central and local government to provide mandatory grants for the training of social workers. Your Lordships will recall that this requirement was inserted in the Bill in this House on an amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Faithfull but against the Government's advice. In Committee in another place my honourable friend the Minister for Health reiterated the arguments that I put to your Lordships. I shall therefore not detain your Lordships by repeating all the points previously made.<lb/>
My noble friend Lady Faithfull argued that residential care was the area in which more training was most needed. My honourable friend the Minister was able to describe in another place a number of substantial developments, both current and potential, which, with Government assistance, are directed at more and better training for people working in residential care. My noble friend has discussed these with my colleague, another Parliamentary Secretary, at the DHSS, and I understand that she has acknowledged that these represent a significant contribution specifically directed at residential care.<lb/>
Equally, we acknowledge my noble friend's point that training for the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work for which the proposed mandatory grants were intended is important for a proportion of people occupying key positions in the running of residential care establishments. We also acknowledge that an important group among those seeking CQSW training generally are the more mature post-graduate students. I am therefore glad to be able to tell your Lordships that the number of grants to be offered this year by the DHSS for such people shows a significant increase. Last year, some 716 new grants were taken up. This year, the number of grants that we shall offer shows an increase on this figure of more than 10 per cent. Ideally, we should like to be able to do far more to promote the training of those who work with vulnerable people; but I believe that in our current financial circumstances, the measures I have described represent a balanced package, preferable to an indiscriminate requirement to provide mandatory grants.<lb/>
Your Lordships will no doubt remember that when we considered Clause 11 in Committee in December last year the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, successfully moved an amendment to remove the reference to "means" in the first subsection of the clause. I understand that she felt that the requirement on local authorities to have regard to the means of all those
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0332"/>
<col>649</col>
charged for day and domiciliary services was a punitive provision that would prove unacceptable to those using such services. On that occasion, I resisted the amendment which I felt undermined the Government's intention to introduce consistency for the various powers under which local authorities may make charges and to protect those on low incomes. I still believe that the clause as it passed from your Lordships' House was unsatisfactory but the Government have accepted the force of the noble Lady's argument. We think that in Amendments Nos. 13 to 15, 109 to 111 and 122, incorporated in another place, we have provided a much improved clause which meets both the concern of the noble Lady and achieves what the Government want. It does not require a means test for all those who pay charges. I hope that your Lordships will agree that the Government have provided a statutory formula for charging by local authorities for their day and domiciliary services which meets the concern expressed in this House last December about fairness. It was welcomed by Members on both sides in the other place when debated in Committee there.<lb/>
Your Lordships will wish to know that the Government have reluctantly agreed that Clause 8 and the related Schedule 4 which conferred employing authority status on family practitioner committees should for the most part be left out of the Bill because of the controversial nature of the proposals. This accounts for Amendments Nos. 9 and 10, 58 to 64, 68 to 70, 74 and 75, 96, 97, 102, 103, 105 to 107, 119 to 121, 126 to 128 and 133.<lb/>
Finally, I can perhaps mention that Amendments Nos. 79, 81, 84, 86 and 91 restore the position for nominating members of tribunals and ensure that the existing rights of nomination enjoyed by the TUC and the CBI are maintained. This was a matter of particular concern to noble Lords opposite and their right honourable and honourable friends in another place.<lb/>
Those parts of the Bill to which I have not yet referred remain substantially unchanged. They include the provisions to promote community care in children's regional planning, the abolition of the teaching designation for health authorities, the fees for notification of infectious diseases and the abolition of a number of advisory bodies that have outlived their usefulness. These are all provisions that were broadly welcomed by your Lordships, who will be pleased to note that they are for the most part in the same form as when they passed for consideration in another place. I have not covered all the amendments on the list. I have already stated that the majority are of a minor or technical nature. I shall of course be happy to try and answer any detailed points that your Lordships may wish to raise.<lb/>
I conclude by thanking noble Lords for their valiant efforts in framing the main structure of the Bill when it went through your Lordships' House originally. I thank noble Lords again for facilitating its rapid progress to the statute book tonight.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02888">Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Trefgarne.</i>)</p>
<col>650</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02889">7.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02890"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to follow the example of the Minister and speak not only to Amendment No. 1 but also to the other 132 amendments before us. This is no way for important legislation to be dealt with. A Bill that affects so many thousands of our people should have received more thought and more concern. In fact, I would have preferred that the Bill had been allowed to fall, so that whichever Government come into power next month could have begun again and looked at matters in detail.<lb/>
This is an important Bill. We have stated at earlier stages that it covers too many disparate subjects and that it is too much of a portmanteau Bill. I remind your Lordships that it covers the question of access to children in care, the problem of secure accommodation for children in Scotland, the registration of residential and nursing homes, the constitution of family practitioner committees, the amendment of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978, the dental practitioners whose registration is suspended, charges for local authority services, social security adjudications and calculation of assets. All these are matters that were not properly resolved and that should have received further consideration.<lb/>
I appreciate the difficulties of the situation. However, the fact that one received only today a copy of the amendments from the Commons in a rather variable presentation, some of it illegible, makes it difficult for us to deal with the various amendments. I should like to say with emphasis that I have every sympathy with the staff who have been hard pressed and who have been put in an impossible position in presenting 133 amendments that were only passed by the Commons last night. I do not blame the calligraphy of any of the staff or the mischievous misrepresentations of the photocopying machinery that appear from page to page. But this is a serious matter. There might be a risk of error when these things are put into legislation arising out of problems of typography and calligraphy. This is not the way in which Parliament should behave in dealing with laws that will affect so many of our people in so many ways.<lb/>
I am not going to take a Trappist vow, but I am sure that the noble Minister will be glad to hear that I do not intend to speak again about the Bill. I believe that the House has been treated with such disrespect and the whole of this legislation so downgraded that it would be impossible and useless for us to try and make any further improvements tonight. It is with deep regret that I have to say these things. I appreciate the difficulties. Just because there has to be a cut and run election, we have the Bill thrust upon us in this incomplete and ill-thought-out way. It is especially discourteous to this House because the Bill started in this House. We spent a great deal of time, as the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, will painfully remember, on trying to get the Bill right.<lb/>
We have received 133 amendments back from another place and we are supposed just to roll it all up tonight. If the Bill is important it would have been better for it to have been left on one side for a new beginning. But because the Government prefer to rush it out of the way to suit their electoral ambitions, I can
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0333"/>
<col>651</col>
only hope that we will be sitting on other sides of this noble House after 9th June and then we will be able to put right some of the things which are wrong in this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-02891"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join with the noble Baroness, Lady Jeger, in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, for dealing with this very complicated list of amendments so very expeditiously if, indeed, the noble Baroness actually did thank the noble Lord&#x2014;I think she did so. However, if the noble Baroness did not do so, I certainly do.<lb/>
I am bound to say that these are very complicated amendments. I could not honestly say that I understand them fully or even that I have made a very serious attempt as yet to understand them all fully. But I say straightaway that I have personally no wish at this stage to impede the further progress of this Bill. It does a number of things which are valuable and which perhaps ought to be done. Let me say in passing that I am a little sorry that the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Faith full, has gone, although I am glad to hear that the Government have gone some way towards meeting the points which the noble Baroness raised. I am also a little anxious about the disappearance of various matters to do with the new structure for the family practitioner committees. I think in part that there may well be difficulties which may arise later as a result of that.<lb/>
But having said all that, I am bound to say that I must follow the example of the noble Lord and deal with all the amendments briefly. The noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, will recollect that when we were dealing with another matter for which he was responsible only a few minutes ago&#x2014;the Dentists Bill&#x2014;we reminded your Lordships' House that we get a Dentists Bill every 30 years. Few of us will still be here when the next Dentists Bill arrives. I would venture to suggest that there are one or two matters in this particular Bill which may have to be dealt with much sooner than in 30 years, and while I would not impede the progress of this Bill and do not wish to oppose any of these particular amendments, it is only right to say that there are those of us in your Lordships' House who may feel that we shall want to use what devices are open to us on another occasion perhaps to make further amendments by means of amending legislation of one kind or another should the need prove to be there when we have given the whole matter the degree of study which it deserves. In the meantime, I thank the noble Lord for dealing with the whole matter as expeditiously as he has done and I shall try to do likewise myself.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Copyright (Amendment) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03162">7.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03163"><member>Viscount Colville of Culross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. This is the first of the Private Members' Bills before your Lordships this evening. It is a simple Bill which I think will not bring any wrath upon my head from any quarter of the House. It was piloted through another place by my right honourable friend the Member for Bournemouth, West, and I suppose it will go down as the last of his parliamentary activities because he is not standing again. I am glad, therefore, that with the cooperation of noble Lords opposite it has been agreed that we can take this Bill through and put it on the statute book.<lb/>
I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Willis, who, last Friday, in a debate on his Bill on not dissimilar subjects, reminded the House about some of the problems of copyright infringement through piracy. He was talking mainly about music and the record industry and he mentioned a loss to legitimate interests of some &#x00A3;3 million per annum. This Bill is really about video-recordings, but it is an equally serious subject.<lb/>
I should at this stage declare an interest in the matter which I hope will not be thought in any way to disqualify me from pursuing the legislation. I am a director of a large group of companies which includes companies which make programmes, some of which go on to video; another subsidiary processes video tapes; and yet another has numerous outlets for them for retail sale and hire in the high streets.<lb/>
It was my noble friend Lord Lyell who reminded us last week that the Government intend a comprehensive review of copyright law. I suppose that they are not going to do that today and tomorrow and so we will now have to look forward to the next Parliament for them to pursue this worthy ambition. However,
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0343"/>
<col>671</col>
there is one of the two urgent matters upon which the Whitford Committee made recommendations in March 1970 with which we can now deal&#x2014;namely, the intention to increase penalties under the existing Section 21 of the Copyright Act 1956. The Government in the 1981 Green Paper agreed with that recommendation and they said that they accepted the need for stiffer penalties against those who knowingly deal with infringing products, and they hoped that that would be an effective deterrent. It needs to be an effective deterrent. London has the unenviable reputation at the moment of being the piracy capital of the world and that is not something of which we should be proud.<lb/>
The British Videogram Association, which is the commercial side of this matter, estimate that they lose at the moment about &#x00A3;120 million per annum in revenue. That does not say anything about the royalties that are lost by a multiplicity of artistes and production companies; nor does it say anything about the reduction in the already fragile cinema audiences. Then of course the taxpayer loses in the form of taxes unpaid and VAT unpaid. There is even an employment aspect, because in the last two years the legitimate video industry has taken on no less than 20,000 people into new jobs. Therefore, that also is something that we would wish to encourage and not see undermined by the influx of the pirates' trade.<lb/>
By all accounts the infringement of this copyright is big business. The theft&#x2014;and that is what it is&#x2014;of the intellectual property protected by copyright is now a major criminal activity. In the United Kingdom it can at present be embarked upon without any real risk at all. In the United States&#x2014;and I have translated this into rough sterling figures at the current rates of exchange&#x2014;the maximum penalty is &#x00A3;160,000 or five years' imprisonment; in France it is &#x00A3;3,000 or two years' imprisonment; in Holland it is just over &#x00A3;6,000 or six months' imprisonment; in Italy it is &#x00A3;3,750 or three years' imprisonment&#x2014;and that is all for the very first offence when an offender comes before the court for making a counterfeit tape. In this country under the Copyright Act, even with the amendments just brought in last month by the Criminal Justice Act of last year, the maximum fine is &#x00A3;200. Only summary proceedings are available in the magistrates' court. I may say that until April the maximum fine was &#x00A3;25, and even if there was more than one offence the total maximum was only &#x00A3;50.<lb/>
It is perhaps therefore not surprising that in the last six months of 1982 there were only two police raids and seizures of counterfeit tapes. Penalties as derisory as that simply did not warrant the use of scarce police manpower. Therefore, the object of this Bill is to deal with the penalties, and I shall come on to that in a moment. Before that I should mention two other possible remedies which have been available to some extent.<lb/>
First of all, action has been able to be taken by trading standards officers under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. An offence under that Act carries a maximum fine of &#x00A3;1,000 for the summary offence, and unlimited fines and/or two years' imprisonment on indictment. That is a little more formidable. The problem, however, is that an offence under that Act is almost certainly only committed if the cassette is
<col>672</col>
packaged in such a way as to mislead the buyer into thinking that it is being marketed by a reputable company with the authority of copyright owners, and up to the standards required by such people. That is not very easy to prove, and it is comparatively easy to avoid if you know about it and wish to see that you do not get into trouble under the Trade Descriptions Act. In any event, one might think that it is perhaps not primarily for those most useful local authority officials, the trading standards officers, to be in the frontline of a fight on something which is now a matter of major organised crime.<lb/>
Then, again, there is the possibility of action in the civil courts. You can go to the High Court for what is called an Anton Piller order, so-called after the German company which was the plaintiff in the case in which this remedy was first, in the middle of the last decade, fully discussed. An Anton Piller order, particularly coupled with an action for damages for breach of copyright, enables premises to be entered and goods seized in order that they should be available for the hearing of the case in the action for damages. But, again, there is a problem, because the courts have said from time to time and again recently that this remedy should be used only in extremely serious cases. The fact of the matter is that they have not been able to use it in a way that would make it possible to wipe out entirely this evil activity.<lb/>
The people concerned have brought cases before the civil courts. There have been a number of Anton Piller orders made, and again in the last six months of last year they obtained, or think that they are likely to obtain, about &#x00A3;300,000 in damages. But of course the trouble is that the investigation costs and legal fees have cost them nearly twice as much as that, and in any case it is only the tip of the iceberg because they have only thought fit to use these cases against major counterfeiters and have in no way attempted to go for the retailer of these counterfeit tapes.<lb/>
Hence we have this Bill. It breaks down the offences which are already in Section 21 of the Copyright Act&#x2014;and there is an amendment of it&#x2014;into two. In the case of the first group, which is confined to the less serious offences such as possessing counterfeit tapes, or having them available to hire or to sell, or exhibiting them, there will now be a liability for a fine of up to &#x00A3;1,000&#x2014;that is what the formula in the Bill currently means, and of course it can now be amended without legislation every time&#x2014;together with the possibility of two months' imprisonment. That is for each offence for each illegal copy sold, possessed, and so on. Therefore, even in the hands of the magistrates there is a very significant change indeed from the present situation.<lb/>
For the more serious offences the trial can still be summary, and in that case the maximum penalties would be the same; but either the prosecution, or, indeed, the magistrates themselves if they think that it is a serious case, can ensure that the matter goes before the Crown Court. If it is dealt with on indictment or by referral to the Crown Court there is now to be an unlimited maximum fine together with, or as an alternative to, two years' imprisonment. The offences to which this applies are those of making illegal copies of video cassettes for sale. By that I do not include those who just make one in the home, although that is
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0344"/>
<col>673</col>
in fact illegal. This applies to those who make them for sale. The other offence is importing such illegal counterfeit cassettes into the United Kingdom other than for private use, and for distributing for trade or other purposes prejudicial to the owner of the copyright such imported cassettes.<lb/>
It is the second group to which Clause 2 really applies, because there is this one extra matter in the Bill: the power of search in the case of one of these more serious offences, and the power to seize matters that are found in the course of a search. That can only he done on the warrant of a magistrate if he is satisfied on sworn evidence that there are reasonable grounds for believing that one of these serious offences has been committed, or is about to be committed, and that evidence of this will be found on the premises concerned. In Scotland the sheriff is similarly placed to issue a warrant on the same terms.<lb/>
Thus, in practice, there will be a severe restriction upon the use of this power, which I know full well Members of this House do not look upon with great favour unless a good case is made out for it. But, of course, in the circumstances it has proved necessary in the past to make such searches either under the Trade Descriptions Act or under the civil law, and I believe I can persuade your Lordships that the Copyright Act itself ought to provide the proper provisions for it. But it will not be used to deal with the retail shops because there it is intended that the existing powers under the Trade Descriptions Act will be quite adequate, as they have been before, and the trading standard officers will be able to continue to deal with it.<lb/>
It is the belief of those who support this Bill that it will put real teeth into the law and provide proper safeguards. I hope, therefore, that it may now quickly be allowed to complete its parliamentary passage so that it can come into force, as it itself says at the end, on 13th July. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03164">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Viscount Colville of Culross.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03165">7.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03166"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, not for the first time the House will be grateful to the noble Viscount for the lucid manner in which he has introduced an important measure. I find myself in a somewhat original and unique position standing up at this Dispatch Box, because while agreeing fully with my noble friends who have protested at the speed with which Bills have been brought before your Lordships today with an expedition remarkable in its intensity and yet somewhat dangerous in its complexities, I find myself welcoming the fact that this Bill has been dealt with speedily. Without any doubt at all it deals with an evil which is a threat to great industries in this country, to the employees in those industries, and is a measure that ought to be passed by the House with a good heart.<lb/>
Your Lordships have already heard from the noble Viscount of the losses that are being sustained. He mentioned a figure of &#x00A3;120 million and he used the word "piracy" again. He referred to a Bill which was moved by my noble friend Lord Willis which obtained a Second Reading last week. My noble friend correctly
<col>674</col>
said that he thought that "piracy" was too romantic a word to be used in connection with what is undoubtedly theft. I therefore intend to talk about robbers and not pirates. At least, I have added something to the noble Viscount's speech and from that point of view will not merely be copying what he has said.<lb/>
Without a doubt this is a field in which the criminal law has to move and with some amount of force because of the sums involved. As the noble Viscount said, this city of ours, of which we are so proud, has a new name as the centre of this robbing industry. It is a disgraceful reputation for us to have and the sooner we deal with these robbers the better.<lb/>
As the noble Viscount hinted, the civil law is not sufficient to deal with this matter. He explained very lucidly the order, which is known as the Anton Piller order. To add to what he has already said, the judges have made it quite clear that those orders can only be obtained in exceptional circumstances. I am using the phrase that I believe was used by Mr. Justice Whitford. It has also been made clear in some cases that these matters are more properly dealt with in the Crown Court than in the civil court, and it was a civil Chancery Judge who said it. The onus is upon us to deal with this matter and to see that proper penalties are imposed. That is what the Bill does.<lb/>
I have only one other set of observations to make and they will be brief. My noble friend&#x2014;as I call him without any difficulty&#x2014;the noble Viscount, referred to the seizure section of this Bill when, after a warrant has been issued, it is possible for documents and goods to be seized.<lb/>
There was a Bill of which some of your Lordships may have heard. It was called the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill. Your Lordships may have remembered that never were their postbags so full as when that Bill came before another place. I do not intend to discuss the demerits of that Bill at this stage, because it has died a decent death. It would not have lived a decent life had it survived, but Clause 14, as amended, in that Bill made it perfectly clear that when the police exercise their rights of seizure of documents they could not seize documents that were privileged as between a legal adviser and a client.<lb/>
When this Bill was before another place, under the able pilotage of Sir John Eden&#x2014;whose passing from parliamentary life is a matter of regret, regardless of political allegiances&#x2014;representations were made to him on behalf of the legal profession that that Bill, of itself, did not seem to spell out the protection that ought to be given to these legal privileges. Sir John Eden correctly said that we should look at Clause 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill to find that it would cover the situation when it becomes an Act. As we know it is not to become an Act and therefore one has to look rather carefully at these rights of seizure to make absolutely sure that the common law situation on privilege in relation to legal documents is not being defeated.<lb/>
The last thing in the world that I want to do on behalf of my noble friends is to impede the passage of this Bill in any way. Normally, if I had had more time, I would have put down an amendment. It would have been discussed and we would have decided whether
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0345"/>
<col>675</col>
that amendment was necessary to cover my point. I do not have that opportunity, for if I did avail myself of it I should be stifling the Bill. Indeed, it would be stillborn. I do not intend to do that. Instead I hope to rely on the fact that common law rights are in no way interfered with by the Bill, that this exception does stand and because of other legislation that the noble Viscount mentioned&#x2014;which clearly one thinks retains the right of privilege&#x2014;that this would apply to this Bill. It would help if on the record the noble Viscount and the noble Minister were able to say that they were both sure that this point was covered.<lb/>
If we find that somewhat unfortunately a case emerges in which the noble Lord and the noble Viscount are found to be wrong, our care in this matter will be on record and possibly&#x2014;but I hope not&#x2014;some short amending Bill will have to be passed. I mention this out of abundant caution because your Lordships appreciate that the privilege which obtains between a legal adviser and his client in relation to documents is sacred in our legal tradition and one not lightly to be cast aside.<lb/>
Subject to those comments, we on these Benches welcome the Bill and express our appreciation to the noble Viscount and to the Member in another place who are both responsible for the Bill being before your Lordships tonight.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03167">7.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03168"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it only remains for me, on behalf of the Government, to reiterate everything that has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, to my noble friend Lord Colville of Culross and indeed if he would pass on the encomiums it has received and deservedly so in your Lordships' House to our right honourable friend in another place for bringing this Bill, which the Government warmly support, before your Lordships so swiftly following its very successful passage in another place.<lb/>
My noble friend pointed out and the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, reminded us of what happened last Friday when we discussed video piracy, but the situation is much more serious and less glamorous than that. Video piracy has seen a phenomenal growth in the past two or three years and we understand that about two-thirds of the videograms&#x2014;which I understand is the trade name for pre-recorded video tapes&#x2014;on the sale and rental market in this country are now pirate copies. The outcome of this extraordinary level of criminal activity is that some &#x00A3;120 millions each year is lost to the legitimate film and video industry and, above all, to those whose creative skill and energy result in the products on which that industry is based. Correspondingly there are fewer funds to be ploughed back into new productions, which is a serious threat to jobs, and it is also a threat to the production of new films&#x2014;all this at a time when there is a great and notable resurgence of the British film industry, as witness the two examples "Chariots of Fire" and more recently "Ghandi".<lb/>
The Government see this Bill as one of two measures which complement one another. In the one measure are the very substantial increases, which were mentioned in customary detail by my noble friend, in the penalties that offenders who are found guilty of film or record copyright offences will face. It has long
<col>676</col>
been recognised that the penalties which are currently available for offences against the Copyright Act 1956 are inadequate. The Copyright Green Paper, published in 1981, that many of us have discussed, stated that the intention of the Government was to increase the penalties to make them effective deterrents. The sudden and, as it is now seen to be, unforeseeable explosion in video piracy has demanded that this problem receives immediate and urgent attention in advance of the general reform of copyright. As my noble friend has pointed out, under the Bill the penalties will become very severe and, as a result of this, we can look forward to a turning of the tide against the video pirates as the deterrent influence of these very heavy penalties takes effect.<lb/>
The Government also strongly support the Bill's second provision giving the police the powers necessary to detect and pursue video and record pirates. This provision strikes, we hope, the right balance in requiring a constable to apply to a magistrate for a warrant and in granting these powers of entry only in relation to premises where it is suspected that one of the more serious offences (that is, manufacture, import or distribution) has been or is about to be committed. This will assist the police in the investigation of piracy offences. It will be for the local chief police officers to decide what resources they should allocate to these new powers. It will remain important for the film and video industry to continue to do the major part of the work of investigation and collection of evidence.<lb/>
To digress slightly, I think the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, turned towards documents. My admirable advisers have given me a brief outline which I hope may be of some comfort to him. We understand that the legal professions welcome this Bill. They have expressed concern that the loss of the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill may mean that legally-privileged documents would become vulnerable to seizure. I acknowledge that the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill would have introduced important, specific safeguards here; but we do not think that the professions should be anxious over the privacy of their offices. This is because of the way that my noble friend's Bill is drafted. I understand that Clause 2 of the Bill provides that a justice may issue a search warrant if he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that evidence of a copyright offence is in the premises where the offence has been or is about to be committed.<lb/>
My Lords, this does not answer all the questions which have been raised. There are many questions in this particular field which have been raised by the legal professions. The Bill before the House is very limited in its aims and, in common with other, similar measures&#x2014;and one example is gaming legislation&#x2014;it gives a power to search for evidence of certain specific offences. This is a very difficult area and we would suggest that this Bill is not the place to deal with a matter of somewhat broader legal principle which should apply equally to other legislation. I myself have not entered deeply into this problem of legal search warrants especially as I have extended it in this brief addendum to my remarks on the Bill before us. I hope that this might in some way have helped in answering the point.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03169"><member>Lord Mischon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope the noble Lord will forgive me. The last thing I want to do is to burden him with a technical argument. It would be completely unfair and I do not think your Lordships would greet it with great approbation at this hour. Can he say that it is certainly the Government's intention that documents should be protected if they come under the common law privilege of documents which are between a legal adviser and his client? If he could say that it is the Government's desire that that is so and their belief that that is so, it would help in view of what I was trying to say before in an effort not to impede the progress of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03170"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was prepared to speak for a little longer to allow one of my noble colleagues to obtain advice through the traditional winged messengers. I have seen with my own eyes, and my noble friend has indicated, that there was a degree of head-nodding and that we could assure the noble Lord on that particular point. I am afraid the noble Lord has caught me totally in a field with which I am not familiar. I hope that assurance will satisfy him so far as the legally privileged documents and the privilege aspect of this Bill are concerned.<lb/>
In conclusion, the view of the Government is that this is an excellent Bill which deserves to become law. Our support for it at all stages has reflected the Government's determination to stamp out video and record piracy as well as our belief that the Bill represents a major step forward towards that objective.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03171"><member>Viscount Colville of Culross</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, for his welcome and for the Government's support in this measure. There is just one thing which I think needs dealing with and upon which I believe that I can add a little to what my noble friend has said. I am delighted to hear that that is the Government's policy, and the fact that it was in Clause 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill in general terms, applying to a very broad range of powers of search, underpins what my noble friend has said. I would put this to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, as something that I should like him to think about. There are, indeed, a fairly large number of statutes which, for limited and proper reasons, give powers of search and seizure of documents to certain persons, usually the police, where criminal offences are anticipated to have occurred.<lb/>
I mentioned one of these when I was referring to the Trade Descriptions Act. It is under that Act that so far the vast majority of the seizures of counterfeit video cassettes have been undertaken. What it says in Section 28 is that the trading standards officer:
<quote>"may seize and detain any goods or documents which he has reason to believe may be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence under this Act".</quote>
It does not say anything about them not being privileged documents. What it says in subsection (7) is that:
<quote>"Nothing in this section shall be taken to compel the production by a solicitor of a document containing a privileged communication made by or to him in that capacity &#x2026;"</quote>
In other words, in 1968, in that Act, in common with a large number of other Acts where the question
<col>678</col>
of search and seizure has been passed by Parliament, it was not considered necessary, it appears, for Parliament to do anything about the common law in relation to privileged documents on the premises of the supposed criminal. All right&#x0021; They have made a specific provision for the solicitor's own office not to be subject to these searches, but when it comes to his client in his client's own premises, it has been thought, evidently, that the common law is enough.<lb/>
That is the situation as it would apply under this Bill. I would suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, it is probably best that it should be so left, for this reason. It is one thing in Clause 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill to give this protection overall to a large number of instances under different statutes whereby privileged documents might be threatened in some way or another; but to put it in only one individual case of a large set of statutes, all of which have similar powers but all the others of which say nothing about privileged documents, would be much more likely to throw doubt on the degree of protection available under the other powers of search than it would to do anything greatly in the way of protection of the sort of documents being referred to under this Bill. In other words, it might be said that if Parliament thought that in the copyright sphere it was necessary specifically to say something about privileged documents, why on earth did it not do it in all the other legislation?&#x2014;and that would throw doubt on the protection of these sort of documents under the other legislation.<lb/>
This is an argument often raised in Parliament and the noble Lord will know it is a matter of statutory interpretation. It is something which can quite often come in front of the courts. A parliamentary inconsistency of this kind is a very dangerous thing. I am sure there will be a major outcry if anyone is so silly as to seize under these powers a privileged document, and then no doubt there will have to be legislation passed, I hope in general terms, to stop it. But as the Bill stands, and even without Clause 14, I hope that the noble Lord is somewhat reassured by my technical argument and by the policy statement we have heard from my noble friend on the Front Bench. In those circumstances, I hope that he will think it is safe for this Bill to go forward to the statute book.</membercontribution></p>

I have no wish on behalf of my noble friends to delay this legislation. It is unfortunate that we could not discuss the matter at Committee stage, but there it is, and I am most grateful for the discussion which has taken place.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03181">8.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03182"><member>Lord Cullen of Ashbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move. This brief measure was introduced in another place by the honourable member for Newbury. It is, I believe, uncontroversial. To explain what the Bill would do I must give your Lordships some background; but unless asked to do so I do not propose to go through it clause by clause. The Community Driving Licence Regulations which this House approved in October 1982 gave people who come to live in this country and hold other European Community driving licences the right to exchange them for the equivalent British driving licences. These arrangements came into force on 1st January 1983. These regulations were made under Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972.<lb/>
Owing to limitations in the enabling powers, two small groups of United Kingdom licence holders were placed at a disadvantage compared with the holders of licences issued in other Community states. One group so disadvantaged is the holders of Gibraltar licences who can now exchange their licences in every country of the Community except here in Britain. The other group consists of Northern Ireland and Ireland holders of public service vehicle drivers' licences who, unlike Northern Irish heavy goods vehicle drivers and unlike holders of vocational licences elsewhere in the Community, do not have the right of exchange in the United Kingdom. In his memorandum on the regulations to the Joint Scrutiny Committee, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport promised that this anomaly would be put right at the earliest opportunity and that is one purpose of this Bill. The other purpose is to fulfil an undertaking given by the then Secretary of State for Transport when opening the debate on the European Community Draft Directive which introduced the Community driving licence exchanges. He said he would be ready to consider extending similar exchange arrangements for cars to other countries provided, of course, their standards are satisfactory.<lb/>
I stress that he did not propose&#x2014;and nor does the Bill propose&#x2014;any extension of the present arrangements
<col>680</col>
under the directive for the exchange of vocational licences; that is, heavy goods and public service vehicle drivers' licences beyond the United Kingdom and the European Community. The Bill does not extend to Northern Ireland, but I understand that similar legislation will follow in that Province if this Bill is passed into law. I believe that the Bill is such as to be welcomed on all sides of the House, and I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03183">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014; (<i>Lord Cullen of Ashbourne.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03184"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cullen of Ashbourne, for explaining the Bill. When one had the Bill this morning for the first time it was difficult to understand exactly what were the provisions because it inserts bits and pieces in other legislation. But from the explanation of the noble Lord one can now see quite clearly the purpose of it, and I am grateful to him.<lb/>
When the Community Licence Regulations were introduced last October, I said on that occasion that any provision which eases the movement of people, assists them to work and to take up residence is to be welcomed, but at the same time I added&#x2014;and other noble Lords echoed this&#x2014;so long as there is no lessening of our effective safety standards. On that occasion, the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, made some points and gave assurances in that direction.<lb/>
I am pleased to note that the Bill not only deals with Gibraltar but when the Community Licence Regulations were introduced I recall I made the point that if the Government proposed to introduce primary legislation to deal with the position of Gibraltar, I hoped at the same time they would take the opportunity of providing for bilateral arrangements with states outside the Community. In effect, the Bill makes that provision, or the opportunity is there. I note that an amendment was put in the other place&#x2014;I do not know at what stage because there was no Second Reading debate and no Committee stage so it must have been during an abbreviated Report stage&#x2014;to provide that the Secretary of State shall have appropriate consultations before he designates other states outside the Community to which this may apply.<lb/>
I hope some care will be exercised in that and although of course this Government cannot bind the incoming Government&#x2014;which I have no doubt will be totally different&#x2014;nevertheless the Bill takes effect within two months of passing. No doubt the Government and the department will be considering steps to implement the Bill. I have no doubt that the Government will accept the Bill in view of the assurance given previously. I am sure the Government will pay careful attention to the need for the preserving of standards. The Minister, in connection with the Community Licence Regulations gave an opportunity for dealing with standards throughout the Community. As this Bill now gives the opportunity for the Secretary of State to designate countries outside the Community, there could be a problem as regards ensuring that our standards are adhered to. I hope that attention will be given to that important matter and that the Secretary of State will take it into consideration when he considers designation.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0348"/>
<col>681</col>
I regret that there appears to be no provision in the Bill for any designation by the Secretary of State to receive Parliamentary approval, even by a negative order. I assume that it is merely a designation that the Secretary of State will make. That makes it more important for attention to be given to the question of safety standards.<lb/>
I do not think I need refer to the provisions of Clause 2 as the noble Lord has made it clear that this applies solely to the position of Gibraltar regarding heavy goods and passenger service vehicles. When we look at Clause which deals with passenger service vehicle licences operating in Northern Ireland, we find that if a person has held, within the previous five years, a licence to drive a passenger service vehicle in Ireland, there need be no compliance with a condition for a passenger service vehicle test, as there is in this country.<lb/>
I assume that the licensing authority has to be satisfied that the person has held a licence in Northern Ireland for five years; but a situation could arise where a person has held a licence for only a few weeks and therefore there is no evidence of real experience in driving a passenger service vehicle. In such a situation I hope that the Secretary of State will pay careful attention to this point and that there will be an opportunity in such cases for the licensing authority to insist that there should be a test. With those minor comments. I welcome the Bill. I hope the Government will accept it and that it will come into effect within two months of its passing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03185">8.24 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03186"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think I need add more than a few words to the explanation of this measure which has been given to your Lordships by my noble friend. The present discrimination against certain United Kingdom licence-holders, to which he has referred, affects only a very few drivers. Nevertheless, this is an injustice which we would all wish to remedy as soon as possible. The initiative taken by my honourable friend the Member for Newbury and by my noble friend Lord Cullen is therefore most welcome.<lb/>
As has been explained, the Bill takes the opportunity to extend ordinary licence exchange to third countries outside the Community, subject to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State being satisfied about their driving test and other aspects of the driving licence. I envisage that there would be reciprocal arrangements with the countries concerned: in fact many countries already exchange British licences. I would underline what my noble friend said: there is no proposal to extend beyond the European Community the arrangements stemming from the Rome Treaty guarantees on free movement of workers for the exchange of vocational driving licences. In other words, there is no question of diluting our vocational licensing scheme through this Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, raised a very important point. Since he asked the question of the Government, it may be appropriate if my noble friend allows me to put the Government's point of view regarding that question. The noble Lord spoke of the amendment which the Government accepted in
<col>682</col>
another place last night. It was of course an Opposition amendment, stemming largely from the very reasonable comments made by the Royal Automobile Club that there ought to be consultation before countries outside the Community are designated for exchange of licences.<lb/>
Your Lordships may be interested to know that in the department we estimate that there are some 200 driving licence administrations in the world. These range from nation-states to colonies, provinces and so forth. There are the Australian and American states, the Canadian provinces and so on, each with its own laws. We shall need to consider very carefully which of them meet the standards set by the United Kingdom and the European Community. With the international contacts that the motoring organisations have, there is no doubt that their knowledge will add to that which the department will gather from the Governments concerned. That will enable the Secretary of State to reach an informed decision on each designation.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, referred to this. I think he would be reassured to know that in making these decisions the basic criteria would be those standards set both in the United Kingdom and in the European Community. I believe the noble Lord will appreciate that even having made the designation&#x2014;by order admittedly&#x2014;there is provision for the reversal of the same, should there be a change of circumstances in the country which has been so designated. Obviously it will not be possible to do this all at once. Countries on which we can gather sufficient information during the months before the Act comes into force will be designated subject, as we have said, to consultation and without delay. However, information on other countries may take longer and there will have to be further designations from time to time.<lb/>
The noble Lord also raised a very important point on Clause 3: the Northern Ireland licence to drive public service vehicles. May I paraphrase his question: will the licensing authority be assured that the PSV licence-holder in Northen Ireland has undertaken this kind of work for a period of five years without committing an offence? I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, and other noble Lords, will recall that passenger service vehicles drivers' licences are granted by the traffic commissioners in the same traffic areas and by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner at the Public Carriage Office in London. Their powers are based on Part II of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act of 1981, although driving licences are issued in several other United Kingdom jurisdictions. It will therefore be up to the commissioners, in considering this transfer of licence, to take account of all relevant facts. I have little doubt that the commissioners will be very much seized of the point which was made by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill. I repeat that we will attempt to ensure&#x2014;indeed we will ensure&#x2014;that there will be no lowering of standards, particularly among vocational driving licence holders.<lb/>
May I also mention that this Bill is concerned with people who become resident here. The existing international conventions will continue to cover visitors engaged in international commerce and tourism. So it is a fairly restricted Bill and is one which I wish to commend to the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03191"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. It started as a Private Member's Bill in another place, where it was introduced and piloted by my right honourable friend Mr. Norman St. John-Stevas&#x2014;an experienced and respected parliamentarian, a constitutional expert and formerly Leader of another place. The Bill concerns the House of Commons and its control over money voted in taxation. Its purpose is to ensure that the money voted by Parliament is properly and efficiently spent. It is, as your Lordships will appreciate, essentially a House of Commons matter, but it is not a Money Bill so it requires your Lordships' approval.<lb/>
The Bill is now wholly uncontroversial in party political or any other terms, and it has the support of all parties and of the Government so far as another place is concerned, and I believe in your Lordships' House as well. The drafting was ultimately carried out with the help of the Treasury. I think it is proper for me to mention that it has the support of the Comptroller and Auditor General&#x2014;that eminent official who is most affected by the Bill.<lb/>
Earlier controversy, when the Bill was first introduced, centred on the inclusion of nationalised industries and public companies owned by the Government, bringing them within the scope of the control by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the House of Commons commission which is mentioned in the Bill. But those two categories were removed from the Bill at the Committee stage, and that is what has rendered the Bill uncontroversial. The Bill received an unopposed Second Reading after no less than five hours' debate on the Floor of the House, and there was a long Committee stage, with seven sittings of two-and-a-half hours each. The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, who shares with me experience of having served in another place, will know that that is very thorough consideration in Standing Committee, and it was there that the Bill was substantially amended.<lb/>
I should point out that with, of course, the co-operation of my right honourable friend Mr. Norman St. John-Stevas, it was Treasury Ministers who made the running in the Standing Committee and got the Bill into a shape which was found to be generally acceptable to all concerned. It was originally called the Parliamentary Control of Expenditure (Reform) Bill&#x2014;if I may say so, a very apt description, because that is just about what the Bill does, although it is a rather long Short Title. However, in Committee it was
<col>684</col>
restyled the National Audit Bill, and that is what comes before us this evening.<lb/>
I think I can quickly explain its terms and effect by simply running through the first eight clauses quite briefly. Clause 1 provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be an officer of the House of Commons, instead of being appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister as a result of the proposal made in 1866 by Mr. Gladstone when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. In future, the Comptroller and Auditor General will be appointed by the House of Commons on a Motion moved by the Prime Minister, with the agreement of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, who will, no doubt, consult the committee. In this way the interests of all parties should have been taken into account. I understand that Her Majesty has signified her assent to the modification of the Royal Prerogative, and my noble friend the Chief Whip will no doubt indicate that at a later stage.<lb/>
Clause 2 establishes the House of Commons commission, including the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. The function of this commission is to approve an estimate of expenses for the National Audit Office and lay it before the House. Clause 4 is also relevant to that, as I shall show. Clause 3 sets up the National Audit Office and gives the Comptroller and Auditor General power to appoint the staff and to determine their conditions and salaries, which will be in line with Civil Service scales.<lb/>
Clause 4 lays down how the expenses of the Comptroller and Auditor General shall be defrayed and accounted for, and also points to the way in which his duties shall be discharged. In addition, it arranges for the appointment of an accounting officer, who will be appointed by the commission. Clause 5 introduces something quite fresh, and I hope that your Lordships will find it welcome. It enables audit fees to be charged when the Comptroller and Auditor General is asked to undertake a scrutiny outside the main purpose of his work. Audit fees are something which cannot, in theory, be charged at the moment but which, I understand, are in fact paid in practice when appropriate.<lb/>
Clause 6 gives statutory backing to what are best described as "value for money" audits, although if your Lordships will look at the Bill it will be seen that they are described in somewhat more technical and wide terms. The Comptroller and Auditor General, as we all well know, does this at present, but does so by convention rather than by statute. The authority given by Clause 6 applies to those departments and bodies which he does at present audit. Clause 7 provides that bodies which are mainly supported by public funds&#x2014;and the definition of "supported by public funds" is the provision of over half their income&#x2014;shall be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Of course, he has no power to question the merits of policy objectives. I should mention, in passing, that that condition applies also to his "value for money" audits under Clause 6. The point to bear in mind here is that the Government should remain responsible for broad decisions of policy, and that there should be no overlap between the Government's decisions and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is concerned
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0350"/>
<col>685</col>
only with the finances and the way in which those decisions are implemented.<lb/>
I should mention subsection (4) of Clause 7, which excludes the nationalised industries and certain public bodies from the jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Those bodies are listed in Schedule 4. As your Lordships know, those bodies have, under statute, their own arrangements for the carrying out of their financial responsibilities. Clause 8 gives to the Comptroller and Auditor General access to documents under the objective test of reasonableness. I hope that will cause no trouble about disclosure in the courts.<lb/>
Part III of the Bill is technical and consequential, and the schedules are consequential upon the first eight clauses which I have outlined; but again I should draw attention to the fact that the nationalised industries are specifically listed under Schedule 4, which derives its authority from subsection (4) of Clause 7.<lb/>
I hope your Lordships will find that explanation, brief though it is, acceptable. Accordingly, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03192">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014; (<i>Lord Renton.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03193">8.42p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03194"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we on this side of the House are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, for having moved the Second Reading of the Bill. As the noble Lord has indicated, this is not a money Bill. Therefore it is a little unfortunate that the Bill is not to receive detailed and adequate consideration by this House. We regret that it has come here at such short notice and that the emergency conditions which have arisen, through no fault of the Opposition, have resulted in agreements and arrangements being made through the usual channels for the speedy expedition of the Bill. During earlier debates today one would have thought, listening to other noble Lords, that this emergency had been thrust on the country by the Opposition, not by the Government. It is the Government's entire responsibility that our proceedings have been truncated. The Opposition did not precipitate the alleged "emergency" with which Parliament is confronted. Initially we should have liked to give further and more detailed consideration to the Bill.<lb/>
Nevertheless, I say immediately that we are grateful to the right honourable gentleman, Mr. Norman St. John-Stevas, whose sense of public duty transcends purely party considerations and whose persistence has resulted in the Bill passing ultimately through another place with the aid of his colleagues, my right honourable friend Mr. Joel Barnett and Member of all parties. Therefore we are very grateful to the right honourable gentleman, Mr. Norman St. John-Stevas, for having persisted so far and so fast in bringing this measure towards the statute book.<lb/>
A number of technical considerations arise which in the ordinary way would have required a good deal more consideration than we are able to give them today under the arrangements which have been agreed
<col>686</col>
between the parties. Perhaps I can best explain my own misgivings by referring to the Long Title of the Bill. Among other things, it refers to,
<quote>"making new provision for promoting economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of such money by government departments and other authorities and bodies."</quote>
The Long Title refers to money within the context of the promotion of efficiency, but if one refers to Part II of the Bill, Clause 6(1) reads as follows:
<quote>"The Comptroller and Auditor General may carry out examinations into the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which any department, authority or other body to which this section applies has used its resources in discharging its functions".</quote>
The reason I raise this point is because there is a world of difference between money and resources. One of the unfortunate afflictions of the British public financial system and its method of bookkeeping and accounts is that it presents its accounts in the form of a receipts and payments account only. Under the existing legislation it is not required to present an account to the public of how it uses its resources, in the largest sense. And the use of resources includes its non-monetary assets. These may include buildings, plant and machinery, and many other items.<lb/>
If one is going to determine economy, efficiency and effectiveness, one needs to look not only at the receipts and payments account but also at the resources as a whole. For that reason, I am very sorry indeed that we in this House were unable to obtain longer notice for discussion of the Bill. Had it come within the normal time tolerance of the schedule of business of the House, there is no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Benson, a distinguished chartered accountant, and the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, another distinguished accountant, as well as the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, who is also in the profession, would have had an opportunity to discuss the Bill in much greater detail.<lb/>
I hope that in due course the right honourable gentleman, Mr. Norman St. John-Stevas, and the Public Accounts Committee will read the report of our debate and that they may feel disposed to take account of these observations. As an accountant myself, I aver and insist that one cannot judge efficiency, economy and effectiveness without reviewing the position of any concern as a whole, including the utilisation of its assets. This in itself will mean, if it is to be effective, a very considerable reform of the manner by which Governments of any party&#x2014;I make no party point about it&#x2014;keep their accounts and present them to the public. It might act as a deterrent to Governments who wish to flog off assets, which have been purchased out of taxpayers' money at prices far below their cost, without the losses resulting from those transactions being disclosed to the British taxpayer. The noble Lord may think that is a partisan point. I agree that it has party overtones. Nevertheless, it remains quite true.<lb/>
It is, I believe, within your Lordships' knowledge that the Netherlands adopt a far more comprehensive system of accounting, not only in the accounts of their national Government but also in the accounts of their local authorities. As the noble Lord knows very well if he has read the Layfield report, local authorities in this country are not required to account to the ratepayers or to the public as to what happens to the assets which they own. Once again on a partisan note, had the local ratepayers been aware of the loss of ratepayers' money
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0351"/>
<col>687</col>
which had been incurred by flogging off houses at a fraction of their cost, they might have thought again about it.<lb/>
Those are only markers which ought to have been laid down and discussed at some length in this House, because they do presuppose that Part II of the Bill, to become really effective in the sense that the public is being led to presume they will be effective, will need some considerable changes in the whole system of Government accounting&#x2014;whichever party is in power. In parenthesis, by previous consultation with my colleagues in my own party, I have no reason to presume that I would not have to persuade them just as hard as I am persuading the present Government in this particular direction.<lb/>
Reform is indicated in that respect, and ancillary to that, a fundamental change is required in the Civil Service itself&#x2014;I am talking about the general administrative grades in the Civil Service&#x2014;to stop resisting (as they have so far successfully resisted) the engagement of more professional accountants to be involved in the machinery of government itself. I sincerely hope that the Public Accounts Committee will take account of that also in due course, and the comptroller too.<lb/>
Having delivered myself of those homilies, which I believe are of importance and which are fortunately within the professional competence of the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, who occupies a distinguished position in my own profession, I sincerely hope that we may have an indication from the Government that the word "resources" included in Clause 6 (1) goes far beyond money and includes all the physical and other assets. Subject to that, we on this side of the House are quite willing, in the light of the arrangements which have been made between the parties, to facilitate the passage of this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03195">8.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03196"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, from this position the Government would only wish me to congratulate my noble friend Lord Renton who has introduced the purpose of this Bill. I am sure your Lordships would wish the encomiums which have been passed on to my noble friend to be passed on to our right honourable friend in another place. Indeed, he tends to have a foot in two places because he is fortunately able to be present, albeit unofficially, at our deliberations this evening.<lb/>
The Government's view is that we approve of parts of this Bill and the spirit behind it. Your Lordships have noted that the comptroller will continue to be appointed by the Crown. But the Bill also provides that, in future, the Crown will exercise this power on an Address presented by another place. No Motion shall be made for such an address except by the Prime Minister acting with the agreement of the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. These arrangements reflect the shared interest of Parliament and the Executive in this very important appointment.<lb/>
Under the existing and long standing legislation the comptroller conducts basic financial and regularity audits. I will not go into an exact definition of the word "resources" in Clause 6 (1) because we could be here quite some time if we went into an exact definition of that word. But my noble friend Lord Renton and even
<col>688</col>
the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, would agree that the important work of the comptroller in the area of value for money has had no specific statutory authority. This Bill will give to the comptroller such authority because, in broad terms, the effect of this part of the Bill will be to provide a specific statutory basis for the value for money examinations which the comptroller and his staff already carry out in departments and certain other bodies in receipt of public funds.<lb/>
The Government have consistently supported the provisions which now make up this Bill. We regret that the proposals for value for money examinations of the nationalised industries which were put forward by my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary have not been incorporated in the Bill, because they would have provided a valuable means of improving parliamentary accountability and increasing the efficiency of those industries. The Government will now consider what can be done on a non-statutory basis in consultation with those industries. Despite the omission of these important provisions, the Government support this Bill in its present form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03197"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, sits down will he please confirm that it is the Government's attitude at the moment that they cannot define the word "resources" within this Bill?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03198"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not see the word "resources" in any of the definitions in the Bill. The noble Lord tempted me and I sparred with the word "resources". The noble Lord thought it would be all-encompassing but we do not wish to go any further in defining the noble Lord's wide spectrum of what these "resources" might be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03199"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say that I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, and to my noble friend Lord Lyell, for their contributions to this debate. We all regret short discussion on matters about which we could go on talking for a very long time. I resist the temptation to answer the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, about the exigencies of our timetable, except to say that nothing unconstitutional has occurred and that the decision to hold a general election is part of the sound working of our democracy.<lb/>
I was interested by the contrast that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, drew between receipts and payments in public expenditure and, on the other hand, the accounting or lack of accounting for resources. No doubt all concerned will take note of the noble Lord's comments, which illustrate the value of scrutiny by your Lordships even in matters which mainly concern another place.<lb/>
The noble Lord mentioned also local government audits, but they are not within the scope of this Bill. He also spoke about this question of the engagement of staff by Government departments so far as accountants are concerned. I must point out that the Bill does not deal with that. The National Audit Office&#x2014;and one should stress this&#x2014;will not be a Government department; it will be part of the structure of Parliament. Indeed, the Comptroller and Auditor General
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0352"/>
<col>689</col>
will be an officer of the House of Commons. It may be that I misheard my noble friend Lord Lyell. If I did mishear him, he must forgive me. But I think I should stress that the Comptroller and Auditor General will not be appointed by the Crown but by the House of Commons. With those few further comments, I trust this Bill will receive a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03205">8.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03206"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are now on the Third Reading of this Bill, and may I therefore take up a moment or two to comment upon it? I rather missed my opportunity on Second Reading because matters seemed to go back to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, rather quickly. It is a great pity that we have to deal with this Bill in this way. I know it is an extraordinary situation, but when important Bills get dropped in bundles of 10, the Finance Bill gets mauled about because the Opposition will not swallow it, and we have other Bills that are to be sent through your Lordships' House at high speed, it is not a very satisfactory way of dealing with the nation's affairs and not a very dignified way in which to end a Parliament. I am concerned about this on those grounds.<lb/>
This Bill has been quite a controversial one in another place and in the country, and noble Lords know that we have listened to and received representations from chairmen of nationalised industries about the provisions of this Bill. I think it has implications here which are of considerable importance. I can only speak as a one-time chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and I saw something of its working and something of the working of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. My worry about this is that it seems to create a new bureaucracy, or an additional bureaucracy, to audit business enterprise. If nationalised industries are going to remain the institutions that some of them have become, that would be a bad thing for the future of nationalised industries, but I rather fear that the audit of nationalised industries by bureaucracy is the wrong way round.<lb/>
I think that private consulting accountants particularly should be auditing bureaucracy. I am not at all sure that this Bill is going to do the nationalised industries any good. I am not at all sure that it is going to produce any satisfactory result for Parliament to consider. What the nationalised industries require are
<col>690</col>
not so much auditors as consulting accountants, as my noble friend said, to see the business enterprise as a whole and not just be grubbing around with the routine of auditing, which comprises a good deal of the job of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Those are my worries about this.<lb/>
I can understand Members of another place wanting to reassure themselves of the way in which nationalised industries use public money. After all, a good deal of public money goes into them. A great many of them have huge deficits, which are made good out of public funds, and one naturally wonders whether they are running their affairs in a proper manner. But I think there is a big difference between state enterprises which are in business, which should be observing some of the conditions of profit and loss, should be conscious of how they are satisfying their customers, should have an idea, where they are not monopolies, how they are going to compete with rival services and all that kind of thing. But that is a very different job from the Board of Inland Revenue or the Department of Health and Social Security, or the Home Office and other departments, where the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General are very largely employed.<lb/>
That is not to say for a single moment that they do not do very good work or make some very important discoveries. When I was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and we had to look into serious misgivings about the production of Blue Streak by the Ferranti company, it was an executive officer in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Department who had discovered the flaws in the costing arrangements in the firm that undertook the job, which eventually led to some very substantial refunds by the manufacturers of that particular missile.<lb/>
That is all I have to say. I do not think the Bill should just be allowed to go through, as it were, on the nod when it has these implications. One is bound to submit to the view of Members of another place who looked at this from their point of view. One is bound to acknowledge that the Government have given it some scrutiny, and I believe the Bill has been amended a number of times to meet objections and suggestions that have been made from the Government side. I merely conclude by saying that I do not think in this particular respect this Bill is the right way of doing it. I think to some extent it represents the natural instincts of Members of another place to get their fingers on anything in the range of state enterprise, institutionalised or otherwise, but whether it produces either satisfactory results for the enterprise or reassurance to the public, I very much doubt. That is my view for what it is worth, and my experience at least qualifies me to add my opinion to those of others, including my noble friend, who looks at it more from a professional accountancy point of view than I do.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0442P0I0353"/>
<col>691</col>
Bill and certainly a well-intentioned Bill; but I am aware that in the few hours that we have known about it, this Bill has aroused considerable anxiety. The anxieties are in no way political, but the Bill does affect the status of your Lordships' House. It falls to me to move the Second Reading because the Bill must come before this House, and convention requires that a Private Member's Bill which has passed through its stages in the other House should be moved by a Back-Bench friend in this House. I am the chosen instrument. I will not say that I drew the short straw, but the short straw was pushed out to me because I am a member of the Select Committee on Broadcasting, over which the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, presides.<lb/>
The Bill originated as a Ten Minute Rule Bill and was moved by the honourable Member for Goole, who did not even take 10 minutes. He took only six minutes just before the Budget Statement was introduced on 15th March, and I think we would all agree that this is a moment not likely to secure the Bill the greatest amount of notice.<lb/>
The purpose of the Bill is simple. It proposes to set up a Joint Committee of both Houses to make an annual report on the broadcasting of Parliament. My honourable friend believed that the provision of this machinery would keep the broadcasters on their toes and remind them that Parliament has sovereign power over the reporting of its own proceedings. It must be pointed out that the existing broadcasting committees of both Houses have the right and the power to meet together whenever they so wish, but it is unusual, and probably unprecedented, for a Joint Committee to be set up by legislation. It is also unprecedented to set up a Joint Committee with a majority from one House; we in this House would have an inferiority of one on the proposed committee.<lb/>
The Bill does not take away any of the powers of the House over broadcasting of its proceedings. As I said, it is well-intentioned. But I must admit that it has hardly been discussed in the other place, and there is no real opportunity for discussing it here beyond this debate tonight.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03210">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ardwick.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03211"><member>The Earl of Shannon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House is very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ardwick, for his description of the Bill in moving that it be read a second time. He did so with a certain amount of diffidence and raised many of the points which I feel I should bring to your Lordships' attention as to why your Lordships should not grant this Bill your approbation. I oppose it, firstly, because it is inappropriate; secondly, because it is unnecessary; and, thirdly, because it is undesirable. In moving that the Bill be read a second time the noble Lord referred to the fact that it had had very small consideration in the other place. I agree, because in searching through the <i>Official Report</i> of the other place I could find practically no reference to the Bill at all beyond about one column inch. Even bearing in mind the present haste in our parliamentary procedure, I must with great respect suggest that the Bill has not had the detailed thought that such a Bill should have.<lb/>
We must do justice to the Bill, which is clearly intended to be part of our statute law. In this respect
<col>692</col>
we must pause to consider what we are doing and the responsibilities which lie upon us. To put it bluntly, should we include in our primary legislation an enactment regarding the appointment and the reporting procedures of a Joint Committee concerned solely with the internal administrative arrangements between the two Houses of Parliament? This is the sort of arrangement which is usually dealt with, and which has been dealt with, by simple Motions in the respective Houses, and not by statute law. As has already been mentioned, your Lordships in fact already have a committee for the purposes proposed in the Bill.<lb/>
No, my Lords; surely we cannot possibly allow this. Quite apart from the detailed provisions in the Bill, which have also been referred to already, it will forever record in the laws of the land that your Lordships agree in a matter of exactly equal interest between both Houses that your Lordships accept an inferior position on the committee. I am sure that your Lordships will join with me in regretting, but with great respect and even allowing for the end-of-term feeling currently prevailing, that such a Bill is in principle and in detail totally unsuited and unnecessary to be included as an Act of Parliament and part of the statute law of this realm.<lb/>
To sum up, in my opinion the Bill is, first, inappropriate in that it is not a suitable subject for major legislation; secondly, it is unnecessary in that any objects which it wishes to achieve can easily be obtained by simple Motions in each House, as has been done in the past; and, thirdly, it is undesirable in that the suggested committee is not equitably constituted. With great respect, I suggest to your Lordships that a Second Reading is not granted to this Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03212"><member>Lord Spens</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I should speak on this because, in fact, I have tabled a manuscript amendment to be dealt with in Committee if this Bill receives its Second Reading. I also had to search through the <i>Official Report</i> of the other place to find out what had been said about this Bill there. As the noble Earl, Lord Shannon, has said, in fact only six minutes of a Ten-Minute Rule debate referred to the Bill at all, and in that no reference was made to the sort of machinery that could be included in the Bill. The reference was that "statutory machinery" would be used, but there was no reference to what that statutory machinery would be. That was on 15th March, just before the Budget.<lb/>
On 15th April there was a formal Second Reading with nothing said by anyone; and on 11th May&#x2014;that is, yesterday&#x2014;the remaining stages were passed, with nothing said by anyone. So the Bill has come to this House undebated in another place and contains what I personally consider to be an insult in the form of the attempt to make your Lordships the junior members, as it were, of this statutory Joint Committee, with only four Members from your Lordships' House as against five Members from another place.<lb/>
Therefore, the manuscript amendment which I have tabled for consideration, if by any chance your Lordships give this Bill a Second Reading, would create the parity which we ought to enjoy. In other words, I have suggested that there should be five
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0354"/>

Members from your Lordships' House to equal the five Members from another place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03213"><member>Lord Ferrier</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on my track record your Lordships would expect me to welcome this Bill with open arms, as being some measure of restraint upon the BBC's powers in relation to reporting the proceedings of Parliament. But the other day on "Any Questions" the question was asked: Why is there not some restraint by Parliament on the BBC? It is clear from what other noble Lords have said in the debate so far that there are obvious technical problems in this Bill which cannot be overcome. Although there has been very little time, I have glanced hack at some of the debates which have taken place on this matter, and I have transcribed one sentence of a speech by the late Lord Egremont in which he said:
<quote>"We ought to do more ourselves to communicate more directly with all the people of the country who we seek in our endeavours here to serve".</quote>
That goes for me, but what have we here? In the last few months we have seen a heavy curtailment of the time given to the broadcasting of the proceedings of Parliament, and also a reduction in the number of people who listen to the broadcasts. Another sentence that I have lifted from a previous debate also applies:
<quote>"The newsworthiness and the importance of a debate are not necessarily the same thing".</quote>
I believe that that has a bearing upon the considerations that we give to what the BBC has done to our system in the last few months, and I look forward to hearing further views. Perhaps we may hear from the Government Front Bench. Accordingly, I await the end of the debate before deciding whether or not to support the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

Having myself had some experience, I know of the great difficulties that there are in doing such a thing. Usually any old Bill which my noble friend wished to introduce would do&#x2014;except this one. We are in the unusual position of having from another place Bills which do not bear the inscription of the place from which they come. What the Bills tell us is who is moving them. Sometimes it is more important to know more about who is moving a Bill, than what they are moving. When I look at who were the sponsors of the Bill in another place. I see that among them are some individuals who would abolish your Lordships altogether if they get the chance, and three of them at least, I shall predict, will not be in the next Parliament. We cannot really accept this kind of legacy from such a nondescript source. I sincerely hope that we shall say that with the greatest regret the Bill cannot proceed at this hour, in this way, since in another place it has not gone through with the benefit of really serious discussion.<lb/>
I agree entirely with the noble Lord who complained that your Lordships cannot submit to an inferior position on a joint committee with another place. We are&#x2014;well, I need not pursue that point; it is so obvious. Whatever possessed them to think of putting such a
<col>694</col>
proposal in the Bill I do not know. Looking at the names, I wonder who did it. I would hesitate to draw attention to some of the individuals who are sponsors of the Bill.<lb/>
No, we do not need this, my Lords. As was pointed out a moment or two ago, we have our own committee. From this Chamber we have a different appeal to make to the listening public when compared with the other Chamber. We are more courteous. The standard of our debates is so much higher. We are so much more civilised. People think, "If we could only be run by the House of Lords, how much better the country would be"&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03217"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member><membercontribution>: When people listen to the noise from another place, they wonder what sort of rabble there is down there. Why then should we join with them in some joint enterprise to consider how we should best present ourselves to the public, or communicate with them? My Lords, we have our own technique. We have our own style. We have our own appeal; and we are in an entirely different position from the other place. As I said to noble friends around me, we are about to be sent on an enforced holiday, with no praise, no pay, and no prospects. This is a dismal condition in which to say goodbye to this Parliament.<lb/>
I could go on, my Lords, but the hour is late. I hope that your Lordships will not think that I have been hanging about all day in order to pour a lot of cold water over the last remnants of the dying Parliament on things which have drifted, blown down, the corridor from elsewhere. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Ardwick will undestand the muted reception that I am giving to his Bill. I feel that our parting shot to the dying Parliament and the legacy from another place should be, "Sorry chaps, it can't be done in this sort of way".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03218"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not know how one follows that. I know that we are anxious to hear the views of the Government Front Bench, but I think that a word or two should be heard from these Benches in support of what has been stated from the Cross-Benches. There has been one exception to the almost invariable practice of having on Joint Select Committees equal numbers from both Houses. That was the Joint Committee of some years ago on House of Lords reform where it was desired to have a Law Lord as chairman. That gave your Lordships a majority of one on the Committee. No such consideration arises here. We should surely observe the general rule of equal numbers.<lb/>
I turn from the four members to the four months mentioned in the Bill. Clause 1 states that the Committee shall report not later than four months after its appointment. Where you get legislation, you get rigiditv We might be up against a situation where something needed to be considered by the Committee that was complicated, difficult and also urgent. Parliament might wish that fewer than four months should be spent and that the Committee should report, say, in three months. However, the Committee might say, "No. This is complicated. We need our four months
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0355"/>
<col>695</col>
and an Act of Parliament has given us four months". Legislation would be required for Parliament to be able to impose its will and reduce the period to three months. That would seem to me a very good reason for not trying to do this by Act of Parliament, but in the ordinary way of passing Messages between the two Houses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03219"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is normal for someone who speaks from this Dispatch Box on a Private Member's Bill to give guidance to the House on whether the Bill should be accepted. I am afraid however that I must disappoint your Lordships. Traditionally, the broadcasting of Parliament is a matter that the Government leave to the two Houses. It is therefore not for me from this Bench to advise your Lordships either to accept or to reject this Bill. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, was rather against Joint Committees of any kind between the two Houses. Here, I must disagree with him. At the moment, we have two Joint Committees, one dealing with Consolidation Bills and the other with Statutory Instruments. These are set up under the Standing Orders of the two Houses.<lb/>
A similar Committee to that envisaged in this Bill could or course be set up in this way. The Bill is therefore not necessary, as some of your Lordships have pointed out. It is also possibly a rather inflexible way of proceeding. As the noble Lord, Lord Airedale, has stated from the Liberal Benches, any change required to be made in a Bill set up by an Act of Parliament would require another Act of Parliament to do so. Having said that, it is up to the House to decide.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03220"><member>Lord Brougham and Vaux</member><membercontribution>: Before my noble friend sits down, I should like as a humble Back Bencher to take up a few moments of your Lordships' time to thank my noble friend the Chief Whip not only for his eloquent speech but also for the fact that it could be a maiden speech apart from his remark of dinners being available. I should like to thank him on behalf of all noble Lords for guiding us through this term of Parliament and to wish him well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03221"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think, in order to put my noble friend in order, in making those few remarks before I sat down, I should like to thank him very much for the kindness that he has shown.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03222"><member>Lord Ardwick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, just as the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, regretted that he could not give me warmer support for the Bill, I regret that I cannot give a more enthusiastic backing to it on behalf of my honourable friend the Member for Goole. I should like to acquit him of any charge of wanting to insult the House. He simply got it wrong. He must have been thinking of the differential proportion of members for the Council of Europe. That difference is totally unacceptable on a joint committee.<lb/>
I still think that the idea contains a certain amount of virtue and that it should be considered by the two committees. They should consider in the new Parliament whether it might be useful to get together and issue a joint report, but there is no need for a Bill for that purpose. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>

<col>697</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03236"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member>: In 1972 the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch drew up a nuclear attack pattern as an example for use in training and in the development of exercise. It was based on 179 bombs with a total yield of 193 megatons. It does not take into account changes in strategic assumptions nor the deployment by the Soviet Union of the non-strategic, more accurate SS.20 missile. It has not been used for some years and we have no plans to publish it. Current civil defence planning is based on a range of possible attacks from conventional bombing to a nuclear attack on civil and military targets.</p>

However, arrangements have been made for local authorities to inform courts of the length of time of any remand in care, and the circumstances of the placement, including any placement in secure accommodation, so that the courts can take this into account.</p>

<title>LIVING ANIMALS AND SCIENTIFIC<lb/> EXPERIMENTS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03250"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03251">What are their proposals for new legislation on scientific procedures on living animals; and whether they will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03252"><member>Lord Elton</member>: In a White Paper published today my right honourable friend the Home Secretary proposes new legislation to control scientific experiments on living animals. This legislation, which will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time permits, will repeal the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act and bring in completely new controls. We believe that the measures proposed will greatly strengthen protection for animals without unduly prejudicing the undoubted benefits to humanity of the necessary minimum of animal procedures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03253">The main changes proposed will be as follows. Controls are to be imposed on a wider range of procedures involving animals in laboratories. For the first time suppliers of animals for use in laboratories will have to be registered. Animals commonly used for experimentation will have to be obtained from these registered suppliers. All aspects of the regulation of accommodation and care of animals in laboratories will be put on a statutory basis.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03254">A new system of licensing for all projects is proposed to ensure that suffering is kept to an irreducible minimum, and that reliable alternative methods not involving animals are used whenever practicable. Particularly stringent controls will apply to all applications for project licences to test cosmetics on animals.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03255">A new statutory committee, the Animals Procedures Committee, is to be established, and will have wide powers to advise on any matters which the Home Secretary refers to it as giving rise to special concern. For example, all applications to test cosmetics on animals will be referred to this committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03256">The Home Office Inspectorate will be strengthened and will have new and enhanced duties in operating the <i>new controls.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03257">The White Paper is based on a wide range of representations we have received, especially on the recommendations of my right honourable friend's Advisory Committee on Animal Experiments, and on the draft Council of Europe Convention for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. My right honourable friend is proposing stricter controls than the minimum the convention would permit, particularly in refusing to allow any exception to the prohibition on the infliction upon animals of pain which is both severe and enduring.</p>

<title>GEOFFREY ARTHUR PRIME:<lb/> SECURITY COMMISSION REPORT</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03258"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03259">Whether they have received the report of the Security Commission on the case of Geoffrey
<col>700</col>
Arthur Prime, and whether they will make a statement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03260"><member>The Lord Privy Seal (Baroness Young)</member>: In my right honourable friend the Prime Minister's Statement on 11th November 1982 she announced that, after consultation with the right honourable gentleman the Leader of the Opposition, she had asked the Security Commission to investigate the circumstances in which breaches of security had, or might have, occurred arising out of the case of Geoffrey Arthur Prime, who was convicted on 10th November 1982 of offences under the Official Secrets Act 1911, and to advise in the light of that investigation whether any change in security arrangements was necessary or desirable.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03261">The commission have completed their task and submitted their report. The Government are most grateful to Lord Bridge of Harwich, Lord Justice Griffiths, Lord Allen of Abbeydale and General Sir Hugh Beach for their work. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister gave assurances in another place on 11 th November that the commission's findings would be laid before Parliament to the fullest extent compatible with national security. A Command Paper is being published this afternoon. It contains the full text of the commission's report, but not the appendices to the report which contain classified information which it would not be in the public interest to publish.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03262">Prime was employed in the public service from 1956 to 1977, first in the Royal Air Force and subsequently, from 1968 to 1977, in Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). The functions of GCHQ, which are carried out under the ministerial responsibility of my right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, are to ensure the security of the United Kingdom's military and official communications, and to provide signals intelligence in accordance with requirements laid upon it by the Government in support of the Government's defence and foreign policies. From 1968 to 1977, Prime worked on signals intelligence in GCHQ, and during that time and until November 1981 he passed a great deal of his knowledge of this most sensitive area to the Russians. There is no doubt that his disclosures caused exceptionally grave damage to the interests of this country and its allies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03263">The commission say that there is no positive evidence to contradict Prime's statement that he acted alone. There have been intensive and extensive investigations, but no evidence has so far come to light to suggest that Prime had an accomplice or that the Soviet Union has, or had, another source of information within GCHQ. Nevertheless, investigations are continuing with a view to being as certain as possible on this point.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03264">Prime was first given positive vetting clearance by the RAF in 1966. During the time that Prime was spying for the Russians, his positive vetting status was reviewed four times, in 1968, 1973, 1974 and 1976, but on no occasion was any doubt cast on his reliability. The commission examined closely all these vetting clearances. They concluded that the fact that Prime's espionage activities were not discovered was not attributable to any failure to operate the positive vetting procedures properly.</p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0358"/>
<col>701</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03265">In the course of the investigations that have taken place since Prime's trial, his first wife has disclosed that Prime confessed to her in 1973 that he was a spy. Her close friend, Miss Barsby, has admitted that the then Mrs. Prime reported this confession to her at that time. Neither woman came forward to denounce Prime. The then Mrs. Prime was not seen in the course of the subsequent PV investigations, but Miss Barsby was; indeed. Prime nominated her as one of his referees. Not only did she not volunteer her knowledge of Prime's confession, but she took the positive step of telling the investigator who interviewed her that she had no reason to think Prime should not be entrusted with secret Government work. Had she acted differently, Prime's spying could have been brought to an end in 1973.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03266">The commission say that they can attach no blame to the investigation officer who carried out the 1973 review. The officer concerned is no longer living, but he seems from the records to have put all the relevant questions to Miss Barsby, and there appears to have been no reason why he should have suspected that Miss Barsby was deliberately lying to him, or should not have accepted her assurances as to Prime's character and reliability.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03267">One other matter which, if it had emerged during the PV review, might have resulted in Prime's clearance being withdrawn, was the fact that he had consulted a psychiatrist in November 1972. The psychiatrist's report cast doubt on Prime's stability. Prime should have reported this visit under staff regulations but he did not do so, and GCHQ had no other means of finding out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03268">The commission also identified weaknesses in physical and document security at GCHQ. In particular they criticise the control of photocopying facilities at one period in the past and refer to infrequency of spot musters of particular documents. Tighter controls in this area would have been unlikely to lead to Prime being detected, but they might have restricted his activities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03269">The commission recognise that personnel security measures, no matter how rigorous, can never provide an absolute guarantee against disloyalty. They have nevertheless recommended a number of measures to improve our defences. The Government accept the commission's recommendations, and will implement them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03270">Some of these recommendations fall within the framework of the existing security system. These cover:
<ul>
<li>the wider use of random searches of staff leaving Government buildings where staff handle highly classified material in substantial quantities;</li>
<li>more emphasis on the responsibility of managers for security supervision; and</li>
<li>procedures for access, with the individual's consent, to medical records.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03271">These recommendations are of general application to all Government departments and staff with access to highly classified information. The commission recommend that more radical screening procedures should be applied to staff in intelligence and security
<col>702</col>
agencies with access to the most sensitive categories of information. These recommendations include:
<ul>
<li>more rigorous standards for PV in those agencies;</li>
<li>consideration of the introduction of psychological testing in security screening of applicants for employment in these agencies who would have access to information of the highest classification;</li>
<li>the extension of PV investigations in relation to such applicants to include interviews with independent witnesses other than the referees named by the person to be vetted; and</li>
<li>a pilot scheme to test the feasibility of polygraph security screening in the intelligence and security agencies.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03272">The commission conclude that the polygraph is the only measure of which it could be said with any confidence that it would have protected GCHQ from Prime's treachery, because it would either have deterred him from applying to join or could have exposed him in the course of examination. In view of this and of the extreme gravity of the damage caused by Prime, the Government accept the commission's recommendation that a full and thorough pilot scheme should be carried out. The commission recognise that a polygraph examination is generally regarded as a disagreeable experience and would be seen by some as an unwarranted invasion of their privacy. But we are dealing with matters of the highest national security, and those who have access to the nation's most sensitive secrets must expect to be subject to the most rigorous vetting procedures. Moreover, the commission propose that questioning under the polygraph should be limited to counterintelligence examination&#x2014;such as exposure to approaches by hostile intelligence services&#x2014;and should not extend to questions of life-style, such as criminality, drug taking, sexual matters and financial affairs. They also recommend that in no case should a supposedly adverse polygraph indication be treated by itself as a ground to withhold clearance without independent confirmation from some other source. The Government are in full agreement with the commission that safeguards of this nature must be incorporated in the pilot scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03273">All security procedures imply some degree of encroachment upon the rights and freedom of the individual. We have to decide how to strike the balance between those considerations and the need to protect national security, in laying down security procedures that will be as effective as possible within the limits of what is acceptable in a free and democratic society. In doing so we have to bear in mind that no system of security can be guaranteed to confer absolute protection. I believe that the commission's recommendations are reasonable, and I commend them to the House as necessary to strengthen the security arrangements which exist to protect our free and democratic society.</p>

<image src="S5LV0442P0I0359"/>
<col>703</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03276"><member>Baroness Young</member>: The reports of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body and the Top Salaries Review Body on certain top salary groups and on parliamentary pay and allowances have been laid before the House today and will be published as Command Papers shortly. Copies are now available in the Printed Paper Office. The Government are grateful to the members of the review bodies for these reports and for the time and care which they have put into their preparation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03277">The report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body recommends new rates of pay for Servicemen and women applicable from 1st April 1983 which will add 7&#x00B7; 2 per cent. to the estimated pay bill for 1983&#x2013;84. The Government accept the report, and the necessary steps to implement the new rates of pay, and inform servicemen of the details of the report, will be taken as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03278">The report of the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body recommends with effect from 1st April 1983 increases in the pay of doctors and dentists which the review body estimate would add 6 per cent. to the pay bill over and above the costs of implementing in full their recommendations for 1st April 1982; in addition they recommend changes in certain supplementary payments to take account of the hours worked by junior hospital doctors and dentists, which will add a further I per cent. to the total pay bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03279">The House will recall that since 1981 there has been an abatement of the review body's recommendations for doctors and dentists which now amounts to 2&#x00B7;7 per cent. of the pay bill. The review body have strongly urged that this abatement should now be made good. The Government accept the recommended increases for this year with effect from 1st April 1983. They propose to make good the abatement with effect from 1st January 1984. The scales and rates resulting from these decisions will be promulgated as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03280">The two reports from the Top Salaries Review Body, one dealing with the salaries of the higher Civil Service, senior officers in the armed forces and the judiciary, and the other dealing with the salaries of Members of Parliament and of Ministers and other office holders and parliamentary allowances, will be for consideration after the election.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03281">So far as the proposed salaries for Cabinet Ministers are concerned, members of the Cabinet take the view that the increases proposed are of a magnitude which they could not possibly accept, and trust that Members of Parliament will take a similar view about recommendations affecting their own salaries. The Government believe that any decisions which are reached in the new Parliament about resettlement arrangements should apply also to Members of the present Parliament in relation to their present salaries. The Government acknowledge the need to consult opinion widely before the House reaches a conclusion on the recommendations.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03284"><member>Baroness Young</member>: It is for individual Ministers to decide whether and how to make the findings of Rayner Scrutinies public and it is the Government's policy to make as much information on which policy decisions are taken available as possible&#x2014;including scrutinies. Publication of the full details may not always be appropriate; for example, where there is commercially sensitive information or where the scrutiny deals with arrangements to prevent fraud. In a number of cases scrutinies have remained unpublished eight months or more after the report has been presented to the Minister concerned.</p>

This will generate real, permanent jobs.</p>

<title>BRITISH INDUSTRY: COST EFFECTIVENESS</title>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03296">With reference to the oral answer by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Securtiy, on 28th April 1983 (H.L. Deb. column 1047) indicating an improvement of cost competitiveness of British Industry of 15 per cent. in the third quarter of 1982:
<ol>
<li>(a) what is the definition of British Industry: in particular, does it include both the public and the private sector and to what extent in each case;</li>
<li>(b) what country or countries were used for the purpose of comparison;</li>
<li>(c) what formula is used for the purpose of measuring the change in competitiveness;</li>
<li>(d) for the purpose of the oral answer, what figures or amounts were used in applying the formula referred to in (c) above;</li>
<li>(e) what are the sources&#x2014;</li>
<ol>
<li>(i) in Britain</li>
<li>(ii) in the countries used for comparison for each of the figures or amounts referred to in (d) above.</li>
</ol>
</ol></p>
<col>706</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03297"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member>: The figures for cost competitiveness refer to munufacturing industry and include the public and private sector firms engaged in manufacturing. Comparison is made of the United Kingdom and weighted observations for the following countries: the U.S.A., Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada and Japan. The change in cost competitiveness is measured by the movement of the ratio of actual unit labour costs in manufacturing in the United Kingdom to a weighted average of unit labour costs in manufacturing in the 13 competitor countries&#x2014;all expressed in a common currency. The figures for United Kingdom cost competitiveness (United Kingdom relative unit labour costs) are calculated by the IMF and together with data on unit labour costs for the United Kingdom and some competitor countries can be found on page 46 of <i>Economic Trends.</i> The underlying data originate from national statistical sources.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03306">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03307">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether any guidelines have been issued to judges to ensure that they protect the freedom of the individual to bring to the notice of the media matters of public importance dealt with in open court.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03308"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, guidelines are not issued to the judiciary by members of the Executive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03309"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord consider the specific case to which I have drawn the attention of his office which was the case of a Mr. Zavorka in the Bloomsbury and Marylebone County Court on 11th March? The question which I want to put to the noble and learned Lord is that in this
<col>708</col>
case&#x2014;there is no criticism of the judge or the justices in this question&#x2014;the judge approved a settlement which prevented the defendant from speaking to the media after the case. This matter has been raised with me by the BBC which raised the issue and tried to interview the defendant. Will the noble and learned Lord give the House his wisdom on the principle of judges allowing such a settlement to prevent a defendant from making contact and giving information or an interview to any part of the media?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03310"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in this country people are free to settle their cases on terms that they choose and should keep their bargains after they have made them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03311"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble and learned friend aware that many will be disturbed that a Question such as this appears on your Lordships' Order Paper? To imply, however obliquely, that the judges need guidelines from politically orientated Governments is disturbing when one considers the importance of the impartiality of the judges in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03312"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that my original reply will dispose of the anxieties which my noble friend might feel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03313"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely there is no objection to putting down such a Question particularly when it receives such a robust Answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03314"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am the servant of the House in such matters. If the Question appears on the Order Paper I assume that it is in order; and, if it is in order, I answer it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03315"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord accept that there is absolutely no political motive in this Question? It is purely a matter of public interest. Will he address himself to the 1688 Bill of Rights? Does that not imply a freedom of speech which would at least suggest, in a case of this kind where a settlement has been reached which infringes the right of free speech, that in those circumstances judges might well intervene to disallow that part of the settlement which prevents either party from being in contact with the media after the case has finished?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03316"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: The Bill of Rights, my Lords, certainly protects the right of free speech; but the right of an individual to forgo communication by agreement with his opponent of that right in relation to the media is one that also has to be protected and defended when he has made the bargain.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Seveso Explosion: Poisonous Waste</title>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03331">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03332">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will give an unequivocal refusal to the request of the Italian Government for permission to receive into Great Britain 21 drums or bidons of soil from the explosion of Seveso in 1976 which is believed to contain the most deadly poison known to man for which the authorities have been seeking acceptance throughout Europe, and which is now detained at St. Quentin in France.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03333"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is a serious matter. No request to receive this waste has been made to the United Kingdom Government by the Italian Government or anyone else. In principle, it would be an unwelcome import.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03334"><member>Lord Hale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that I am grateful for that Answer and that I am very reassured by it, because what this Government might do in any given circumstances is unpredictable? I took this information straight from <i>The Times</i> newspaper, and I think I have referred him to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03335"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Question&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03336"><member>Lord Hale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, indeed I have a dozen extracts from <i>The Times</i> which show that 41 bidons (not 21) have been making the "Grand Tour" of Europe, carting about the most deadly poison in the world from a spot where it has been dug over for 20 years and at the very moment when a trial to investigate the origin of the poison and the question of care or otherwise in the exothermic explosion was actually starting in the absence of the defendants at Monza&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03337"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Question&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03338"><member>Lord Hale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree. May I add this? Would the noble Lord bear in mind that this is, as he says, a very serious matter, and that it would be to repudiate many pledges if there was any question of allowing this stuff to come into this country, and that&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03339"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I wonder whether the noble Lord would be good enough to put his supplementary question as succinctly as possible. I think that would be for the convenience of the House, and my noble friend would then be able to reply to it.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0363"/>
<col>711</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03340"><member>Lord Hale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am only too delighted to do so. Would the noble Lord bear in mind that the British citizen has had to put up with a great deal over the past four years? This really is something that he could not stand, and, indeed, is also clearly, literally, something that he could not swallow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03341"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are fully aware of the concern evidenced by the noble Lord in his taking up the substance of an article (which, I must say, at this stage appears to be a little speculative) in <i>The Times</i> newspaper. As I have already said, this is a very serious matter. There is no evidence that the waste has been brought into the United Kingdom, and we are taking every practical step to ensure that it does not enter the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03342"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could the Minister tell us why the Government did not place an immediate ban on the importation of these barrels&#x2014;a power which they have under the Control of Pollution Act 1974? Secondly, since representatives of county councils and port authorities recently told a Select Committee of your Lordships' House that they are not satisfied with the Government's promises to close the loopholes, could the Minister reassure the House that the present regulations governing the importation of dangerous chemicals are adequate?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03343"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I am sure the noble Baroness will know, in this respect the Control of Pollution Act operates under a system of licences, and the Government are convinced that this system of licences is adequate. Powers to ban or restrict imports exist, but whether they would apply would depend upon the actual material, its condition, packaging and what was proposed to be done with it; and, indeed, whether a licence was in force which would cover the particular chemical and the proposed action with regard to it.<lb/>
But we do not know for sure what the waste is, or in what condition, and I really cannot say whether that would apply. Simple dislike of the material is not a reason in law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03344"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, bearing in mind that this consignment of poison is reported to have left Italy in a lorry with a Right-wing Italian senator sitting beside the driver, will the Government take special care to investigate the cabs of all lorries arriving at our ports to see which Right-wing legislators are sitting beside the drivers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03345"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, any containers which could possibly contain this waste will be examined at all ports of entry into this country, whoever may accompany them or drive them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03346"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend the Minister whether within the Community context there are any arrangements for the disposal of this sort of material, and what is to be done with it eventually?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03347"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is exactly the problem. Nobody knows what is to be done with it eventually because the transport of hazardous waste
<col>712</col>
throughout the Community is accompanied by licences to enable it to be transported from one country to a different country. The Select Committee on Science and Technology of your Lordships' House have recently reported on their investigation into hazardous waste disposal, and they comment on the proposed draft directive to deal with just that problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03348"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as we are talking about some deadly poison, should there not be some international convention or control, even wider than the Community, to prevent this sort of hazard being carted around the world in the hope that some unfortunate people will be foolish enough to accept it?</membercontribution></p>

An international treaty covering the disposal or transport of such waste does not exist, so far as I am aware; but I certainly agree that this is likely to become a worldwide problem and should be dealt with on a worldwide scale.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Housing: Empty Properties</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03352">11.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03353"><member>The Earl of Kinnoull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03354">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03355">To ask Her Majesty's Government what progress they are making towards reducing the number of empty residential properties in the public sector.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03356"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government are greatly concerned at the 19,000 residential properties which were reported on 1st April 1982 as having been empty for more than one year. Among many Government initiatives, the most recent is to ask councils in their housing investment programme returns for 1984&#x2013;85 to indicate their specific intentions for bringing back into use dwellings empty for more than one year and the proposed expenditure, if any, involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03357"><member>The Earl of Kinnoull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his informative reply. Does he agree that the unacceptably large number of empty houses in the public sector is really a shameful reflection of the failure of certain local authority housing policies? Can
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0364"/>
<col>713</col>
he identify today some of the worst cases and also say what success Her Majesty's Government have had during the lifetime of this Parliament in persuading local authorities to reduce the number of empty houses?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03358"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the HIP returns to which I referred, the regular quarterly up-date is to be found in your Lordships' Library. I regret to say that included among the figures is a list of what I can only describe as "the good, the bad and the ugly" in this respect.<lb/>
The important figure is the long-term vacant, as a percentage of the totally vacant, housing stock, which ranges in the worst 34 cases from 8&#x00B7;44 per cent. in Leeds to an enormous 80&#x00B7;83 per cent. in the district of Sedgefield in County Durham. The Government's policies are well known, but I am glad to have this opportunity to reiterate the measures taken in the last four years, which include the improvement-for-sale scheme, permits issued to those authorities wishing to waive for a period the interest on mortgages granted for homesteading, powers for local authorities to guarantee building society mortgages and many, many other things. I hope that will give a guide to the great work that this Government have done during their period of office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03359"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord agree that this is a vital Question which has been raised by the noble Earl, for one particular reason? Acknowledging that the local authorities have done a magnificent job in providing homes for millions of British families&#x2014;that is why this is such a poignant subject when there are residences in both the public and private sectors which are left to rot for whatever reason&#x2014;will the Minister be prepared to consider that this must be an offence against the planning regulations of those very authorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03360"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; I am very grateful to the noble Lord. I seem to remember describing this particular problem last week as "a scandal". Certainly, I would stick by that, and so I am sure would the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03361"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the Minister what figures he was working from? The latest figures I have been able to find relate to the situation in 1979, and one cannot get any later figures from his department. I agree with everybody that any waste of housing, under whatever Government, is a very bad thing with the housing waiting lists as they are. Is it true that these figures are due to over-eager purchase in the late 1970s? Does he agree that the 50 per cent. reduction in the housing investment programme between 1979 and 1982&#x2014;including a moratorium&#x2014;has had an effect, as has also the operation of the project control system, whereby many of the local authorities which have asked to carry out this work to make houses habitable have been rejected by the DoE?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03362"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I do not think that is true at all. The noble Baroness says "Yes, it is". We shall get to that in a moment. The figures to which I am referring, and which I said were in your
<col>714</col>
Lordships' Library were the housing investment programme returns dated April 1982. They are the most recent figures that I have, and I quoted just now from that list.<lb/>
My honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Construction has recently commissioned a study by the department's housing services advisory unit, and copies of its report, <i>Reducing the Number of Empty Dwellings,</i> have been sent to the local authorities. The Government accept that in certain cases local authorities face inherent difficulties in dealing with these properties. But nearly 300 authorities managed to keep their void level to 2 per cent. or below&#x2014;incidentally, 2 per cent. is the national average&#x2014;and the 60 or so authorities' with higher void levels should naturally aim to match this performance. Surely if 300 can do it the rest can do it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03363"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister able to tell us whether he believes that some of these long-term vacancies are in areas where there is a very small waiting list and where there is really an over-supply of accommodation? This is a complex problem and I ask the Minister to consider the point that in some areas there is a great shortage of council accommodation while in others there is already an over-supply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03364"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the time available I am afraid that I have not been able to correlate the two sets of figures. However, if there is a very short waiting list&#x2014;in other words, virtually instantaneous housing, which my noble friend will know far better than I whether or not is a comparatively rare occurrence&#x2014;it would presuppose that the councils have no need for the buildings and therefore are perfectly entitled to sell them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03365"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend whether the Government will make every effort to ensure that a certain residential property in the public sector not far from here does not become vacant&#x2014;even briefly&#x2014;in four weeks' time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03366"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can think of whole streets not very far from here&#x2014;one, in particular&#x2014;which I am absolutely determined shall not become vacant in the near future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03367"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask how the Government would reconcile that reply with their stated policy of encouraging social and housing mobility, with an eye to the industrial regeneration of this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03368"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry my Lords. There was rather more laughter than I expected at that question. Therefore, I did not get the full purport of it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03369"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord referred to a document which he described as "HIP". Can he explain the meaning of those letters? Have they anything to do with urging us to shout "Hip, hip hooray&#x0021;" at the end of the Government today?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03370"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Alas not, my Lords. It is a very serious table and it refers to the housing investment programme.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Northern Ireland Act 1974 (Interim Period<lb/> Extension) Order 1983</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03371">11.31 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03372"><member>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (The Earl of Cowrie)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft Northern Ireland Act 1974 (Interim Period Extension) Order 1983, which was laid before this House on 10th May, be approved. It may be for the convenience of your Lordships if we take this order together with the draft Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (Continuance) Order 1983, which was also laid before the House on 10th May. I take it that there is no objection to the suggestion that we whould take the two orders together.<lb/>
The effect of this order is to extend the period of direct rule by 12 months until July 1984. Under the Northern Ireland Act 1974, the interim period of direct rule cannot last for more than a year without being extended by order. That Act not only provided that the Northern Ireland Assembly elected in the previous year should be dissolved; it also provided that, during direct rule, legislation for Northern Ireland which would have been passed by the Assembly could instead be passed at Westminster by Order in Council, and that the executive responsibilities of the Northern Ireland administration should be exercised by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.<lb/>
It is necessary to extend these direct rule provisions even though, following the passing of the Northern Ireland Act 1982, an Assembly has once again been elected in Northern Ireland. That Assembly has entered with energy on the task of scrutinising the activities of the Northern Ireland departments, but, as the House will be aware, responsibility for all aspects of Northern Ireland affairs remains with Parliament, and with Ministers of the United Kingdom Government who are answerable to Parliament, pending any devolution of powers. It is therefore necessary to renew the provisions for this direct rule.<lb/>
The Government recognise both the strengths and the weaknesses of direct rule. Although I do not believe that direct rule aggravates the differences in Northern Ireland society, and may indeed to some extent neutralise them, it does not offer the prospect of a settled and stable political framework for the long term. That is why the Assembly has been elected in a positive and constructive attempt to respond to the particular needs of the Province. We hope that in time the elected representatives of all constitutional parties will move towards agreement on devolution in the Assembly. Meanwhile, the machinery of direct rule must be maintained, and I accordingly commend this order to your Lordships.<lb/>
I now turn to the security situation and to the renewal of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act for a further six months' period. There are two questions: are these provisions needed, and, if they are, should they be renewed in the same form? I know that the House is well aware that violence in Northern Ireland, although greatly diminished over the past decade, still continues at a high level, and that the threat of further violence remains very real. So far in this year, 10 members of the security forces and 10
<col>716</col>
civilians have been killed by terrorists; the last of these incidents occurred just two days ago in Londonderry, when a wife who was trying to protect her husband was murdered while he (a soldier) and her sister were wounded. Only last Monday night, four bombs were planted in and around the centre of Belfast causing extensive damage but, mercifully, no further loss of life.<lb/>
Your Lordships will appreciate that the absence of further tragedies on the scale of last December's explosion at Ballykelly is not due to any lack of effort on the part of those violent men; in a small part, it could be attributed to good fortune. But I remain convinced that it is principally due to the care and vigilance of the security forces, and to the co-operation of the whole community in Northern Ireland with them. One can well imagine the devastation which the 500lb bomb which was intercepted by the security forces on 26th April on the Falls Road could have caused in a busy street or shopping centre. The Chief Constable and the General Officer Commanding strongly believe that, if it were not for their emergency powers to carry out operations based on the provisions of this Act, their ability to protect lives and property in Northern Ireland would be seriously eroded.<lb/>
The same arguments can be applied to the operation of the courts in Northern Ireland. Many of the special provisions in the Act relating to the trial of what are called "terrorist-type" offences are designed to overcome problems caused by intimidation of both witnesses and jurors&#x2014;a problem that has also had to be faced, as your Lordships will be aware, in the Republic of Ireland. Over the years, terrorists have demonstrated their ability to try to circumvent or subvert the judicial system. They have ruthlessly attacked the judiciary&#x2014;the murder of Judge Doyle being the latest example&#x2014;and have also attacked members of the public who have had the courage to act as witnesses against them. As we have seen from the pressures put upon these witnesses, which have included threats of violence against their families made in open court, these men of violence are deeply concerned about the damage which such evidence can cause to their own organisations. I am convinced that we must ensure that the courts have the powers to withstand these pressures and to arrive at the true facts. Without the special procedures introduced by this Act, the courts would encounter serious difficulties in ensuring that justice is done.<lb/>
I recognise that there are those who have reservations about certain of the provisions in this Act, notwithstanding the fact that they may in principle agree to the need for its continuance. I do not intend to take up time at this stage with detailed arguments for the renewal of each separate element of the Act. Your Lordships will be aware of the review which has now been set up to inquire into the Act, with a view particularly to ensuring that&#x2014;however difficult&#x2014;a proper balance is maintained between the liberties of the individual and the need to give the security forces and the courts adequate powers to protect the public from a unique and awful threat. The review is being undertaken by Sir George Baker, who has already started work. I have myself in this week had a meeting with Sir George. I am sure that it would not be right to make any changes to the legislation by allowing any
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0366"/>
<col>717</col>
particular sections to lapse until Sir George's work is completed. It is then, not now, that the Government and your Lordships will want to consider the nature of the provisions. For all these reasons, I believe that it would be imprudent and prejudicial to do anything other than extend their life for another six months, and I seek your Lordships' agreement to that. My Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03373">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 10th May be approved.&#x2014;(<i>The Earl of Gowrie.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03374">11.39 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03375"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I always find it useful to follow the noble Earl, because, in general, I find that his approach to these serious problems is one which is in line with the views of myself and my colleagues. I join him in his tribute to the effectiveness of our security forces. Naturally, we regret that continued violence and terrorism necessitates renewal of the emergency provisions order. Although it is generally accepted that the basic cause is men of and violence, nevertheless the serious economic and social conditions which we have debated on a number of occasions in your Lordships' House are also contributory causes. That is one reason, apart from others, why we supported the recently debated move towards industrial incentives.<lb/>
We on this side of the House have always regarded the six-monthly consideration of the renewal of the order as an opportunity also to discuss the operation of the emergency provisions. As the noble Earl has said, for some time there have been reservations, particularly by those on these Benches and by my colleagues in the other place, about certain aspects of the emergency provisions. I agree with the noble Earl that this is neither the time nor the place to go into the details. First, your Lordships discussed many of these points in the recent debate initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. Secondly, as the noble Earl has said, the review, which we have repeatedly urged, is now to take place. We shall await the report with considerable interest. I was pleased to note the stress laid by the noble Earl on the terms of reference: that the review must balance the interests of individual human rights and the liberty of individuals against the need for security. This, we noted, was the attitude adopted by the noble Earl, Lord Jellicoe, in his report on the Prevention of Terrorism Act. This we all welcomed. I am pleased to note that this attitude is to be adopted by the review to which the noble Earl has referred.<lb/>
Despite the general election, I hope that this will be the last occasion when there will be a need to renew the order and that the review will enable new legislation to be introduced. In the event of a change of Government, my colleagues and I would wish this review to be completed before the order again has to be renewed. I hope this will also be the attitude of the present Government if, unfortunately, they are returned to office.<lb/>
Over and above whatever steps have to be taken which are thought to be necessary in the interests of security, it is generally recognised that eventually there must be a political settlement. The last day of this Parliament is not the occasion to have a detailed debate on the future of the political situation in
<col>718</col>
Northern Ireland. However, as we are debating the renewal of the order which continues direct rule, some comments must be made about it. We recognise that the continuing circumstances necessitate the renewal of the order, but we do so with reluctance. We on these Benches have never believed that direct rule could or should be a permanent or satisfactory system of government for Northern Ireland. We on these Benches gave support to the Northern Ireland Bill. We hoped that the Assembly would be able to establish a local form of administration which would receive the broad support of both communities.<lb/>
Speaking for myself, I have been encouraged by the reports of discussions in the Assembly. I echo the plea of the noble Earl that even at this stage the constitutional parties and the other parties which have elected representatives at the Assembly will participate in those discussions. I am also pleased that the Secretary of State and the noble Earl have made it absolutely clear from time to time that they would not propose any steps towards devolution which did not command cross-community support. We cannot tolerate for many years the administration of Northern Ireland by Orders in Council. Although it may seem trivial to refer to it, our recent debate on the Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order showed clearly that matters which ought to be the subject of primary legislation should not be dealt with by Orders in Council. That order introduced, as was mentioned in the debate, primary legislation which should have been the subject of a Bill.<lb/>
We have considered the emergency provisions. These orders go together. We on these Benches have declared our desire for reconciliation between the two communities in Northern Ireland and, ultimately, reconciliation between North and South. However, we have no illusions. Reconciliation cannot be achieved overnight. We have also declared unreservedly that any constitutional change would require the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. I have no desire to engage in electioneering on a matter of this kind. However, noble Lords may ask about the policy of the party which sits on these Benches. In our campaign document, which undoubtedly will be part of our election manifesto, we make this clear declaration. We aim to establish an agreed devolved administration; in the meantime we shall continue with direct rule. We shall also initiate early discussions between the British Government, the Irish Government, the Irish Labour Party, the trade unions on both sides of the border and political representatives of the people of Northern Ireland on how best to proceed with our policy of unification by consent.<lb/>
It is in that spirit that we support renewal of the first order, which continues direct rule, and also the renewal of the emergency provisions order, for the reasons outlined by the noble Earl, which we support. In the meantime, it behoves everyone who believes in constitutionalism to be careful in their words and actions. Eventually there has to be a political settlement. Security measures are required now, but at the end of the day there must be political action to deal with this problem. If we cannot in our own civilised way deal with the problem of Northern Ireland, the outlook for the wider problems of the world remains dismal.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03376">11.48 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03377"><member>Lord Hampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not very well up on dissolutions, but instinct tells me that this is not the time for lengthy debate. I shall speak to both orders together, and briefly. My party supports the present Northern Ireland Assembly, favours its deliberations by elected members and looks forward to a return to power sharing in the Province. One hopes that this could then be followed by the rolling devolution of powers, in place of direct rule from Westminster.<lb/>
I was attracted by a misguided, while welcome, suggestion that a good answer to the Irish problem would be a united Ireland hack in the Commonwealth, but realism forces one to accept that that idea is not attractive to a majority of the people concerned. Both Labour and Conservative Governments have supported the guarantee that Northern Ireland should stay within the United Kingdom, so long as a majority of people clearly wish it. It would be immoral as well as unwise to go back on this guarantee.<lb/>
We would welcome participation by the nationalist SDLP in Assembly affairs. We admire the work of the non-sectarian Alliance Party of Northern Ireland which is seeking with effect to bridge the divide between the two communities. We believe that consultation must certainly also proceed with Dublin. We recognise that security will have to be maintained at a very high level and that greater cross-border co-operation needs to be further encouraged. The major responsibility for security lies with the RUC and the UDR, supplemented when necessary by British armed forces. The need to protect citizens from violence and intimidation remains. Emergency legislation needs to be kept under constant review, and we anticipate Sir George Baker's review with interest. The operation of temporary provisions requires constant vigilance.<lb/>
At the same time we are in no doubt that it is better to have one's liberty mildly interfered with than to suffer the ultimate in the loss of life or limb in a bomb outrage. In general, we believe that the situation in Ulster is very slowly improving and that great patience is necessary&#x2014;particularly when depression sets in over renewed acts of violence and terrorism. As always, we repeat our thanks to the security forces for their courage and efficiency. We offer our support also to the great number of good people in the Province who are working&#x2014;not without effect&#x2014;for a better day.<lb/>
I thank the noble Earl for introducing this order, but will ask him just one question. I understand that neither of these two orders needs to be renewed before the end of July. Why, then, are they being rushed through today? Since they have been passed in another place, however, it is clearly unthinkable in any case that we should oppose them now. We support them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03378"><member>Lord Kilbracken</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like briefly to express my support for what has been said by my noble friend on the Front Bench, and I will just take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, about the early renewal of these two orders, one of which does not expire until the very end of July. Mine is a completely non-controversial question, but I should like to know whether the period for which these orders are introduced&#x2014;12 months and six months respectively&#x2014;will run from today or from the day on which these orders would otherwise have expired?</membercontribution></p>
<col>720</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03379">11.52 a.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03380"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, It would take a much braver person than I to prolong the debate of this particular Parliamentary Session by more than a few minutes; but I believe we owe it to the people of Northern Ireland whose lives are fundamentally affected by the powers contained in these orders not to treat the passing of them as a mere formality.<lb/>
On the first order concerning direct rule, it seems entirely appropriate that we should use the opportunity of this debate to examine the machinery of direct rule and to ensure that it is working as well as it possibly can. It is an important moment at which to remind ourselves of the existence of all the other frameworks available for working towards a final political solution for Northern Ireland which exist.<lb/>
Frameworks exist to take the strain off all the vulnerabilities which prevail in the present system of direct rule. We are very grateful to the noble Earl the Minister for telling us how the new Northern Ireland Assembly is working. We all wish it well. It looks to be surviving, and discussion continues there. That is of great importance. We are also extremely grateful that such a thorough examination was made by the noble Earl, Lord Jellicoe, into the workings of the PTA, and we are pleased to hear that Sir George Baker has already started on a review of the EPA. We should like the Government to give constant support to the enormous amount of community work that is in progress in Northern Ireland&#x2014;without which no political policies could be of any avail. We must also ask the Government to remember that the economic conditions in Northern Ireland, as my noble friend on the Front Bench has said, will be almost impossible to improve without a political solution.<lb/>
From the point of view of the other frameworks, we hope the Government (if they are returned) will remember that there is, first, a very good relationship between Dublin and London. This sometimes suffers from the most terrible hiccups, and we have seen that happen very recently. It is all the more reason why the work of finding a solution for Northern Ireland should be based on mutual trust and good relations. Another framework is that presented by the EEC. Again, we should like the Government to remember that, in order to establish a framework that eases the tensions of direct rule, we should like them to think again about the report offered by the European Parliament on the political and economic crisis. If something were to come out of this, it would be advantageous to the people of Northern Ireland.<lb/>
With regard to the second order before us, the noble Earl himself was saying that we must concentrate on the balance between the need to maintain law and order and the need to preserve civil rights for the people in Northern Ireland. Getting that balance right is of critical importance when one is involved in a struggle with paramilitary organisations of such a horrific nature.<lb/>
I welcome the review. We on this side of the House have been asking since 1981 for this review and we eagerly look forward to its findings. As the noble Earl said, many of us are concerned about particular areas. We are concerned that the people of Northern Ireland cannot get justice from these courts. They are worried
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0368"/>
<col>721</col>
about the length of time that suspects are held by the police for interrogation. It is a well known fact that if someone is held for seven days, all kinds of problems and repercussions result; for example, a man may lose his job if he is so detained. This is of great concern to the people who live there and who may suffer under the particular powers in these orders.<lb/>
I should like also to ask the Minister just two further questions. First, will the Government remember that it is important that any preventive programme carried out either in the social services or among community workers should aim to reduce the incidence of crime and the potential for it among young people in the Province? While the rate of unemployment is particularly high in the Province, juvenile crime in Northern Ireland is very often brought on by boredom and frustration. Once a young person becomes involved in crime in Northern Ireland, the next step might be for him to enter one of the paramilitary organisations. Preventive work is of enormous importance in the area of security in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
Secondly, does the noble Earl the Minister not agree that in order to help all those responsible for religious communities in Northern Ireland to maintain security, the press and other media of this country would be encouraged to give a more balanced view of what is going on there? I am constantly made aware of the fact that people here have no idea of the sterling work that is being done among the communities of Northern Ireland to overcome their own problems. This is very much the fault of the media, which should give some encouragement and a more balanced view of what is happening, which would be highly supportive to all those people who are working for a better future. Having said that, I should like to support the passing of these orders.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03381"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether I may be permitted to add just one sentence? I was fortunate enough to win the first place in the ballot for 25th May in respect of a Motion favouring a united Ireland. The general election will no doubt bring many benefits to many people but unfortunately it has had the disadvantage of postponing that Motion. Indeed, I believe that I have to start all over again and there is no certainty that I shall be so successful. I should just like to assure everybody that I shall not only do all in my power to ballot again but also to exercise any influence that I may have to bring a Motion of that kind before this House as soon as possible. I am very glad that the attitude of our party as stated by our deputy leader, my noble friend Lord Underhill, is as he described it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03382">12 noon</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03383"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful for the general tone of the short debate on these orders, and the supportive line taken by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, and the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, from the Opposition Benches. I would like to thank both noble Lords for their conduct of Opposition throughout this Parliament while they have had that task. It is, I think, immensely important, far more important than many people recognise, that there should be some
<col>722</col>
continuity and balance of policy in respect of Northern Ireland between the major political parties here, simply because Northern Ireland politics, which we all know are very difficult and intractable, are fundamentally about Northern Ireland issues and not about issues which directly affect the parties within the rest of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
Of course, one of the reasons why we agree with the Benches opposite that direct rule is not satisfactory is not because it has not provided stability and equity of administration&#x2014;I believe it has, under successive Governments&#x2014;but because the different political system in Northern Ireland means that there is no input from the Northern Ireland electorate to those who govern them, and in the long term that must be a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs. It is for those reasons, rather than for any sinister constitutional ambitions or for any desire to tinker around with a sensitive and difficult area of politics, that we have determinedly and against great odds tried to assemble together some form of local political debate and movement, with the prospect at least of the possibility, however hard it may be to achieve, of that Assembly taking back some regional responsibility for matters which, as all noble Lords have said, are deeply the concern of the people who live there.<lb/>
Having thanked the noble Lords opposite&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, in particular&#x2014;for supportive conduct of Opposition, I do, I must say, slightly regret (and I say this in no electioneering spirit, as I am sure noble Lords will be aware; Northern Ireland is not fundamentally an election issue in Britain at this time) the line taken by the Labour Party about unification by consent, because in a way this somewhat obscures the issue and the difficulty. The position of the British Government, of successive British Governments, has been very clear, that if consent were forthcoming there would be no great pressure from the rest of the United Kingdom against Irish unity being achieved. But in a way it makes the position harder in Northern Ireland if any expectations are stirred, whether here or in Northern Ireland itself, that this consent will be very likely to be forthcoming. It seems to me that it will not be forthcoming foreseeably, certainly in nearly all our lifetimes, and that therefore we must slowly start thinking, both here and in the province, and indeed among my compatriots and those of the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, in the Republic of Ireland, about what I would prefer to term plural or pluralist solutions, because foreseeably in the island of Ireland there will for a very long time be a British orientated population and an Irish orientated population. Those are the facts of life and we must seek to live with them. I believe that a policy which instead of remaining relatively neutral comes out for unification by consent may make the solution even harder.<lb/>
That point aside, may I quickly come to some of the questions which have been put to me. I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, and the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, why these orders were being put through now rather than waiting until the normal time of July and the outcome of the British general election. It seems to me that there is an important issue of confidence here. One of the problems of Northern Ireland politics is that the calling and holding of British
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0369"/>
<col>723</col>
general elections, as I have suggested, takes place in a context which is not concerned with Northern Ireland affairs. Therefore, protagonists in Northern Ireland politics are able to use British general elections as a method of putting across rather different sets of attitudes and different appeals for one kind of policy or another. It seemed to us that it was, therefore, important to make it very clear that Parliament as a whole, and all the major parties in Parliament, were concerned to underpin stability with continued direct rule during this electoral period. It makes sense, therefore, to have these orders in good place in good time before the relevant expiry dates get too close. As to the specific point put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Kilbracken, after renewal and extension direct rule and emergency powers will run for 12 and 6 months respectively from July, not from the date of this debate.<lb/>
I very much agree with the tenor of the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs. Did time permit&#x2014;we have, I think, gone over this during economic debates&#x2014;I could tell the House about the special programmes for young people and the support systems we are seeking to provide. We have some advantages over the rest of the United Kingdom. We are smaller and more intimate in scale, and we have been able to get some of these programmes off the ground rather faster than has been the case here in Britain. I am glad to report that they are working quite well.<lb/>
As to the appeal the noble Baroness made&#x2014;I do not know whether this was made to me or through me&#x2014;for a more balanced presentation by the media, I am glad to be able to remind her and the House that the recent Northern Ireland marathon got admirable coverage on television and in the papers here. I think it did surprise and please many people, not only here but in all parts of Europe, to get television coverage showing people of all persuasions, including some members of the security forces, running through West Belfast in an amicable spirit and being cheered by large crowds of onlookers. This serves to remind us that normal life has been breaking out all over in Northern Ireland, and whatever the intractable nature of Northern Ireland politics and whatever the threats to security, which still regrettably mean that I have to come before your Lordship to renew the second order in particular, in fact the general tenor of life in the Province has immensely improved for the better.<lb/>
The last word I would say is that I am very sorry, because I was looking forward to the debate that has been referred to; but the noble Earl, Lord Longford, is not the first aristocrat to become a victim of the guillotine; I rather bleed for him in this respect, as I was looking forward to going over the issue with him. That is, I am afraid, the luck of the game. My commiserations, and I hope he will be fortunate in the next Parliament.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Prohibition of Female Circumcision Bill [H. L.]</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03388">12.9 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03389">Report received.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03390">Clause 1 [<i>Prohibition of female circumcision</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03391"><member>Lord Rea</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 1. line 7, after ("person") insert ("for non medical reasons").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03392">The noble Lord said: My Lords, if I may, I would like to speak also to Amendments Nos, 3 and 5 standing in my name because, as I will explain, they are linked. This amendment is really the same of that of the noble Lord, Lord Hunter, at Committee stage three days ago, but the wording is altered so that it will, I hope, be more acceptable. It clarifies which operations should be prohibited. In the Bill as it stands at present approximately 9,000 legitimate operations per annum could be classified as prohibited. I understood the problem involved in using the words,
<quote>"for ritual, cultural or traditional reasons",</quote>
in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunter of Newington, from the point of view of both interpretation by the court and also that it could be interpreted as revealing an attitude in this country which is intolerant of the customs of other cultures, although in this case everyone will agree that no one should tolerate this particular custom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03393">For these reasons I did not support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunter, although I fully agreed with and understood his purposes. I have the highest regard for the noble Lord, Lord Hunter, who always makes clear and extremely helpful contributions in this House. However, in this case I think he was too modest and did not spell out the purposes of his amendment as loudly and as clearly as he might have done.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03394">In his comments on the amendment the Minister intimated why he felt that the amendment was a good one and why he was in favour of it, but I do not think his words sank in so I shall quote some of them again. He said, referring to the noble Lord, Lord Kennet:
<quote>"the way he has constructed his Bill is to prohibit all operations on these parts of the female anatomy and then to provide certain savings in terms of medical necessity".&#x2014;[<i>official Report,</i> 10/5/83; col. 440]</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03395">I hope I have made the purpose of this amendment clear by linking it with the elimination of the enforcement Clauses, Nos. 2 and 3. It is these clauses that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists finds objectionable, and although the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has softened them with his amendment, the fact that parts of them stand will still be regarded as undesirable and even rather insulting by many reputable gynaecologists who have been helping women for decades by operating on this highly personal part of their bodies. They justifiably ask why it should now be necessary for every operation which they carry out on these parts of the female body suddenly to be subject to legislative scrutiny because a few "cowboy" gynaecologists, who are not even
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0370"/>
<col>725</col>
National Health Setvice consultants, have been undertaking for private gain procedures which all professional and nursing organisations regard as totally abhorrent and unacceptable. Why, in order to prevent what is admittedly a rare occurrence, should their normal professional practice be so scrutinised? I can understand why they should feel irritated and why the Department of Health and Social Security, which is perhaps closer to professional opinion and needs the co-operation of the profession, feel unhappy about the Bill as it stands.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03396">I am as interested as anyone in the House that the Bill should become law. I have supported it from the start. It will be of great help to its passage in the next Parliament if we in this House pass it now. However, to ban all operations on these parts of the body and then make exceptions is, as I think the noble Lord the Minister said, perhaps the wrong way of going about it. It is very important that today we totally eliminate these parts of the Bill which are causing problems to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Department of Health and Social Security, and simply produce the essential nugget or distillation that the Bill embodies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03397">I am fully aware that the words "for non medical reasons'. may not be the final formula which this House or another place at a later stage will decide is best, but by using this formula the spirit of the Bill will be fully understood by any court. For example, if a woman says that she is depressed because she has not had this operation which was traditional in her country, and if a doctor claims that that is a medical reason, I do not think that will he upheld in any court in this country, particularly after the very clear and forthright statement of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor on Second Reading drawing attention to the provisions of the 1861 Act relating to offences against the person.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03398">Some may say that the law is an ass, but I do not think that it is such an ass as to ignore the powerful message which this Bill embodies. What is needed is a clear statement that this operation is totally abhorrent to the people of this country and that there are severe penalties for doing it. Thanks to the researches of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, as well as to the statement of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, these are now embodied in the Bill. Twice during her remarks at Committee stage the noble Baroness used the phrase, "for non-medical reasons". No one questioned what she meant; it was clear enough to us. By cutting the Bill down to its bare essentials and leaving out the contentious enforcement clauses we shall leave those in this House and in another place during the next Parliament a sound basis on which to build if they wish. I think the Bill would serve its purpose if we amended it in the way I suggest. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03399"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Rea, covered three topics in the course of his remarks. I am not sure whether the House wishes me to follow them through, but unless anyone is against it I will address myself to all three topics in the three amendments.<lb/>
The first, and no doubt the most important, is Amendment No. 1, which proposes the addition of the
<col>726</col>
words, "for non medical reasons". The effect of this would be that any person performing this operation or these mutilations for non-medical reasons would be guilty of an offence and any person performing them for medical reasons would be within the law. Of course, everyone agrees that anything which is clearly non-medical should be banned. We have to look closely at the effect of permitting that which could be described as a medical reason.<lb/>
The noble Lord is right in saying that very little is known at present about cases that have taken place in this country. A great deal is known about one such case which has been widely and credibly reported in the press. In that case the surgeon concerned told the press, as reported:
<quote>"If someone comes in here saying they are depressed, or something, then we do it."</quote>
That means that if a surgeon, a gynaecologist or a GP&#x2014;mark you, it does not have to be a psychiatrist because we ruled psychiatrists out in Committee, and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Rea, does not want them back in&#x2014;decides that a woman is clinically in a state of depression, the question arises: is an operation to improve that state of depression medical or non-medical?<lb/>
The next question that arises is: is depression an illness, and is its treatment a medical matter or not? If we are to maintain that depression is not an illness and that treatment of depression is not a medical procedure, we are ruling out a very large part of a medical practice in advanced countries at the moment. Of course depression is an illness; of course its treatment is medical; and of course those who want to do these operations will plead that in court if they are charged, and thereby we shall write a very large loophole into the Bill.<lb/>
I now refer to Amendment No. 2, in my name, which is an alternative to the "non medical" of the noble Lord, Lord Rea. The House will see that there is a better way of helping to overcome the objections which have been raised by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. I do not want to confuse the issue by talking about Amendment No. 2 at the moment, but would simply ask the noble Lord, Lord Rea, whether he would be prepared not to press Amendment No. 1, and I shall then proceed with Amendment No. 2 and hope to convince the House that that is the right way to do it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03400"><member>Baroness Hornsby-Smith</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, because this would otherwise leave a dangerous loophole. I do not want to repeat what I said on Second Reading. Indeed, I have the highest admiration for the distinguished gentlemen who make up the hierarchy of our royal medical colleges, but they were born and bred with ethics which existed in a period when they never had to deal with this problem because it was not acceptable or in any way natural in this country.<lb/>
Overall, these operations will be done by doctors who were born in countries where it was the practice to perform the circumcision of females, and they will in the main, as Lord Hatch of Lusby pointed out last time, be more likely to be carried out as back-street abortions for a price. To protect themselves, they will of course say that it was medically necessary. Although
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0371"/>
<col>727</col>
I appreciate the objections of the members of the Royal Colleges, I think we have also to consider those who will do this for a price, or under great pressure from parents, husbands, mothers or grandmothers, who may themselves have suffered this as a cultural and traditional custom in their own countries and who will be quite prepared to defend and support a doctor who will carry it out. I think it is far too dangerous a loophole to be introduced into the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03401"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should just like to reinforce what I said at the Committee stage about the inclusion of psychiatrists. As the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has pointed out, we accept that depression is a medical disability in this country. Although I fully appreciate the purpose of the noble Lord, Lord Rea, in putting forward this amendment, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, that it would weaken the Bill. It would create another loophole, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hornsby-Smith, has just pointed out, for a defence against the continuation of this practice. It would open the loophole that the operation had been performed for medical reasons because of the depression of the patient.<lb/>
We must be quite clear. This is a very real problem. For a considerable number of young women who come from cultures in which circumcision is an essential part of the growing up and acceptance process, the operation is considered essential for adulthood and for that acceptance. Therefore its prohibition may very well lead to acute depression, which would be of a medical nature. As I said in the Committee stage, it is in my view, the responsibility of psychiatrists to remove that depression without performing the operation of circumcision. For those reasons, I would support the rejection of Amendment No. 1, while still recognising the constructive purpose behind it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03402">12.23 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03403"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to say that of the two alternatives before your Lordships now&#x2014;and I hope that I may be forgiven for speaking both to Amendment No. 1 and to the essence of Amendment No. 2, which I think is an alternative course&#x2014;I am attracted to the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Rea. But, having said that, we should need, I think, to be clear that the words which the noble Lord proposes to include in fact achieve what they are intended to achieve. I am not entirely certain that is so in the short time in which it has been possible for me to consider these matters.<lb/>
A doubt has been cast by more than one speaker upon the efficiacy of the provision for determining the mental health of a patient. Although I do not doubt that there could be some difficulties in that particular area, I would remind your Lordships that it would be open to a court to look behind the assertion of a medical practitioner that the medical health of the patient was involved and to satisfy themselves that the surgeon was indeed justified in reaching that opinion. They can, for example, take the view of other medical experts.<lb/>
But, having said that, I fear that the difficulty that the Government find themselves in now is that we
<col>728</col>
have not been able to reach a definitive view on these matters. Although I am attracted, I must say, to the line proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Rea, I can see, too, that there are merits in the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, and must therefore leave it to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03404"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, may I just ask him to define something a little more clearly than he has done? It might leave a misapprehension. He was apparently suggesting that if there were medical psychological reasons this operation should be performed. I am sure he does not mean that. But if the patient were in such a state of depression (as I pointed out that many patients could be if they were prevented from having the operation) presumably the noble Lord and the Government would still not wish her to have this operation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03405"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord will recall from earlier stages, there is most certainly a form of operation on these parts of the female anatomy which could indeed be rendered necessary by psychological considerations, and quite properly so as well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03406"><member>Baroness Hornsby-Smith</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Minister sits down, he said that it would be for the courts to pursue the investigation, but I cannot see the practicality of that happening. The girl is frightened by the cultural pressure of her family, and indeed perhaps by faith in the procedures in which she has been bred. The father will not report the doctor. The doctor will certainly not report himself. The only cases likely to come before the court would be those which resulted in some form of medical disaster&#x2014;septicaemia or something of that sort&#x2014;where the girl had to go to a National Health Service hospital and then it was investigated. Otherwise, I cannot see any reason why such a case should come to court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03407"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was seeking to encompass the sort of problem which I think the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has sought to encompass in the amendment that he has to follow this one on the Order Paper: that is to say, the rectification of abnormality. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, who, at an earlier stage, described the circumstances where this might be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03408"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if that is what the noble Lord has in mind, that and that alone would be covered by Amendment No. 2. Amendment No. 1 of course would cover any kind of depression, or any kind of subjective judgment by any GP anyway.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03409"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having heard both arguments, I am entirely persuaded by those of the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, and of the noble Baroness, Lady Hornsby-Smith.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03410"><member>Lord Rea</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have no wish to press the amendment, but I should like to say one or two things. First, of course depression is a medical matter, but I wonder whether it is a surgical matter. Very occasionally lobotomy&#x2014;that is, an operation on the brain&#x2014;has been justified as a treatment for severe depression, but I am not sure that operations on other
<image src="S5LV0442P0I0372"/>
<col>729</col>
parts of the body can be taken as legitimate treatments or operations.<lb/>
I do not wish to take this any further now, but at a later stage I think it would be possible, by means of a codicil or schedule&#x2014;I am not a parliamentary draftsman&#x2014;to define completely clearly, with professional advice, which operations are medical and which are not medical, and have these stated in the Bill, though not necessarily as part of one of the main clauses. My Lords, I withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>Page 1, line 23, after ("person") insert ("or for the rectification of abnormality").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03415">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rea, for withdrawing the amendment after discussion. As he, and the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, rightly said, Amendment No. 2 is an alternative. It seeks to meet the doubts of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on what appears to be the most important part of the area, without opening a very broad loophole, as the "non-medical" phrase would have done. That is the question of trimming, to lay it out quite plainly. It is contended, with what validity I do not know, that a depression, which is surely a medical matter, can be alleviated, or removed, if it is associated with the conviction on the part of, typically, a young woman or girl, that her labia majora are too large. For the purpose of permitting such operations at the discretion of doctors in the ordinary way, as they have traditionally been done for a long time, I have adopted the phrase,
<quote>"or for the rectification of abnormality".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03416">I think that that is likely to be the most common abnormality to be rectified, if this amendment is adopted. There are of course other, much grosser, ones, which it might have been held would have been forbidden by the words formerly in the Bill, though I cannot imagine that they actually would have been, because surely their rectification would have been for the physical health of the patient. But in order to put the matter beyond doubt, I have suggested this formulation, which I commend to the House.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03423"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: No, it is not a waste of time, as noble Lords will find if they are courteous enough to hear me out. In his opening remarks the noble Lord, Lord Rea, asked, why should the normal operations of doctors and surgeons be subject to increased scrutiny simply because a few "cowboy" gynaecologists do something abhorrent? The reason why they should be subject to increased scrutiny is that a few "cowboy" gynaecologists and surgeons do something abhorrent. Among those who do these operations are qualified people, and it is in order to prevent qualified people from doing them that I have drafted the Bill so that it has a few teeth in it&#x2014;not very many, but a few. If there were no qualified persons doing these operations, it would not have been necessary to have a Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord. Lord Rea, also touched on the Lord Chancellor's intervention at an earlier stage, and I should like, if I may, to say a few words about that. Of course, nobody in this House now can have a judgment to compare with the Lord Chancellor's about whether or not these operations are already illegal under the nineteenth century legislation. I merely notice that the evidence has been public and has been publicised since October 1982 that one of these operations was carried out in April 1981. I stated this on Second Reading, and informed the House that I had in my possession incontestable documentary evidence of that fact. No prosecution has been brought. Nobody has approached me for that evidence&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03425"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the effect of the amendment is to remove all the teeth from the Bill and to make it merely a declaratory one. I was giving the reasons for desiring to keep in the teeth.<lb/>
At this stage I should point out to the House that all the copies of the Bill which have been circulated to noble Lords are wrong. What has been circulated is the Bill as passed on Second Reading. What should have been circulated was the Bill as amended in Committee. The wrong Bill is marked "(102)" in the bottom left-hand corner. The right Bill is marked "(170)" in the bottom left-hand corner. If any noble Lord has not a copy of the right Bill, I do not think that it matters too much, but I should simply like to avoid possible confusion in later amendments by pointing that out at this stage.<lb/>
I am glad that the noble Lord has not moved his amendment, and because I want the Bill to have one or two minimal teeth, I shall now, with the leave of the House, withdraw the amendment&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03437"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, just before we now read the Bill a third time, I think that I would not wish to leave you Lordships under any misapprehension that the Bill passing, as I presume it will in a moment, is actually passed in accordance with Government approval. We have not expressed a formal view on the merits, or otherwise, of the Bill. Of course we agree with the principle which the noble Lord has adduced, but we have considerable reservations about some of the provisions of the Bill, and I should not wish your Lordships to be of any other view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03438"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may take the opportunity to say so, of course I acknowledge the objective truth of what the noble Lord has said. But there was the usual gap between First Reading and Second Reading, and there was the usual gap between Second Reading and Committee stage. The noble Lord has personally been most courteous to me throughout. I have been in touch with him throughout. But it is the case that the Government have not been able to give me any very firm advice on what to do, let alone to provide any formulations of their own&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03439"><member>The Deputy Speaker (Lord Nugent of Guildford)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question before the House is that the Bill he now read a third time.</membercontribution></p>

<col>732</col>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03444"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was content to make my remarks on this Motion, as the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, was to make them on the Motion before it; I do not really see the distinction. I should like to set it on the record that, though I am grateful for the personal courtesy of the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, I regret that the Government have not been able to give any constructive help to the formulation of the Bill so far. Of course, it will not become law when it goes out of this House, and if it is to become law it will be necessary to reintroduce it in the next Parliament. I hope that the labours of the House on the three stages that we have had will not prove to have been wasted and that the Bill will be in a better condition than it would have been had it not been carried forward to concluding its passsage through this House.<lb/>
Lastly, I wish to thank all those noble Lords who have worked on the Bill, spoken on it, and improved it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03445"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord the Minister&#x2014;to whose courtesy the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has paid tribute&#x2014;assure the House that during the next four weeks his department will do some work on the Bill? As the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, has pointed out, the Second Reading took place on 21st April. The only excuse that the noble Lord the Minister has given for being unable to respond on behalf of the Government is the panic of last weekend. That is a very feeble excuse for a department that has had since 21st April to consider its attitude to the Bill.<lb/>
Can the noble Lord therefore give us some assurance that when the next Parliament meets the Government will be in a position to associate themselves with those of us who have taken the trouble to put the Bill before the House so that the measure can be moved speedily through the House with the Government's consent and with the principle to which the Government agree put into practical textual form to enable it to be passed from this House to the other place with the Government's blessing?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03446"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if it is in order to respond to that point, there are two matters that I should mention. First, the Bill that we are now considering is not going to become law. The Government's view on some future Bill that might be introduced in some future Parliament will have to be expressed when that Bill is introduced. I am not of course certain that anyone proposes to reintroduce the Bill or even whether the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, proposes to do so.<lb/>
As for the time taken to reach a Government view on the matter, the consultation has to go a good deal wider than within my department. Ministers have to reach a collective opinion on the matter not only in accordance with the views of their officials but also having regard to the views of a wide range of professional and other opinion outside the department and in the country at large.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Motion for Adjournment</title>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03448">12.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03449"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before moving that the House do adjourn, I should like, as has become customary, to say a word or two. We have been through a Session rather shorter than we originally expected. That does not mean to say that the Session has not been an extremely tiring one. I think that it has been. I should like to thank all noble Lords in all parts of the House for the courtesy and the patience they have shown. We have, on occasion, asked the House to work rather harder than is usual. I shall not be alone in mentioning the help and support received from everyone who serves the House in the building. In spite of the extra difficulties and the extra strain, they have been unfailing in their courtesy, their willingness and their helpfulness. We are all grateful. I should like to wish your Lordships in all parts of the House a pleasant Recess. I look forward with confidence to seeing all Members of the House back in their accustomed places in June.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03450"><member>Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord moves for the last time in this Parliament that the House do adjourn&#x2014;I should also like to hope that it will be for the last time&#x2014;may I join him in thanking all members of staff and all those who have supported the staff in this tiring Session. I hope that the next Session will not be so tiring; but I can give no promises of what form of legislation an incoming Government might produce for the House. Indeed, the new Session might be even more tiring. However, we join the noble Lord in his remarks concerning the support that we have received from the staff of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03451"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to associate these Benches with what has been said about the staff. As regards the future Parliament, all I can say is that if we are confronted, as may happen, by a Government intent on abolishing this House, we may have more work to do than was contemplated. As to the staff, I am sure that we all pay the greatest tribute to their devoted assistance. Their work&#x2014;often in the middle of the night when most of us, including myself, are safely in bed&#x2014;is beyond praise. I suppose the only satisfaction is that they undoubtedly serve what, in my view&#x2014;and I am sure the view of many of your Lordships&#x2014;is the most efficient Second Chamber in the world in its revision of legislation and in constantly giving wise advice to the Government, perhaps even on a non-party basis. With those remarks, I hope that we shall come back, perhaps in a slightly less cantankerous mood, in a month's time. It is certainly possible that places may have changed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03452"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I associate those who sit on this Bench with all&#x2014;or almost all&#x2014;that has been stated. It is a pleasure to be able to put on a party hat and to be nice, having worn a non-party hat and been rather nasty just now. I agree with all that has been stated about the service given to us by the staff. It has been beyond praise throughout the Parliament. I wish all noble Lords on all sides of the House a very pleasant election campaign&#x2014;although not of course equal wishes for success.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03456">Whether they appreciate that members of the public are anxious to know the answer to Lord Avebury's Question "whether the documents withdrawn from the Public Record Office concerning the issue of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands will he returned before the general election"; whether they are aware of the disappointment caused by their statement in reply (<i>Hansard,</i> col. 458) that documents are returned when they are no longer required: and whether they will now answer the question with greater particularity.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03459">Whether they are aware that drainage works have been started on two further areas of exceptional wildlife interest in the Somerset Levels, King's Sedgemoor and Curry Moor, areas recognised by both the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) and the Somerset County Council as being of sufficient importance to be designated SSSI's, and whether they will immediately instruct the NCC to apply for a Section 29 order under the Wildlife and Countryside Act to cover all the areas of SSSI quality on the Somerset Levels that are not yet notified as SSSI's.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03460"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member>: I am aware that some recent drainage work has taken place on King's Sedgemoor and Curry Moor in Somerset. I understand that Somerset County Council will be identifying certain areas as being of exceptional wildlife interest in their Somerset Levels and Moors Plans, which is due to be published this summer, and that a number of areas, including King's Sedgemoor, are also being considered by NCC for possible notification as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. It is for the NCC to advise us if they consider that orders under Section 29 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act are necessary for any area which meets the criteria laid down in the Act.</p>

<title>LAND DRAINAGE AND THE<lb/> WILDLIFE AND COUNTRYSIDE ACT</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03461"><member>Lord Melchett</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03462">Whether they agree that the current drainage work on King's Sedgemoor and Curry Moor on the Somerset Levels, following the recent destruction of the wildlife interest by the drainage of part of Tealham and Tadham Moor, demonstrates clearly that the "voluntary principle" on which the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was based is totally ineffectual.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03463"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member>: The provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to which the noble Lord alludes apply only to notified SSSIs and to proposed SSSIs where the Nature Conservancy Council has given notice of its intention to notify to owners and occupiers. None of the sites mentioned falls into either category.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03464">The "voluntary principle" in nature conservation matters, so far from being ineffectual, is the only realistic and effective approach. It would be impracticable to muster the army of bureaucrats that would be needed to undertake the detailed supervision of agricultural operations, including such matters as the number of sheep permitted to graze in particular areas, that would be needed to impose countrywide restrictions through planning machinery. Even if this negative control could be achieved, it would alienate the rural community and forfeit the active co-operation that is essential if the landscape and wildlife habitats of Britain, which were created by man's actions, are to be maintained. The irresponsible threat of replacing voluntary co-operation by compulsion&#x2014;even though it could not be implemented&#x2014;could well make some farmers feel obliged in their children's interests to destroy natural features of their land while the opportunity remained open to them, even if they had had no previous intention of doing so. Compulsion, or even the threat of compulsion, would do irreparable harm to our natural heritage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03465"><member>Lord Melchett</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03466">Whether the Lower Bure Internal Drainage Board (IDB) in Somerset has received a copy of the guidelines issued to statutory undertakers explaining the procedures to be followed under Section 48 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and whether they agree that the IDB's refusal to co-operate with the Nature Conservancy Council over the Board's activities on Tealham and Tadham Moor on the Somerset Levels means that is in breach of Section 48 of the Act.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03467"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Earl Ferrers)</member>: Copies of the Guidance Notes on the procedures to be followed under Section 22 of the Water Act 1973 as amended by Section 48 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 were sent to all Internal Drainage Boards, including the Lower Bure IDB, on 9th November 1982.</p>

<title>TEALHAM AND TADHAM MOORS:<lb/> DRAINAGE CONSULTATIONS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03469"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03470">Whether the owners on Tealham and Tadham Moors (Somerset) who have recently completed field drainage on their land were advised or assisted by the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service or Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials prior to commencing these drainage works, and, if so, whether these officials notified the NCC of the proposed works in view of the NCC's known interest in this area.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03471"><member>Earl Ferrers</member>: Advice from Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) officers was sought on some of the recent drainage operations on Tealham and Tadham Moors. Where the farmers concerned had not already done so, they were urged to consult with the Nature Conservancy Council, or to permit ADAS to consult the Nature Conservancy Council on their behalf, before the proposed operations were undertaken. It would not have been proper for ADAS officers to breach the confidence, which is entrusted to them by farmers, with whom the ultimate responsibility must rest for consulting with the Nature Conservancy Council about their proposed operation.</p>

<p id="S5LV0442P0-03473">Whether they are aware that General Altenburg of the West German Bundeswehr has said "Nuclear first use can strike one target somewhere as a political signal and doesn't necessarily mean a transition to battlefield nuclear war in the Federal Republic of Germany" and whether, were such a statement made by a Soviet General, they would not condemn it as indicating a readiness to begin the nuclear escalation process leading to a holocaust.</p>
<p id="S5LV0442P0-03474"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member>: I refer the noble Lord to the full transcript of General Altenburg's interview, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House.
