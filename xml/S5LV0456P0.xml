<title>The Miners' Strike: Costs</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00298"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00299">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00300">To ask Her Majesty's Government how they intend to finance the cost of the coal industry dispute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00301"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Glenarthur)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no decision has yet been taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00302"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, since no decision has yet been taken, will the noble Lord inform the House whether he is aware of the reports that have appeared in the responsible press over the past three weeks, some of which may have come indirectly from Government departments, that there is going to be a surcharge on electricity bills in order to pay for the costs of the miners' strike? May I also ask the noble Lord to answer this question. When considering this matter, will Her Majesty's Government bear in mind that on 31st July last, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking in the House of Commons on this subject, said that the costs of the strike represented a worthwhile national investment? Will the noble Lord say whether, if that be the case, the whole country would care to participate in that investment rather than the consumers of electricity being required to contribute to any such cost?</membercontribution></p>
<col>2</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00303"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is surmising at what might be done. I refer the noble Lord to the Answer that I gave, which was that no decision has been taken. So far as the surcharge on electricity bills is concerned, this is entire speculation on behalf of the noble Lord opposite. What my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced at the end of July was that expenditure was then between some &#x00A3;300 million to &#x00A3;350 million. I have no more up-to-date figures at the present time to give the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00304"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord for that Answer, may I ask whether he can say if the contingency fund, or some of it, would be available for this purpose?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00305"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the reserve to which the noble Lord refers is set at &#x00A3;2&#x00BE; billion in last year's public expenditure White Paper. So far, programme increases amounting to some &#x00A3;&#x00BE; billion have have been charged to the reserve to meet part of the cost of various other items. There are other potential charges, of which I suppose the miners' strike is one, but amounts are less certain. The total position is being monitored closely.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00306"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord assure the House that when the decision to which he has referred is taken, or before that decision is taken, he will draw the attention of his honourable and right honourable friends to the fact that as long ago as last February, in a report prepared for the present Chancellor of the Exchequer when he was energy Minister, Coopers and Lybrand found that electricity was already being overcharged by up to 10 per cent?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00307"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a matter for those who made that assessment. I am sure that that has been noted by my right honourable friend but I do not have that particular statement in front of me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00308"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord say whether the &#x00A3;300 million is the total cost to all Government departments, to all local authorities and to all those individuals who have lost their earnings?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0010"/>
<col>3</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00309"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those figures that I gave related to the expenditure that had then been incurred. It is not quite what the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, would understand as a book figure because, if we take the total overall cost figure, the figure that I gave is reduced by the stock rundown and cut back in capital investment programmes. So the figures will not actually show up in the profit and loss account. However, I hope that answers the noble Lord's point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00310"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord saying that the &#x00A3;300 million does not include any police costs, any damage which has been done one way or the other, extra expenses to the local authorities, and so on?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00311"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it includes those costs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00312"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it be the intention of Her Majesty's Government, when this decision is made, to issue a White Paper setting out clearly what the Government understand by the word "costs"? There are direct costs, there are indirect costs; there is cash expenditure; there is damage; and there are various other items. It is obviously in the public interest to know exactly what is the total and how the Government view it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00313"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that those responsible will note the noble Lord's remarks. I am well aware of the noble Lord's particular interest and experience in financial matters. The fact is that it is best to wait until the end of the day to establish exactly what has been the total cost.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00314"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would this question not be better aimed at the conscience of the President of the National Union of Mineworkers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00315"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that my noble friend is quite right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00316"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in case the question of surcharging the electricity consumer may be one of the options that is considered by the noble Lord's right honourable friends, may I ask this question? Will the noble Lord bear in mind the remarks of his colleague, the noble Earl, Lord Avon, last year, to which I have already referred, when he said that the Government had no powers or no wish to raise the power prices? Will the noble Lord give the House an assurance that the legalities of the position under the electricity Acts are thoroughly examined? Otherwise there may be a temptation to advise electricity consumers that any extra demands made upon them are illegal and that they should refuse to pay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00317"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the noble Lord will realise that the Government will of course act within the law when it comes to considering what is to be done about the costs. As I have said, no decisions on electricity price increases have been taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00318"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend agree that, in the end, regrettable, heavy extra
<col>4</col>
Government expenditure of this kind can only be recouped either from the consumer or the taxpayer? Will my noble friend further agree that although this will inevitably be a large sum, it would be a much larger sum if the principle of keeping open any form of productive institution at huge losses were endorsed for all time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00319"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend. I think that he is absolutely right. The principle is an all-important one; that is why we must do all that we possibly can to ensure that this dispute is brought to a speedy conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00320"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Government consider cancelling their decision to close down 20 pits with the result of our having to import coal from Poland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00321"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the noble Lord will realise that that is a different question.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DHSS Staff: Industrial Dispute</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00322">2.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00323"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the first Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00324">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00325">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are aware of the anxiety and hardship caused to recipients and would-be recipients of social security benefits by the refusal of certain members of the staff of the Department of Health and Social Security to do the work for which they are paid; and what action it is proposed to take to remedy the position.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00326"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we all deplore the fact that the strike at Newcastle has caused such worry and inconvenience to the public. We have, however, managed to maintain a service to beneficiaries, and we are making every effort to end the dispute.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00327"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend saying that no beneficiary has been put in any difficulty as a result of this action? If he is not saying that, will he not deplore the action of people who, in order to pursue their own claims, are prepared to impose hardship on the poorest section of our community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00328"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I am not. I certainly shall from this Dispatch Box deplore the fact that people are being inconvenienced in this way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00329"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord the Minister say whether the services of ACAS have been invited to help solve this difficult dispute? Secondly, while thanking the Post Office staff for all that they have done to help pensioners over this problem, can the noble Lord say how much it is costing the Government to keep this strike going by having to make extra payments to the Post Office for the further work that they are doing? Can he give an assurance that the November benefit increases will be honoured? Will he further confirm or deny that the cost of these

<col>5</col>
new arrangements to the staff is a loss of about &#x00A3;10 to &#x00A3;14 a week? Surely, if that is the case, there must be some way of pursuing through ACAS, or by other means, a solution to what seems a very difficult dispute?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00330"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the first thing to say to the noble Baroness is that certainly in no way are we doing anything other than to try to bring the dispute to a speedy conclusion. The fact is that ACAS has been involved. The noble Baroness might like to know that this is a move unprecedented in the Civil Service and that the department remains prepared to resume negotiations at any time; and, of course, as I said earlier, we hope for a speedy settlement. I should like to join with the noble Baroness in paying tribute to the DHSS and the Post Office staff, who are making a great effort to allow us to operate the contingency arrangements.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked what were the costs of the dispute. All I can say is that the best estimate we can make is that up the end of last month the dispute had cost an extra &#x00A3;30 million to &#x00A3;40 million. When the noble Baroness says that it is only a question of a loss of &#x00A3;12 or &#x00A3;14 a week to the individuals concerned, I have to tell her that all those who are employed at this particular time, and who are affected or could be affected by the changes that have been proposed, will in fact continue to be paid at the rate that is in hand at the moment. It is only those who subsequently join and work the new arrangements who will be affected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00331"><member>Lord Stallard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord accept that those of us who are involved with the problems at the sharp end of this dispute&#x2014;I am particularly concerned about the effects on United Kingdom pensioners living overseas, who are suffering real hardship&#x2014;share his concern but do not share his complacency. Nor do we share the premise outlined in the Question. The questioner, may I say with due respect, does not appear to understand the situation. It is not the case that those on strike will not do the work for which they are paid. That is a gross oversimplification. They are being asked to do extra work, to accept different shifts and a different rota, and to accept a number of other changes not included in the Question. Will the Minister take on board, please, the suggestion of my noble friend Lady Jeger that ACAS should be called in immediately to bring the two parties together to find an acceptable solution?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00332"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said, ACAS has already been involved in the strike. As I have also said, we are prepared to resume negotiations at any time. We hope for an early settlement. The fact is that the offer made to the unions means that no existing shift workers need lose take-home pay if they accept the new arrangements. As to the effect of the dispute on overseas pensioners, I can tell the noble Lord that about 300,000 pensioners are affected, of whom approximately 70 per cent. are being paid following application to the overseas branch at Newcastle; and this figure is rising all the time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00333"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend whether, apart from the question of ACAS, in an essential service of this kind there is not
<col>6</col>
some procedure agreement or mandatory arbitration machinery?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00334"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that there is. I do not actually have the details with me. The fact is that the normal procedures were exhausted. That is why it was necessary to take the unprecedented step of involving ACAS.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00335"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister not agree that, while no one would condone activities or industrial action that create hardship at the sharp end, this problem has its roots in the fact that the present Government, two or three years ago, quite arbitrarily, abrogated long-standing agreements with the Civil Service unions over this type of employee involvement? That is where the roots of the dispute lie. Had we kept to those agreements, there would be no need to involve ACAS.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00336"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I would not accept what the noble Lord says. In this dispute the unions appear to want the existing shift patterns to be set for all time. Obviously, this questions management's right to manage. This is something that the department cannot, and should not, accept.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00337"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware, in the light of the supplementary question put two questions ago from the Benches opposite, that the people concerned are refusing to carry out the duties they have been asked to carry out, and in pursuit of their standpoint are apparently quite prepared to inflict a great deal of hardship on people much poorer than themselves?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00338"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes; I agree entirely with my noble friend. I have had a vast amount of correspondence on the subject. Many people have been very distressed by it. Nevertheless, I think it is true that the emergency arrangements which we put in train for these occasions have been working better and better as time has gone by. I only hope, as I said earlier, that the strike can be brought to a speedy conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00339"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise for asking another question, but the noble Lord the Minister has said that ACAS is involved. Can he tell the House whether ACAS has put forward some definite proposition, and which side has refused to agree to it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00340"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would take me more than a minute or two to go into the details for the noble Baroness, but I should be very happy to correspond with her on this particular point. The fact is that recently&#x2014;only last week&#x2014;my department wrote yet again to the general secretary of CPSA outlining the various factors which were involved and hoping that it would be possible to make some sensible progress. I have not got in front of me the details of the ACAS arrangements, but I can say, yes, ACAS has been involved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00341"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the admitted excellent work carried out by sub-post offices in this situation, would not the Government agree that
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0012"/>
<col>7</col>
it is necessary to review the threatened closure of many sub-post offices which are at present of enormous advantage to the old-age pensioners?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00342"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are getting fairly wide of the mark on this, but the Post Office has announced that it would be wrong to close post offices while the additional work resulting from the dispute, which the Post Office estimates at some 25 per cent., was causing long queues and increased waiting times. Further closure of Crown offices will therefore be deferred until the dispute and its aftermath have been resolved. Similarly, in regard to sub-postmasters who have agreed to closure, the Post Office will be seeking to persuade as many as possible to remain open until the dispute is resolved.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Diplomatic Immunity for Alleged Offenders</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00344">2.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00345"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the second Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00346">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00347">To ask Her Majesty's Government in how many cases in the last 12 months have allegations of the commission of a criminal offence not been proceeded with by reason of a claim to diplomatic immunity on the part of the alleged offender.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00348"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have received police reports of 38 serious offences allegedly committed by diplomats since 1st October 1983. "Serious" is defined as applying to any offence in a category where the maximum sentence could in certain circumstances be six months or more imprisonment, although very few of the 38 would in fact have incurred any custodial sentence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00349"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Lord for that reply I should like to ask him whether he can confirm that at any rate most of those 38 offences are offences other than traffic offences. Can he also confirm one's impression that there has been a proliferation in diplomatic staffs in London, in particular from the newer countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00350"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the present number of diplomatic staff in London enjoying full diplomatic immunity is 4,538. That does not include dependent family members forming a part of the immune person's household. I think that my right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary gave further details when he addressed the Foreign Affairs Committee. No, I am mistaken; it was my noble friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lady Young, when she addressed the Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee on 30th July last. I wonder whether my noble friend will allow me to send him some details of that.</membercontribution></p>
<col>8</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00351"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord will be good enough to tell us what progress has been made in the review of the Vienna Convention, about which there was a great deal of discussion some weeks ago. Secondly, is it the case that his right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has sent a letter to the heads of missions in London about this matter, and is it the case that he has told them that the rules under the Vienna Convention will be applied more rigorously in future? Can the noble Lord say what is the reaction to that of the heads of missions or, indeed, their governments?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00352"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords; it is the case that recently the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote to heads of missions along the lines that the noble Lord has mentioned. I do not think that we expected any formal response to that communication, except perhaps more scrupulous observance of our laws.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00353"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in order to place before the House some kind of balance on the mutuality, or want of it, in regard to the Vienna Convention, can the noble Lord the Minister give any indication to the House about the number of occasions over the past 10 years on which the United Kindom or its representatives have claimed immunity for our own officials in order to prevent a possible prosecution for criminal offences?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00354"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, until recently records were kept only in individual personal files and there was no central record. However, a recent survey of records at overseas posts has revealed that in the last 10 years, as it happens, nine diplomatic service officers escaped prosecution for offences other than minor traffic violations, such as parking offences, by virtue of their immunity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00355"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the noble Lord the Minister agree that there seems to be a lack of balance in these matters?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00356"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that must be self-evident from the answers which I have given. It does, I suppose, indicate what a high standard of behaviour we have come to expect, and get, from our diplomatic officers serving overseas, but it may also be a reflection of the very considerable size of the diplomatic community in London.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Nationalised Industries and Price Rises</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00357">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00358"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00359">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00360">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have issued any guidelines to the chairmen of nationalised industries concerning the notice period given prior to any implementation of price rises and any absence of prior consultation.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0013"/>
<col>9</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00361"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no general guidelines have been issued, but in some cases there is a statutory requirement for industries to consult consumer interests before changes in tariffs are implemented. Additionally, I understand that non-statutory arrangements for consultation exist in a number of industries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00362"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister can comment on something concerning British Telecom and the fact that increased telephone charges are to come into effect next month. My information is that prior consultation with users did not take place and that the very short notice before the charges come into effect has greatly been deplored. Secondly, can the noble Lord tell the House what were the profits of British Telecom as at 31st March this year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00363"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Baroness is hinting that BT may not have complied with the conditions of its licence in terms of the recently announced prices increases, I have to tell her that this is a matter for the Director General of Telecommunications. British Telecommunications' profits were &#x00A3;990 million in 1983&#x2013;84.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00364"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the first part of his reply is really disgraceful in that the consumer associations were not consulted at all on this matter? May I ask him whether he is aware that the public statement issued by British Telecom stated that the telephone increases were to achieve&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;"a sounder financial footing"? To most of us, a figure of &#x00A3;990 million profit is a pretty sound financial footing. How much more would the Minister suggest is needed before that is reached? Finally, before he answers me on this matter of the nationalised industries, I should like to ask him whether he is aware that British Gas had an operating profit at 31st March this year of &#x00A3;667.9 million, and that the electricity industry had an operating profit of &#x00A3;901 million. Are consumers to go on paying, however enormous these profits are?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00365"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the fact that British Telecom made a profit of &#x00A3;990 million has to be seen in the context of the rate of return that that represents upon the net current cost assets employed. I think, too, that the noble Baroness will realise that when we are talking about a profit of &#x00A3;990 million for BT, BT's massive investments and the massive scale of its business requirements are such that that kind of profit is not as extravagant or as vast as the noble Baroness suggests it is. The fact is that BT accounted for some 2 per cent. of the income-based gross domestic product in 1983. That is a very substantial amount. I think that the figures which I have quoted simply illustrate the fact that the investment and the size of the operation are so enormous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00366"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that his answers only fully justify the contentions which were put forward at the time of the Telecommunications Bill and various other privatisation Bills that the reason prices were being forced upwards was so that the Government could
<col>10</col>
subsequently privatise these assets at the expense of the taxpayer in order to yield a satisfactory return for their <i>rentier</i> friends?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00367"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I remember having many exchanges with the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, over the passage of that Bill. As he will know, BT is a public limited company. It is wholly owned by the Government, operating under the terms and conditions of a licence granted by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. There are restrictions on the extent to which BT can increase the prices of certain of its telephone services, but those controls are monitored and enforced by the Director General of Telecommunications.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00368"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend recall that when the nationalised industries made vast losses, the Government used to be upbraided from all sides of the House? Now that the nationalised industries are making profits, it appears that they are upbraided only by noble Lords opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00369"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is quite right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00370"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that all these facts&#x2014;and I call them facts&#x2014;that he quotes really cut no ice at all with the ordinary consumer, who is absolutely convinced that these enormous profits should in some way mitigate the charges to consumers? Does the noble Lord recall&#x2014;although he himself did not answer the Question&#x2014;that we raised this matter as regards the electricity charges earlier this year, and is he aware that we shall be returning to the matter next week, when I hope he will have a better reply?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00371"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in that case I had better wait until next week, but I shall look forward to what the noble Baroness has to say then.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00372"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not my noble friend agree that, as privatisation is a very important part of the Government's policy, in order to avoid the misconceptions which have been shown in the questions which he has been asked so far, ought not the profits to be shown in terms of profits per share? Until the return on a share justifies people investing, we shall not get the investment&#x2014;and it is investment that we need in order to deal with the unemployment figures. Ought not that presentation to be looked at as a way of making quite clear to the public the true nature of the business dealings?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00373"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that my noble friend is quite right. Off the top of my head I am not quite clear how precisely it could be done, but I should have thought that this is a matter which could be given consideration by the industries concerned, particularly when they produce rather easily understood glossy brochures illustrating exactly what their profits have been. I am sure that they will bear my noble friend's remarks in mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00374"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord is not in agreement with my noble friend as to the adequacy of
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0014"/>
<col>11</col>
this service, why does he not tell us what is the return on the assets, and then we could form our own judgment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00375"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can tell the noble Lord that in regard to the electricity industry the rate of return was about 2 per cent. and I think that the figure for the gas industry was about 5 per cent., but I might need to check on that.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Ordnance Factories and Military Services Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00377">3.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00378"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have it in command from Her Majesty the Queen to acquaint the House that Her Majesty, having been informed of the purport of the Ordnance Factories and Military Services Bill, has consented to place her prerogative and interests, so far as they are affected by the Bill, at the disposal of Parliament for the purposes of the Bill.<lb/>
Bill read a third time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00379">Clause 3 [<i>Operation of schemes</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00380"><member>Baroness Vickers</member> moved Amendment No. 1:
<quote>Page 5, line 3, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("( ) The Secretary of State shall make a report annually to both Houses of Parliament, and allow time for its debate in both Houses, on progress made on the disposal of any securities issued to him under section 1 (2).").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00381">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move the amendment which stands in my name on the Marshalled List. I realise that my noble friend may not be prepared to agree to this amendment being written into the Bill. However, I would be grateful if he would agree that it would be possible to have a report annually to both Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00382">My reason for making this request is that the Secretary of State can decide at least 17 times what action can be taken, independent of Parliament. Also, he can decide many times with the Treasury's consent or after consulting the Treasury. A Minister of the Crown can also decide several times. Under Clause 5:
<quote>"The Secretary of State may not dispose of any securities or rights acquired under this section unless the disposal is made with the Treasury's consent &#x2026;</quote>
<quote>Any expenses incurred by the Secretary of State or the Treasury in consequence of this section shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament".</quote></p>
<col>12</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00383">Clause 7(9) states:
<quote>"A statutory instrument containing an order under this section shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00384">Clause 15 deals with repeal, and subsection (2) says:
<quote>"The power to make an order under this section shall be exercisable by statutory instrument, and no such order shall be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before and approved by resolution of the House of Commons".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00385">As I understood it, statutory instruments usually had to go before a Joint Committee of Members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords before they could be approved by both Houses. It appears to me that the Commons may have a better chance of safeguarding the industry for the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00386">I still consider that to do away with these Royal Ordnance factories and to privatise them will cause damage to Britain's defence, and it is unfortunate that an organisation with 300 years of excellent work and three Queen's Awards should have its future changed. On 19th July the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, made pledges in regard to the pensions and said that the Government would continue to negotiate with the trade unions about them. The noble Lord said that they would continue to negotiate. I should like to see the matter settled before the Bill is passed. Will the Minister agree today to ensure that an unequivocal commitment in regard to pensions is written into the Bill? Will the Minister state that the arrangements made for existing employees who transfer to the new company on vesting day will not be different from those for new employees after vesting day?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00387">I should like to pay tribute to the Royal Ordnance factories' workforce, who have served the nation well for 300 years. If he had had the chance to visit the factories during the war, as I did, the Minister would have seen the excellent work carried out, sometimes under very difficult conditions, by this workforce. I hope that the noble Lord will pay tribute to the part which they have played for over 300 years to keep Britain a free, democratic country. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00388"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like fully to support the noble Baroness, Lady Vickers. This is a very reasonable and moderate amendment. We agree completely with much of what has been said as regards the genesis of the Bill or the philosophy behind it. We are agin it. But this amendment is not talking about the Bill: it is talking about the Minister coming to the House once a year and telling us the progress or otherwise that he has made in disposing of the assets.<lb/>
We want a report and a debate. A debate means a discussion. I do not know the parliamentary device that will be used, the peg upon which we shall hang it; but if we are in the process of discussing the dissolution of the Royal Ordnance factories' arrangements then it is reasonable to ask that once a year the Minister should come to the House and tell us how he is getting on, what the problems have been, what the asset realisation has been and so on. This is a very reasonable amendment. In this House the Minister has refused to accept any amendment whatever from this side. He has had amendments forced upon him. This amendment gives the Minister the chance of a lifetime to show that he is reasonable.</membercontribution></p>

<col>13</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00389"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may detain the House for one minute on this matter. I think that we ought to be satisfied with the many assurances that the Government have given about the objects of privatising the Royal Ordnance factories, which I know to be entirely positive and which are entirely aimed at ensuring that the Royal Ordnance factories flourish as suppliers, not only of Her Majesty's forces in this country, but as is necessary in today's market, of the requirements of allies of Her Majesty's Government abroad. I am quite and entirely satisfied that this has to be done in the private sector and that, in addition to the many Government assurances on the positive nature of their intentions in any privatisation that takes place, there are natural controlling factors which ensure that the long-term interests of the Government, the Royal Ordnance factories themselves and the armed services are bound to coincide in making sure that positive and secure arrangements are made for the future wellbeing of this great organisation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00390"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the outset let me hasten to associate myself with the words of praise which my noble friend directed towards the workforce of the Royal Ordnance factories. I perfectly understand my noble friend's desire that Parliament should be kept aware of what is happening with regard to the privatisation of the new Royal Ordnance company. My noble friend moved an amendment on Report which would have required any disposal of shares in the new company to be authorised by an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. I explained then that such a requirement would not be practicable, since the details of a flotation could not be finally fixed until a very short time before the offer for sale; and the date of the offer for sale would be variable, since it would depend on many factors. On the other hand, any debate which took place well in advance of a flotation would be lacking those details which Parliament would undoubtedly wish to have. I said that the Government would announce their intention before privatisation took place, and we would do this as close as possible to the event. Any noble Lord who wished to ask questions arising out of such a statement would, of course, be free to do so. It seems to me that this would be much the best way of handling the matter.<lb/>
My noble friend withdrew her amendment on Report, and now replaces it with this one. On its face the amendment is not restricted to the period during which the Secretary of State holds all the shares in the company. Is it the intention that he should be bound to lay an annual report even while he holds a minority of shares&#x2014;from which he might at some time or another make further disposals? If so, this obligation could endure for the foreseeable future, long after privatisation takes place. I doubt that my noble friend intends this, but that would be the effect of her amendment as it stands. Clearly, the Government could not accept an obligation of that kind.<lb/>
In any case, I do not think that an annual report to Parliament is likely to be very informative. Between vesting day, when the new company gets started in business, and the flotation of shares on the market, progress will&#x2014;I hope&#x2014;be steady, but it will not be
<col>14</col>
spectacular. There is unlikely to be any more information to put in an annual report than would be found in the report which the company will, like most public companies, issue in any event. Any noble Lord may question Government Ministers on any matter arising out of such a report or, indeed, out of the activities of the company generally. I cannot see that anything at all is to be gained from a formal requirement of the kind which this amendment seeks.<lb/>
I repeat that the Government will announce their intentions regarding privatisation as fully and completely as possible close to, but in good time before, the privatisation, by whatever method that might take place. This is, after all, the usual way of handling these things. Why do we need some more elaborate process? I see nothing so unusual in this case which would justify so radical a departure from the normal course. I hope my noble friend will, on reflection, think that what I have said is not unreasonable. I understand the point she has been making, but I thought that my undertaking regarding a Government announcement to Parliament would meet her concerns. I am sorry if it does not, but I fear that the Government cannot accept what is proposed by this amendment. Therefore, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00391"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister think again as regards what he said about this being a very unusual thing to ask the Government to do? The Government are acting as a steward and the noble Baroness, Lady Vickers, is suggesting that the Goverment should account for their stewardship from time to time and, instead of leaving the time open and vague, that they should account for their stewardship once a year. No specific date is given, and whether it is a week earlier or later than the anniversary of the last report would not matter very much. But at all events, there would be a report. There must be dozens of other reports which the Government lay before Parliament because of the stewardship which Parliament has given them. What is unusual about that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00392"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I have your Lordships' permission to speak again, I would say that all that is fairly conjectural. We do not know how long the Secretary of State will be in the position under which the amendment would require him to make such a report. Indeed, as I said earlier, it is not clear from the amendment how long my noble friend had in mind. I believe that the process of the company making its own report in a form with which we are now very familiar is the right way in which to proceed with this matter, and I hope that my noble friend will now think so, too.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00397">3.18 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00398"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member> moved Amendment No. 2:
<quote>Page 5, line 15, leave out subsection (9) and insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("(9) Not less than six weeks before the day on which a scheme comes into force, the Secretary of State shall lay before Parliament a copy of the scheme but omitting any material the disclosure of which he considers would be contrary to national security or to the commercial interest of any person, and such copy shall include any Memoradum of Understanding entered into by a Minister of the Crown and the Chairman of the Board of any Company referred to in subsection (4) describing the relationship between the Government as shareholder and any such Chairman.")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00399">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 2 standing in my name and that of my noble friend. This amendment was given an airing at the Report stage. The genesis of it is to provide this House and the other place with an opportunity, before a scheme and the memorandum of understanding come into force, to question and debate the contents of the scheme. Time and time again the Minister has said that work is going on and that details are being drafted, and he has agreed that the Government have nothing to hide.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00400">We are inviting the Government to reveal all that up to now they have hidden from public view in the confidence that they have it right and also in the confidence that if they are challenged they will be able to carry the argument. To the best of our knowledge constructive discussions are taking place outside this House on the way in which the will of the Government can be carried forward. But, quite frankly, the Government must believe that from time to time even those outside this House and certainly Ministers and their advisers can get it wrong. We are asking that, six weeks before the date on which a scheme comes into force, this House and the other place be given the opportunity to debate the matter and perhaps to allow the Minister and his advisers the opportunity to reflect. So far as we are concerned the present situation means that there will be a <i>fait accompli</i> when the actual scheme has been created. All the Minister has argued is that the procedure we are adopting will provide for an undue delay.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00401">We are talking about the dismantlement of something which has served this country for hundreds of years. The basis of the organisation is being radically altered. I think the Minister would concede that that is what privatisation means. We are talking in terms of taking up some parliamentary time. What are we talking about? Half a day? Even a day? We are talking about some hours of parliamentary time in order that we can be satisfied that the Minister and his advisers have it right. We believe that it is possible for this Government, or any other government, to have their ideas improved upon by debate in this House.</p>
<col>16</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00402">Although discussions are taking place&#x2014;and of course we are not privy to them&#x2014;we have an air of unease that time after time, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> even the last modest amendment proposed, the Government are not prepared to stand by the guns which they deploy in arguments outside this House and allow Members of your Lordships' House and Members of another place to have a look at what they intend to do. The Government are well aware of the parliamentary arithmetic which they can deploy here and in another place. We are simply asking the Minister to take this House into their confidence and treat it with the dignity that we believe ought to be extended to other parliamentarians who are anxious to see what is to happen before it actually takes place. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00403"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there appears to be a typical conflict here between the convenience of the Government and the rights of Parliament. On this issue my noble friends and I know well where we stand. It was a little reassuring to hear in his reply to an earlier amendment the Minister stating that before any privatisation will take place Parliament will be informed. It is the natural and proper course of events to give Parliament the opportunity of expressing its view on privatisation. The Government have to admit that resolute as they have been in resisting amendments throughout the passage of this Bill, they have on one or two occasions taken Parliament's advice, notably in relation to the Ministry of Defence police.<lb/>
I think they regret that they ever drafted the Bill without Schedule 3; but by allowing Parliament the proper time&#x2014;and we cannot complain that we have not had proper time&#x2014;to discuss this Bill the Government themselves were led to make a substantial and important improvement in the Bill. But now they will not allow Parliament to do the same with the scheme. They are going to keep that secret until the last moment, and then they are going to announce it after they have made it.<lb/>
They are going to prevent Parliament playing the same constructive and democratic process that we have seen ourselves playing in the course of this Bill. I would urge the Minister to think carefully about this. As the noble Lord who introduced the amendment said, the ROFs began 500 years ago as a public service. I really think that six weeks might be spared to enable Parliament to consider the Government's scheme, which is very important. There are the whole principles of valuation, the whole question of intellectual property rights, and a lot of people are going to be seriously changed one way or another by the nature of the scheme which the Government will announce. Parliament has the right to discuss this. We warmly support the amendment with its demand that the Government should give us a chance to discuss it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00404"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have addressed the question of the publication of these documents on a number of occasions during the passage of this Bill. I must say again that the Government are quite prepared to lay the first scheme before Parliament by vesting day and to publish any memorandum of understanding no later than vesting day, should it be ready by then, and I hope it will be.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0017"/>
<col>17</col>
The only reservation we have noted is that information may need to be withheld on the grounds of national security or commercial sensitivity.<lb/>
I have already explained that the scheme will deal with the intricate detail of the transfer; examination of the scheme will show exactly which title deeds to land, for example, which leases, which plant, equipment and materials, and which cash and bank balances will transfer to the new company. All of that will be laid out for Parliament to see; but I do not see any argument that there will be any individual item or set of items in the scheme which are of such importance on their own that the Government must hold their hand for six weeks while such minor issues are examined.<lb/>
Parliament has already debated and examined in detail the principles of the transfer, and we are all aware of what is to be transferred in general terms to the new company. The essence of the transfer is that the property currently in the trading fund&#x2014;and accounted for in the annual reports of the ROFs&#x2014;together with the property comprised at the former PERME establishments at Westcott and Waltham Abbey will be vested in the new company. That is what is of interest to the work force and to Parliament; not whether a particular slice of land or a particular machine tool which formed part of the generality of property involved should or should not be transferred.<lb/>
Parliament will of couse be able to examine the propriety of the transfer and to look at the details through its Committee system and otherwise. That will come after the transfer, but it must not be forgotten that we are already asking Parliament for the authority to make the transfer by this Bill currently before your Lordships. The Bill already provides for the publication of the scheme at the appropriate time, when it will have been completed. As I have explained before, to require us to lay the scheme before Parliament six weeks in advance of its coming into force will merely import an unnecessary delay while the new company waits to begin business. I simply cannot see what this amendment hopes to achieve. If Parliament approves the principle of the transfer embodied in this Bill, there is no reason for it to seek to delay the executive action by the Government to give effect to the transfer.<lb/>
As regards the memorandum of understanding, I have said that this is a matter between the Secretary of State as shareholder and the chairman of the company. As shareholder, the Secretary of State will be responsible for the guardianship of public money, but he is of course answerable to Parliament for that function. Parliament is not restricted in making observations or criticisms of the MoU, in the light of which the Secretary of State will be able to amend or supersede that document.<lb/>
I must therefore resist this amendment. The undertakings I have given about publication of the two documents already meet the purpose of part of the amendment, and there is clearly nothing useful to be gained by requiring the Secretary of State to delay vesting day by at least six weeks while these documents lie before Parliament. Parliament will have as much opportunity to question the Government about the
<col>18</col>
details of the scheme after it comes into force as before. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00405"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am disappointed with that reply. The Minister may well have absolute confidence that when Parliament sees the detail of the scheme, or schemes, it will be satisfied. However, he is saying that whether it is satisfied or not, Parliament will then have agreed to the principle of the transference of the assets in one way or the other. If the Minister is also saying that that for which we are asking is not only unusual but even unique, may I say that I am not just talking about the employees or the national interest; I am talking about the interests of parliamentarians. We do not want to clutter up the Order Paper, but we want to see that as often as possible we are kept advised on how this scheme evolves.<lb/>
The Minister will appreciate that although there will be certain modes of procedure carried out here which are common, this is something like a unique situation. Not only the issue of the transfer of the Royal Ordnance factories but what is at stake. What we have asked for time and time again is the opportunity to make a comment. The Minister more than once has said to the House&#x2014;and it was said in another place&#x2014;that discussions are going on and that in the fullness of time all will be revealed. What we say is that as soon as it is possible to reveal it, it should be revealed to us. The Minister is right, we are asking for six weeks' grace. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, said, in the totality of what is at stake, what is six weeks in order to provide Parliament with the satisfaction that what we are suspicious about&#x2014;we are suspicious about some of the details&#x2014;can be assuaged or argued over? The Minister has not been helpful to the House and I shall invite the House to express its views by a vote on the wisdom or otherwise of the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00409">Resolved in the negative, and amendment disagreed to accordingly.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00410">Clause 17 [<i>Finance: general</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00411">3.39 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00412"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member> moved Amendment No. 3:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00413">Page 13, line 39, at end insert&#x2014;
<quote>("(3) This Act shall come into force at the end of the period of six months beginning with the day on which it is passed.")</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00414">The noble Lord said: My Lords, a similar amendment was moved at Report stage to delay implementation of the Bill until 1st October, 1985.
<col>20</col>
This amendment was lost by only 16 votes, indicating that a good number of your Lordships were convinced that the Government were not really ready to proceed with the implementation of the Bill in an orderly manner to the benefit of the taxpayer and with proper safeguards for the careers, conditions of service and prospects of the people concerned at Royal Ordnance factories,</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00415">I do not intend to repeat at length the arguments for delay which I put forward at the Report stage, although all those arguments still apply. I should therefore simply like to emphasise that no answer has yet been given as to the benefit of privatisation, and the employees have yet to be satisfied on a number of serious and important matters. That is a matter of great concern to us as well as to the employees of ROF.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00416">The memorandum of understanding, to which reference has already been made in previous debates, has not been published, and amazingly the noble Lord the Minister was unable at Report stage last week to give any firm date for the publication of this document; although over three months ago the noble Lord assured the House that the memorandum of understanding was almost finished. It was three months ago when the noble Lord the Minister said that the memorandum of understanding was almost finished. We have still not received sight of it. Indeed, the Minister can still only answer us by saying that it will be ready for publication in due course, whatever that may mean.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00417">The Minister said nothing at all about the current order book situation in the ROFs and the possible announcement of large-scale redundancies at a number of factories, a matter which concerns us, and indeed concerns the trade unions and the people employed in ROFs very much indeed. But nothing has been said. Since these redundancies have arisen while the factories are still part of the Ministry of Defence, can we assume that the announcement will be made before vesting day? If the announcement is made before vesting day, it will give absolute confidence to the staff affected that they would be getting MoD levels of redundancy compensation; but, further, for the mobile non-industrial grades affected by potential redundancies it would ensure that they would have the opportunity of transferring to other jobs elsewhere in the Ministry of Defence if suitable vacancies exist. This will take a while to achieve so that this, too, means that there should be a reasonable gap between the enactment of the legislation and vesting day itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00418">Parliament has been given no real details of the financial arrangements&#x2014;a point which has been referred to earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew. He was rightly concerned about it. There have been no details of financial arrangements and the sale value of the new company can apparently only be guessed at. The taxpayers are therefore buying a pig in a poke and overall may find themselves in the end paying private entrepreneurs to take off their hands an undertaking making handsome profits for the Treasury. In other words, the taxpayers may very well be handing over good cash in lieu of profits&#x2014;not in lieu of losses, but in lieu of profits&#x2014;which amounted last year, if my memory is correct, to no less than &#x00A3;62 million for the Treasury. Yet we may be paying private firms and
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0019"/>
<col>21</col>
private entrepreneurs to take these profits off our hands. It is a ridiculous situation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00419">Even those noble Lords who are in sympathy with the general aims of this Bill must agree that the Government approach is sloppy, ill-considered and hasty in the extreme. It is a rush job which can only do harm. I would urge noble Lords on all sides of the House to support this amendment in the interests of efficiency, the taxpayer, the armed forces, the ROFs themselves and all those who work in them. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00420"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will recall that we amended this clause in Committee to take out of the Bill a provision that the Act should come into force two months after Royal Assent. I must say that I find it disappointing that the noble Lord, having accepted that amendment in Committee, now seeks to replace the two-month delay with a six-month delay. The Government's position remains now as it was at Committee stage, and was explained to your Lordships at that time. We are anxious that vesting day should occur as soon as possible after this Bill receives Royal Assent. Obviously it cannot take place before the Act comes into force, and therefore we sought, successfully, to amend the Bill to allow vesting day to take place as soon as the Act is passed. We cannot accept a substitution of a six-month delay for the two-month delay which we have already removed from the Bill.<lb/>
The noble Lord advances as justification for this amendment a suggestion that more time is needed in which to solve certain outstanding problems. I accept that there are still some important matters to be resolved, and we hope that we shall be able to resolve them very shortly. But I must tell the noble Lord, frankly, that there is no legal necessity to resolve them before vesting day, because the legal position of employees is already amply secured by the existing provisions of the Bill. Indeed, it is arguable that many of the outstanding problems may be more easily resolvable after vesting day, when the trade unions are dealing face to face with the new company, than before, when inevitably the Ministry of Defence is involved in the discussions as a kind of intermediary.<lb/>
It has already been necessary to delay vesting day well beyond the period it was hoped it might occur. Both the Government and the company are most anxious that the company should get started in business as soon as possible. Further delay can only work to the disadvantage of everyone concerned, including the employees. Your Lordships will know as well as I do that the inevitable effect of moving a deadline is to dissipate the sense of immediacy attached to having to meet it. There is nothing to suggest that if we amend the clause as proposed we shall be any nearer a solution to outstanding problems in six months' time than we are at present. The disadvantages of this amendment are clear, without there being any apparent advantages. I assure the noble Lord that I share his concern that, if possible, outstanding issues should be resolved before vesting day, and we are doing our utmost to ensure that this is done.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to the question of redundancies. This is a matter which was raised last
<col>22</col>
week at the previous stage of the Bill. I shall have some more to say about that when we come to the next pair of amendments, Nos. 4 and 5, but in the meantime I hope the noble Lord will feel able not to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00421"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder if the noble Lord would reassure the House on one or two points which arose out of his statement. It is quite plain from his statement that a whole mass of work and agreement needs to be done which has not been done. He said that it is just on the verge of being agreed, but I recall that he said that at Committee stage. I am not sure that he did not say it at Second Reading. May we please have from the Minister a clear statement as to what now has been, first of all, agreed with the trade unions&#x2014;pensions, redundancies and other matters&#x2014;and, second, what is the state of play with regard to the memorandum of understanding? Is that finally drafted? Can he please tell us in relation to each of these important matters where the Government have got?<lb/>
We get the impression not simply that the Government are unwilling to postpone&#x2014;maybe they are unwilling to postpone, but they have done it once already; and they will have to postpone because all these other things are in arrears. It sounded to me from what the noble Lord said that the Government might be very wise to accept this amendment, and might be very wise to postpone the operation of the Act until they have got their whole ploy in order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00422"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may have permission to speak again, may I answer the noble Lord in this way? First, the question of when we shall reach agreement on these matters is not wholly in the hands of Government because we are discussing these matters with other people. The noble Lord should address his questions to those other people, for example, the trade unions, who are also involved in the discussion. But, as I said during my earlier remarks, it is not in any event absolutely necessary that all of these matters are precisely agreed before vesting day. I very much hope that they will be and most of them, I believe, will be. I have already assured your Lordships about the sort of documents that we shall be able to make available at that time. But I think that there is an important argument to put before your Lordships, which I have already done; namely, that if we keep moving the deadline nothing will ever be agreed. I hope therefore that the noble Lord will see the force of that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00423"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most disappointed at the Minister's reply. It may very well be his own opinion that it is not necessary for all the matters mentioned by me and by other noble Lords to be resolved by vesting day; but I can assure him that there are many people, including me, who believe that these matters should be resolved before vesting day. I am surprised that the noble Lord should have referred to the fact that there had been already a two-month delay in vesting day. He implied, in fact, that that was a concession to the Opposition, but I would remind him that that two months' delay was at the behest of the Government themselves, and certainly not at the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0020"/>
<col>23</col>
behest of the Opposition. Indeed, when the noble Lord was discussing the original plan for vesting day to be the 1st October 1984, he said, at col. 915 on 16th October:
<quote>"With the benefit of hindsight I think I can say that we would have had some difficulty in meeting that date, anyway".</quote>
Therefore out of his own mouth he confirmed at the Report stage that the original vesting day of 1st October 1984 could not be met. It seems that he has learned nothing since then.<lb/>
What we are saying is that matters which are of great importance have not yet been resolved and that vesting day coming too early may very well put the Government themselves in a bad position. It would certainly be against the best interests of the taxpayers and of those working in the industry. I hope that even now the noble Lord will listen; but there really is no time. I suppose that he cannot get up and say, "I accept this amendment", but unless he is prepared to do so. I shall have no alternative, in all the circumstances and in the light of what he has said in reply, to press it to a Division.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Ethiopia: Famine Relief</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00429">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00430"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your Lordships' permission, I shall now repeat in the form of a Statement an Answer to a Private Notice Question now being given in another place by my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about the situation in Ethiopia. The Answer is as follows:<lb/>
"The Government are extremely concerned at the reports from Ethiopia of the desperate situation there. Although our bilateral dealings with Ethiopia have been modest in recent years, we have, on humanitarian grounds, been providing food aid amounting to nearly 40,000 tonnes in the last two years. My right honourable friend the Minister of State for Overseas Development announced the shipment of 3,000 tonnes of emergency grain supplies earlier this month. The Government have also been exploring with our European Community partners ways in which we can jointly help to alleviate the problems.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0021"/>
<col>25</col>
"One of the greatest difficulties is in the distribution of food once it has arrived in Ethiopia. Britain is currently providing both lorries and spare parts, and we have asked our ambassador in Addis Ababa to make urgent recommendations about further help of this kind which we might provide".<lb/>
My Lords, that is the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00431"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the Minister for repeating that Answer to the Private Notice Question in another place. While I welcome the steps that Her Majesty's Government are taking to help relieve the situation in Ethiopia which the noble Lord has reported, may I ask him whether it is not the case that the drought in Africa, and in particular in Ethiopia, has now reached dimensions well beyond the scope of the usual relief measures, whereas I believe that what the Minister has announced can be characterised as being in the normal way of relief? Is it not a major tragedy that Europe is embarrassed by food mountains and bumper harvests while many thousands are dying in Africa, especially in Ethiopia?<lb/>
Has the Minister seen the estimate by Mr. James Ingram, the Director of the World Food Programme, that nearly 1 million Ethiopians will die unless there is an all-out international effort? Are we not facing a situation where there is not the political will in the international fora to cope with this drastic problem? Do not international efforts, for which Mr. Ingram is calling, have to start with a national objective? Therefore, will the Government take some much bigger initiative than the Minister has announced today&#x2014;an initiative which will in some measure be commensurate with the size of this problem facing us?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00432"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join in thanking the noble Lord for repeating the Statement, and to say that we on these Benches share the general concern about the very serious situation in Ethiopia, which has been described as the most serious situation for 20 years by the United Nations World Food Programme. If the European Community, which has a surplus, could help, and if the Government can promote such help, then we would certainly welcome that. I should like to ask the noble Lord whether he is satisfied that the all-out international effort, to which the noble Lord, Lord Oram, referred, is likely to emerge; and also whether he agrees that, while there is a problem with regard to distribution, there is also a very serious problem with regard to supply, which at the moment has more or less run out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00433"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to both noble Lords, whose observations have underlined the seriousness of this situation, which the Government wholly endorse. I think the question of distribution is an important one. That is why we have taken the steps we have and why, too, we tend to deal with the voluntary agencies already in place in Ethiopia, which, of course, already have some facilities at their disposal for the distribution purposes to which I have referred.<lb/>
So far as the use of the food surpluses within Europe is concerned, this is a matter which is often raised, and, indeed, most of the food aid that has been sent hitherto comes from those surpluses. But it ought to be remembered that that is not the whole solution to the
<col>26</col>
problem, because, for example, large quantities of milk powder are really of no value to the people of Ethiopia or anywhere else if they do not have clean water to mix with the milk powder and, indeed, some elementary instructions on how to do that, both of which, I am sorry to say, are very often lacking. Indeed, milk powder wrongly administered to babies can be very dangerous indeed, and therefore there is a limit to the amount of products of that sort that we can send. Indeed, there are limits to some of the other products as well.<lb/>
But in addition to the items I have mentioned the European Community has been providing some emergency aid worth about &#x00A3;10 million since the beginning of last year, and I understand that some further quantities were agreed in Brussels last week, which will include some of the other less obvious products like vegetable oil and butter oil. The Government are certainly seized of the urgency of the situation but, sadly, the solutions are not quite so easy to see.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00434"><member>Lord Hawke</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has the Minister thought of providing transport facilities in the shape of trucks under lease-lend to Ethiopia, in order to relieve the severe depression which is going on in the truck-building industry in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00435"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have already provided some trucks to Ethiopia for this purpose, but, of course, if we were to go so far as my noble friend suggests that would cost enormous sums of money, and I am not certain that that would be the best use of the resources available.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00436"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as my noble friend and the noble Lord have said, this is a tragedy on a vast scale where at least half a million people are facing starvation. Would the noble Lord not agree that one of the difficulties is that the emergency reserves under the World Food Programme are down to virtually nil? What steps are Her Majesty's Government taking to assist in increasing them, with, for example, our partners in Western Europe? Is he aware, so far as our own surpluses in Western Europe are concerned, that whereas what he said about powdered milk is probably very true, in most parts of the third world they could use flour? It would resolve the situation if the western world could use their surpluses of flour to send to these countries which are now in such dire need, and that is something which Her Majesty's Government should consider as a matter of urgency.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00437"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we certainly have not despaired of doing more in the way of direct food aid, to which the noble Lord has referred. As I said, we are considering with our European Community partners what more can be done. I understand that there are still some resources available within the Community's aid budget for emergency aid, and we shall be doing our best to persuade our partners that they should go where they are most needed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00438"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord did not deal with the question of the World Food Programme.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0022"/>
<col>27</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00439"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware of a number of steps that are being taken within some of the United Nations agencies in this particular matter; for example, the United Nations development programme, which includes UNICEF. I do not have information about the particular programme to which the noble Lord referred. If there is any more information that I can find, I shall write to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00440"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord tell us how far short we are of the 0&#x00B7;7 per cent. target of the United Nations for overseas aid? If we were to reach that target, would it not go some way to assist the problem of lease-lending transport, helping our own industries in this country and relieving the pressure in Ethiopia?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00441"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may say so with respect, that question goes a little wide of the Statement that I have repeated to your Lordships. The fact remains that we are dealing with a particularly special situation in this case, and I do not think we want to be thinking in some high-flying economic terms. What we have to do is to get the food and the distribution arrangements into place in this country just as soon as we can.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Grand Hotel, Brighton: Bomb Explosion</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00442">4.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00443"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a further Statement about the bombing at the Grand Hotel, Brighton, which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary. The statement is as follows:<lb/>
"The House will be well aware of most of the circumstances of the explosion, the purpose of which was no less than to strike a blow at the heart of our democracy by killing the majority of the Cabinet. The gravity of this outrage is reflected in the full-hearted condemnation expressed from all parts of the House and the country at large, as well as from overseas.<lb/>
"I know that the whole House will wish to join me in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families of our late colleague Sir Anthony Berry, Mrs. Jeanne Shattock, Mr. Eric Taylor and Mrs. Roberta Wakeham, who lost their lives. We wish a speedy recovery to the 32 people injured, of whom six are still in hospital. I know that the thoughts of all the House will be with them, including, of course, our colleagues, the right honourable Member for Chingford and the right honourable Member for Colchester South and Maldon. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute here to all those in the emergency services who responded so magnificently, some of them in conditions of great danger, immediately following the explosion.<lb/>
"The Sussex police immediately commenced a full, urgent investigation of this crime and this is proceeding. They are receiving assistance from the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Squad and forensic, technical and computer assistance from the Home Office. I stand ready to provide whatever further resources and help may be required.<lb/>
<col>28</col>
"The task of obtaining evidence about the bomb itself is a formidable one. So far, 31 skips and 750 dustbins full of debris have been removed from the scene. Two hundred and twenty eight police officers are engaged in this operation. High winds and the dangerous state of the hotel structure has made their task more difficult. In addition, more than 200 police officers are engaged in the pursuit of other inquiries. The police are not yet in a position to describe more fully the device itself beyond the fact that it is believed to have comprised about 20 pounds of commercial explosive.<lb/>
"A number of measures have been set in hand since the explosion. The Chief Constable of Sussex decided to ask the Deputy Chief Constable of Hampshire, Mr. Hoddinott, to conduct an inquiry into the security arrangements in place at Brighton at the time of the party conference. I will receive a copy of that report. At this stage, it would be wrong to anticipate its conclusions. I shall, however, to the extent that this does not prejudice security, report them to the House in due course.<lb/>
"With regard to the wider implications for security of the events at Brighton, in the first place immediate attention has been given to the assessment of other potential targets and the provision of proper protection for them. I shall not, of course, give details of the changes that have been made and the measures involved. I can, however, assure the House that after appropriate discussions the House authorities have already set in hand new measures to improve security in the Palace of Westminster.<lb/>
"The Brighton bombing also demonstrates the vulnerability of party political engagements. This applies locally as well as nationally. Local party organisers should be careful to contact the police about arrangements well in advance; and the police service is co-ordinating advice to local forces about how they can best respond. I shall also shortly be in touch with the national party organisations.<lb/>
"In addition, I have set in hand new arrangements centrally for countering the Irish terrorist threat. The aim is to bring to bear the widest range of experience in assessing Irish terrorist intentions and capabilities, and to advise on, and co-ordinate, the counter-measures required to meet them. These measures will supplement the continuing role of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch as the focal point for the collection and evaluation of intelligence and for police operations against Irish Republican terrorists.<lb/>
"Total security is impossible in a free, democratic society. Political and other leaders are vulnerable because they must be accessible. Everything which can be done will be done to prevent such outrages and to protect their targets. But we will not be bombed into boltholes by terrorists. Those who believe that terror can prevail against democracy understand neither the Members of this House nor the British people".<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the text of the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00444"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are most grateful to the noble Lord the Minister of State for repeating the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0023"/>
<col>29</col>
Statement. On 16th October, in terms that were so acceptable to this House when this House alone was sitting, the noble Viscount the Leader of the House made a Statement on this outrage. My noble friend the Leader of the Opposition when speaking for the Opposition, and also in most acceptable terms for the whole House, used these words:
<quote>"In a free society, a criminal attack upon one political party is an attack on all other parties".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report;</i> 16/10/84; col. 885]</quote>
It is in that spirit that we receive the Statement which has been repeated this afternoon.<lb/>
We on these Benches again join in the expressions of deepest sympathy to the families of the four who lost their lives. We are also at one in hoping that the 36 who were injured have a speedy recovery. Especially in our thoughts, as the noble Lord the Minister said when repeating the Statement, are the right honourable Member for Chingford and the right honourable Member for Colchester South and Maldon, whose personal courage meets with the admiration of us all.<lb/>
To turn to other matters, I believe the House will have been interested to hear that the Sussex Police are receiving assistance from the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Squad and forensic, technical and computer assistance from the Home Office. This will be very useful. To go further into the kind of inquiries which are to be made would be, in our judgment, neither suitable nor of aid to anybody but the enemies of our people. Therefore we do not intend to try to probe for details. We have the utmost confidence that the Government will investigate this matter with great ability and with all the expedition that they can.<lb/>
The Statement also dealt very properly, in view of the context in which it was made, with the vulnerability of party political engagements. One noted with sympathy and approval the statement that there will be contact with the national party organisations. I am sure that in the formal or informal contact which is made the senior officers of those organisations will be only too pleased to co-operate in order to ensure that those discussions bear useful fruit.<lb/>
The Statement ended with words which I thought were very appropriate. They were:
<quote>"Those who believe that terror can prevail against democracy understand neither the Members of this House nor the British people".</quote>
That is equally true of the Members of this House, on whatever Benches they may sit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00445"><member>Lord Harris of Greenwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that we on these Benches would wish to be associated in every respect with the Statement made by the Home Secretary in another place? I do not want to add to that Statement because my noble friend Lady Seear dealt with this matter at length last week and it would be pointless for me to go over the same ground&#x2014;except to say that this was a dastardly attack. It was an attack on British democracy and it must be responded to in the most vigorous fashion.<lb/>
Having said that, perhaps I may ask the noble Lord, Lord Elton, one or two questions. I do not want to press him vigorously for obvious reasons, but I will be grateful if he could give some indication of what the Home Secretary meant by his reference to new arrangements which are going to be created centrally
<col>30</col>
to counter the Irish terrorist threat. I only want to press him on this particular point: does that imply that police forces other than the Metropolitan Police are to be associated with these new arrangements? It would be helpful if we could be told that. Secondly, does the noble Lord not accept that the Statement he has repeated today once again emphasises the heavy additional burdens which will inevitably be placed upon the Metropolitan Police, who are responsible in the first instance for dealing with the terrorist threat in these islands?<lb/>
That being so, may I ask him&#x2014;and this is a wider question than that covered by the Statement&#x2014;whether he is not aware of the increasing burdens on the Metropolitan Police in terms of their manpower? Would he and his right honourable friend not be prepared to consider at some stage&#x2014;but not, I hope, in the too distant future&#x2014;the question of the establishment of the Metropolitan Police, which many of us feel does not recognise the heavy additional burdens which are now being placed upon that force?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00446"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the reception given to my right honourable friend's Statement so far in this House has revealed absolute unanimity on a number of points; an attack on one is an attack on all, and an attack on all is an attack on democracy and will be repulsed.<lb/>
I welcome the support which noble Lords have given. As to the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, concerning both the role of and the burden carried by the Metropolitan Police, the role of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch under the new arrangements will be substantially unchanged. The objective of the new arrangements is to provide readier access between them and the various departments and agencies concerned, to discuss and interpret information available in relation to other information&#x2014;including political developments&#x2014;which could have a bearing on the security situation.<lb/>
The question of the establishment of the Metropolitan Police for purposes other than those under discussion now is another matter but I am sure that the noble Lord's views will not go unnoticed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00447"><member>The Lord Bishop of Chichester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I add a few words from these Benches? The Bishop of Rochester was able to express some of our feelings last week, when I myself was unable to be here. Brighton is in my diocese and I was privileged to be able to share in the service held yesterday morning, and in the afternoon to visit in hospital the two Members of the other House who have been mentioned. I should like to add my tribute to their bravery and courage in facing not only their own physical condition but also the great anxieties which they naturally have about their families.<lb/>
I would like to pay tribute also to the Sussex Police and particularly to the chief constable, because I believe that they have been placed in a very difficult position and subjected to some unfair criticism. We should realise that the chief constable had to provide the policing of two major conferences within a matter of a very few weeks&#x2014;each or which might be likely to cause a good deal of controversy and certainly demonstrations of one kind or another. A great strain

<col>31</col>
was placed on his force, and then to have this disaster occur at the very end of it all is something which should call out our sympathy for the chief constable as well as for many others, of course. I know from what the chief constable said to me yesterday that he is very anxious that the whole matter of security should receive the most thorough investigation.<lb/>
I should like to repeat something that I said yesterday morning in church, and recall again that the terrorists could not have the success which they do were they not supported and sheltered by very large numbers of ordinary people who, we may think misguidedly, have nevertheless been brought up with a certain view of history and of culture and who believe that they are ministering to that view. It will take a very long time to break through that, but we must work away at doing so. As we know, there are groups in Northern Ireland&#x2014;the Corrymeela community and others&#x2014;who are trying to build bridges, and I hope that we can give them renewed support as a reult of this terrible and outrageous thing that has happened so close to us here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00448"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the right reverend Prelate has added the praise of the Church to the praise of the state for the emergency services, and we are grateful to him for that. I am equally grateful to him for his kind words about the Sussex Police, who have been subjected to one or two unfounded criticisms. I would like to dispel the idea that there is bad feeling between them and the Metropolitan Police, because there is not; there is perfect co-operation, and that is borne out by both parties. We welcome as always&#x2014;and, I suspect, could not get far without&#x2014;the prayers of the Church in the resolution of our problems, and the gesture of the churches on Sunday was a heartening gesture of unanimity of all the faiths in pursuit of the defence of democracy and of life.<lb/>
The right reverend Prelate rightly said that those who give shelter to these assassins do a more evil thing than they realise. There is much yet to be done in explaining to people the extent of that evil and the extent to which it is being combated&#x2014;not only by the methods available to the state but also by the reconciliatory offices of others in the country where it really matters.<lb/>
I return to the substance of the Statement. It was a terrible deed. Your Lordships stand against it four square and together; and I am grateful to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Miners' Strike</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00449">4.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00450"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (The Earl of Avon)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to repeat a Statement which is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy on the coal dispute. The Statement reads as follows:<lb/>
"With permission, Mr. Speaker, I will make a Statement about developments in the coal dispute during the Recess.<lb/>
<col>32</col>
"Between 9th September and 14th September the NCB held negotiations with the NUM in an attempt to reach agreement that would settle this dispute.<lb/>
"During these negotiations the National Union of Mineworkers refused any formula which would have permitted any pit closures on any economic grounds.<lb/>
"In September the pit deputies' union, NACODS, decided to ballot their members on three questions. But their members were not asked to give their approval or disapproval on these questions separately but were asked to give their approval or disapproval on all three together with a single, 'Yes' or 'No'.<lb/>
"Since the ballot the Coal Board have resolved with NACODS two of the issues which had led the union to hold a strike ballot of its members. The third issue, dealing with the reduction in the industry's capacity, resulted in NACODS requesting the National Coal Board to hold meetings with the National Union of Mineworkers under the auspices of the Advisory and Conciliation Service. These talks took place between 11th and 15th October.<lb/>
"At the start of these talks it was agreed that ACAS would distill the NUM's position and circulate it to the other parties. After the NCB had commented, ACAS, having heard the views of all the parties, undertook to put foward its own text. As the chairman of ACAS, Mr. Lowry, has confirmed, this was the only paper carrying the title of 'ACAS Proposal'. The NCB accepted this ACAS compromise proposal, but the NUM rejected it&#x2014;circulating instead a further text of their own.<lb/>
"Subsequent to the talks, Mr. Scargill confirmed publicly that on the key position of pit closures he had not moved his position since the dispute started in March.<lb/>
"The Government regret the failure to accept the ACAS compromise proposal, which would have enabled the damage being done to the coal industry to cease and the widespread violence that has occurred throughout this dispute to come to an end.<lb/>
"Over 70,000 men were at work in the mining industry last week, a third of the industry. Most of these men had the chance of a ballot as required by normal NUM procedures. They had decided to work.<lb/>
"There are substantial stocks of coal at the power stations and I am pleased to inform the House that power station stocks at the end of last week were higher than they were at the end of August. The Government will continue to take all actions which are necessary to protect the life of the nation and to preserve jobs.<lb/>
"Following the negotiations that have taken place throughout the summer I wish to remind the House of the package that is now on offer to the miners: A wage increase from last November providing earnings way above average industrial earnings and greater than that gained by many groups of workers: An undertaking that any miner who wishes to continue working in the industry will be able to do so: Exceptionally generous provisions for those who choose a course of early retirement when a pit needs
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0025"/>
<col>33</col>
to close: A capital investment programme more than double that of the rest of the European Community put together, a programme to secure an industry capable of obtaining expanding markets in the future: An amended colliery review procedure which includes all the provisions that have operated under Labour and Conservative Governments for many years past but adds to it provision for an independent review body, whose advice will be given full weight before any decision is made: The creation of the new enterprise company whereby for the first time the Coal Board will be active in financing, advising and providing accommodation to new enterprises and businesses to benefit the mining communities.<lb/>
"In order that there should be no doubt on the Benches opposite, I repeat that the board not only remains committed to the operation of the colliery review procedure, but is prepared to enhance that procedure. Furthermore, any pit proposed for closure by the board can be examined through the amended procedure.<lb/>
"This is a package of proposals which is good for the miner, good for the mining industry and I am confident would be accepted by miners had they the opportunity of a ballot on these issues.<lb/>
"Strife and industrial action can only intensify the damage being done to pits and to markets for coal and therefore to the future of the miner and his family. I hope, therefore, that the miners' union can be persuaded of the good sense of accepting the proposals made by ACAS earlier this month."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00451"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Earl for repeating the Statement made in another place, but I have to say that, so far as we are concerned, the Statement is a recitation of events which have taken place and which have been widely reported in the newspapers and the rest of the media, and there seems to be nothing new at all.<lb/>
Does the noble Earl not agree that in the opening paragraphs of the Statement all the blame is a bit one-sided? In fact, all the blame for the present problems is put firmly on the shoulders of the NUM. Does he not agree that under all the circumstances that is rather unfair? Is it not a fact that Mr. MacGregor and the National Coal Board were also being intransigent at that point in time in issuing, or at least appearing to issue, a hit list of coal mines that were to be closed, quite outside the procedures which were agreed in 1973 and 1975 wherein all proposed pit closures went through a proper procedure and there was no list? Therefore, is it not true that this argument is not quite as one-sided as the Minister made out and that there are certainly faults on the part of the NCB?<lb/>
Coming to the NACODS dispute, does the noble Earl also not agree that it was sheer incompetence for the NCB to seek to alter arrangements in the middle of the miners' dispute in such a way as so to anger the NACODS members as to lead them to vote by a majority of over 80 per cent. to strike? What are we to hear about ballots under those circumstances? That was overwhelming enough. Indeed, the ballot itself was brought about by the intransigence of the NCB
<col>34</col>
and its failure to understand that it was dealing with an extremely able, dedicated and responsible body of people who, to my knowledge, have never before been on strike. Was that not sheer incompetence? What do the Government intend to do about that situation?<lb/>
On the question of ACAS, is it not true that there were three proposals&#x2014;one which was acceptable to the NCB, one to the NUM, and another which was acceptable to the NCB only? We have been given only one side of the argument. The general president of the National Union of Mineworkers has put forward another view of what happened at ACAS. It seems to me that we need more clarification as to exactly what went on there.<lb/>
The noble Earl said that there are substantial stocks of coal at the power stations and that he was pleased to inform the House that power station stocks at the end of last week were higher than they were at the end of August and that the Government will continue to take all actions which are necessary to see that the power stations continue to provide the energy necessary to protect the life of the nation and to preserve jobs. May I first ask the noble Earl to state what is the level of coal stocks at present? Just exactly what is that level? Will he also inform the House, because we are entitled to know, just exactly how the Government intend to keep the power stations going if the NACODS men go out on strike and all coal production ceases in this country? Having a certain amount of knowledge of the electricity supply industry, I take the view that if the coal industry comes to a standstill, there will be only six weeks' stocks of coal in the power stations. That means that there will be power cuts by the beginning of December; that is, unless the Government are prepared to take action to move coal stocks on the ground outside the power stations. Will the noble Earl say whether the Government are contemplating that possibility and, if so, what that will do to the political and social life of our country?<lb/>
I am coming to a close, but this is an important matter and we need answers. With regard to the pit closures themselves&#x2014;and we really must move forward&#x2014;I must say to noble Lords that we are in a most terrible crisis; we must make no mistake about that. The strike has now been going on for nearly eight months. Our coal stocks are run right down. As regard the pits for closure, would it not be right for the NCB to say that in the light of all the circumstances of having no coal production and virtually no coal stocks, or very low coal stocks, there will be no pit closures until those stocks have been built up; in other words, that all proposals are suspended for the time being and for a considerable period forward? Is that not a way forward?<lb/>
There is no doubt that it is necessary to bring this strike to a speedy end. We concur with the Government on that. That is why we have been imploring them over a long period of time to accept their responsibilities and to intervene in this dispute. I urge them now to accept those responsibilities and to build on what has already been achieved&#x2014;and there have been some achievements&#x2014;to ensure that the two sides are brought together, that realistic negotiations take place, and that the strike is brought to a speedy

conclusion to the benefit of the miners, the miners' families, and the nation as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00452">4.41 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00453"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to join the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, in thanking the noble Earl for repeating the Statement made in another place. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, made clear, the Statement simply summarises what occurred in the mining industry during the recess. What it does not do is indicate what other steps the Government may now have in mind to try to accelerate the conclusion of this unfortunate dispute. It would be useful to hear from the noble Earl what thoughts the Government have in that connection, however difficult it may be.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, referred to the added misfortune of the troubles with NACODS. This came right out of the blue. Apparently steps have now been taken to try to satisfy them and prevent them from taking the ultimate step of joining the strike. Let us hope that they will be deterred from doing that.<lb/>
We on this side of the House welcome the recently announced appointment of Mr. Michael Eaton, the area director of North Yorkshire. I can say from my personal knowledge of Mr. Eaton over many years that he is a very experienced man in the mining industry and he handles his union relations with extreme skill, in difficult situations. I should like to ask for an assurance that in his present post he will be given every encouragement to use his undoubted ability to advantage.<lb/>
There has been a lot of talk of winners and losers in this dispute. I should like to put it to the noble Earl that there will be no winners. There will, unfortunately, be one loser, and that will, alas, be the coal industry. The coal industry will lose due to the bitterness which has grown up among personal relationships during the course of the strike and because of the damage which is increasingly being done on a number of faces. That is all the more reason why the dispute should be brought to an end quickly.<lb/>
In conclusion, what we on this side of the House should like to hear from the Minister is what further initiatives the Government have in mind. For example, the Secretary of State for Energy has repeatedly made known in public statements the positive measures which the Government have in mind for the future of the coal industry. Would it not be helpful if he were now to convene a meeting of the tripartite committee&#x2014;a procedure which has existed since 1974&#x2014;and tell the parties concerned in detail what the Government have in mind? Would this not be regarded as a step towards resolving this longstanding dispute?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00454"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for their reception of the Statement as a <i>r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;</i> of what has been going on during the recess. I would just say to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that that is what the Statement was meant to be, and I do not believe it should be criticised for it.<lb/>
A number of questions were raised. With regard to the idea of all the blame being on one side, I think one
<col>36</col>
should look at the last decade, when the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, had much to do with the coal industry, and say that both the Labour Party and this party have agreed on how the coal industry should be carried on. We have agreed that the Plan for Coal should be pursued. The party which is not doing this is the National Union of Mineworkers. Therefore it is not surprising that all the blame may seem to be on its shoulders.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, mentioned a hit list. There is no hit list of pits to be closed. Now under the ACAS proposals all the pits which have been talked about can come up with this added safeguard in the review procedure.<lb/>
The noble Lord mentioned the NACODS ballot paper. The ballot paper asks three questions and has only one place for "Yes" and "No". Therefore, presumably, unless one would answer the same way to all three questions it would be a difficult ballot to fill in. I should also add that Question No. 3, the dominant question at the bottom of the paper, just before the "Yes" refers to the complete rejection of the board's guidelines in terms of 15th August. The board has already withdrawn these guidelines; so there is no point there. Question No. 2 refers to the board's attitude to the implementation of concilliation procedures. As we know, ACAS has put forward a formula to which the Coal Board agrees.<lb/>
I think that in paragraph 5 of the Statement it is made extremely clear that there was only one paper put forward by ACAS. This has been supported by the chairman of ACAS, Mr. Lowry. This is the paper which the NCB were prepared to accept and which contained the review procedure.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked about stocks. I can assure him that there are adequate stocks at power stations. The amount on 29th July was 15.93 million tonnes; at NCB sites it was 22.17 million tonnes. As I told the noble Lord, there has been virtually no change in this figure in the intervening period.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, in some helpful remarks, mentioned Mr. Michael Eaton. I should like to add to what the noble Lord said, and to say that we wish Mr. Eaton well. This is an appointment by Mr. MacGregor. It is an internal appointment, and we believe that it is an initiative which should go well.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked about Government policies and was kind enough to say that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy has put forward his initiative and spelled it out in clear terms. I believe that that is the Government's problem. I should like to say also that my right honourable friend is open to any talks&#x2014;tripartite or any other form. There is no closed door here.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00455"><member>Lord Taylor of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while joining the other speakers in welcoming the Statement repeated by the noble Earl, may I say, first of all, that I do not think that it is as up-to-date as it might be and as I personally expected it to be. There was no mention at all, as far as I can recall, of the changed situation in the industry in regard to public relations.<lb/>
May I now ask the noble Earl this. Is the recent appointment of this gentleman from Yorkshire, whose name eludes me for the moment&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0027"/>
<col>37</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00456"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Mr. Eaton.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00457"><member>Lord Taylor of Mansfield</member><membercontribution>: Everybody in the country knows, through the press this morning and the rest of the media, that there has been something of a change so far as the operations of the NCB are concerned. I am not clear about this point from the information contained in the press and the rest of the media. The question that I should like to ask is this. First of all, with regard to this new appointment, will the Minister tell us whether this gentleman is or is not a member of the board?<lb/>
Secondly, will the Minister inform your Lordships whether this gentleman is to take part in any negotiations that might&#x2014;and we all hope very shortly will&#x2014;take place with a view to a speedy ending of this tragic dispute, or is this newly appointed gentleman merely a personal assistant to Mr. MacGregor, the existing chairman of the Coal Board, or is he just a public relations officer?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00458"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I actually mentioned Mr. Eaton in my reply to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, who is not in alliance with the Scargill-McGahey axis would deny. Instead the Government have left it to the Coal Board by Mr. MacGregor himself. I gather that he has until recently been the regional representative in Yorkshire and he has come down to strengthen the London team. He is not at the moment a member of the board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00459"><member>Lord Wilson of Langside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl the Minister aware that there is quite a widespread, and I think well-founded, feeling in the country, which is this? In the role which the Government have adopted throughout this dispute and in the contribution&#x2014;or lack of it&#x2014;which they have made to its solution, they have failed the nation. This lies in the fact that their sole overt contribution&#x2014;and I stress the word "overt"&#x2014;has been repeated Ministerial rhetorical denunciations of violence at the picket lines, which no sensible person who is not in alliance with the Scargill-McGahey axis would deny. Instead the Government have left it to the police, who do not want the problem, and to Mr. MacGregor, whose talents appear to lie in other directions, to slog it out from week to week and month to month with the National Union of Mineworkers, dominated by Scargill and McGahey.<lb/>
Do the Government not appreciate that what is needed in an essentially political situation is a positive, political initiative? Are the Government further aware that there is a strong feeling, particularly on these Benches, that what is, in all essentials, I think it is agreed on all sides, a political dispute, should have been discussed in Parliament by both Houses where it properly belongs? Speaking solely for myself, I feel that the Government's attitude towards Parliament in this dispute in refusing to recall it in time is somewhat contemptuous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00460"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I really cannot accept most of what the noble and learned Lord said. So far as I am concerned, there has been no lack of discussion. I do not believe that in any way the Government have failed the nation. I believe, quite to
<col>38</col>
the contrary, that they have followed a path of considerable understanding. This is not a simple dispute. I would remind the noble Lord that there are 70,000 people in the mining industry working at the moment, that this is a dispute called without a ballot, and, finally, as I said earlier, that the NUM has not moved one inch in any negotiations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00461"><member>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend if he would not agree that to call for public political initiatives is quite easy; to define them is rather harder? I should like to ask if he would not agree that initiatives that consist of compromising the position on the closure of pits that have become uneconomic and initiatives that give some kind of covert approval to violence of an intolerable kind would not be very valuable or useful contributions in the long run?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00462"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is indeed right to underline the difficulties of this particular position.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00463"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Earl to clarify one important part of the Statement which says that the board not only remains committed to the operation of the colliery review procedure but is prepared to enhance that procedure. Would the noble Earl say exactly what that means? Is it the case that both the NCB and the NUM were prepared to accept the independent recommendation of a body set up to conduct that procedure? Will he confirm indeed that the Government have in mind to set up a body that would be independent and that would look at any recommendations for pit closures? Is the NCB in particular prepared to accept the recommendation of an independent body to that effect? Secondly, will the noble Earl answer the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, about the possibility of the Government's convening the tripartite committee, which seems to me a very sensible proposal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00464"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that I followed the noble Lord's question. It might be easier if I read out the sentence from the ACAS proposal and took it from there:
<quote>"The colliery review procedure would be amended to include as a final stage an independent review body whose function would be to consider a reference from any one of the parties to the procedure on any closure matter arising under Clauses A, B and C above about which there is a disagreement".</quote>
This has been accepted by the NCB, but unfortunately not by the NUM which put forward another paper after this. This is the quotation from the ACAS proposals. The Government, as well as the NCB, will stand by it. As to the tripartite agreement, I did say to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, that the door was open in this sphere.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00465"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00466"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: No, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00467"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: Oh yes, yes. Briefly, there are a couple of points that arise out of the answer that the Minister has given. Would he not agree that the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0028"/>
<col>39</col>
whole question of the NACODS dispute does not arise from what was on the ballot paper but that it was the board's stupid actions that caused a ballot to be called? Had the board been properly managing the industry, does he not agree that there would have been no ballot among NACODS members and that we should not have had the present problems?<lb/>
Secondly, the Minister confirms my own estimate of power station stocks at 15&#x00B7;93 million tonnes. He also mentioned 22 million tonnes at CEGB sites. Would he not agree that that coal is not immediately available at power stations for burning and has to be transported? Would he agree that? If he does agree, how does he think that it is going to be transported under present conditions? Would he confirm that, if I am right that that coal cannot be transported and that there are only 15&#x00B7;93 million tonnes of coal at power stations, there are only between six and seven weeks' stocks of coal left? Would he confirm that? Finally, can I ask him whether Mr. Eaton's appointment does not mean and confirm that Mr. MacGregor's appointment was, first of all, provocative and was in fact putting the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00468"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer to the first supplementary question is a categorical, No. In answer to the second, the noble Lord does seem to be a harbinger of doom on this particular subject&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00469"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: No; I just want information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00470"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: I have told him the amount at the power stations. He has tried to turn my figures around and push them back again. As someone who knows all about power stations, I am not prepared to argue with him across the Floor of the House but to rest on the figures I gave him initially.<lb/>
So far as Mr. Eaton's appointment is concerned, I have bent over backwards to show that this is an internal appointment of the National Coal Board. I should like to say of Mr. MacGregor that already in his term of office&#x2014;before the strike happened&#x2014;he has done a great deal for the coal industry. He offered guarantees; he set up an enterprise board. He was even having success in overseas markets. I wish that the coal industry could get back to a working condition so that he can continue.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00478">It is right that there should be one debate. I know, however, that the Minister will understand that both deal with very vital elements in the issue of redundancy.

In other words, I am really signalling to the Minister that it is what he says at the Dispatch Box today that will be most important. What he had to say in this place last Wednesday was taken by the trade unionists when they met the ROF management the next day as the way in which matters should proceed. I have to inform the Minister, however, that what the Minister says here is not necessarily taken by ROF management as gospel and an indication of how matters will proceed. These are not allegations. But the situation is very serious.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00479">In effect, the Minister and his advisers, the civil servants who are negotiating with the trade unions, are coming to what might be seen to be a constructive outcome over very difficult propositions. Yet, when these are taken forward so that the nitty-gritty can be agreed with ROF management, I have to tell the Minister that I am advised that a totally different view is taken by ROF management from what the Minister believes will be the position before and after vesting day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00480">For the benefit of the record, let me go through this very slowly. A meeting was held on Thursday, 18th October; that was only two days after the Minister made certain statements. I have the record here and I will quote from it. At that meeting between the unions and ROF management the unions were seeking to clarify the attitude of management to changes in the agreements which currently exist for civil servants employed in the ROFs, in the light of the statements made by the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, on TUPE '81 and other related matters during the Report stage debate on 16th October.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00481">The unions were quoting to ROF management the statements made by the Minister, for example at col. 937 of <i>Hansard</i>, where the Minister said:
<quote>"Of course. TUPE applies to the transfer of employment. The effect of this is that there need be no new contract of employment because the old one continues without a break from the former employer to the new employer. The terms and conditions of the contract of employment with the new employer are therefore identical to those of the contract with the old employer, because it is exactly the same contract".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00482">Those are the words of the Minister.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0029"/>
<col>41</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00483">Further on, in the same column, the Minister said:
<quote>"First, there may have to be some minor differences in the terms and conditions following transfer, because the transfer is from employment under the Crown. Some aspects of such employment are simply not applicable to employment in the private sector. Subparagraph (2) of paragraph (2) of the second schedule to the Bill deals with this point, and requires, in effect, that these changes be kept to the absolute minimun"&#x2014;</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00484">I stress, to the absolute minimum&#x2014;
<quote>"necessary to make the transfer of employment effective".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00485">This seemed a very clear statement to the unions that under the terms of the eventual Act, on the transfer of civil servants to the new company any changes to the current conditions of employment proposed by ROF management would legally have to be kept to a minimum. However, the ROF management stated at the meeting on 18th October that they had taken advice and that they did not necessarily agree with what the Minster was saying. Management had taken independent advice and were not necessarily agreeing with what the Minister was saying. Managment argued that since the new company would be in such a different situation to that of MoD, then TUPE '81 did not necessarily cover them at all and they could make any changes to the terms and conditions of service for transferred staff immediately after vesting day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00486">This is a very serious state of affairs. The Minister, I believe in absolutely good faith, guided by his civil servants, who have always been very fair in these matters, is telling the unions, and certainly telling the House and myself and my noble friends, that there is not a great deal to worry about because there will be carried forward after vesting day as far as possible and kept to the minimum any changes in the kind of situations which existed before. What we need from the Minister is not acceptance of the amendments; the amendments in fact are pegs upon which we want restatements of what he has said already. In col. 940 of <i>Hansard</i>, during the same debate, the Minister said:
<quote>"if changes to the contract of employment are to be made in respect of employees (whether they be industrial or non-industrial) after vesting day, then that will be a matter for agreement between the trade unions and the company. In my view, the trade unions are fully protected against the anxieties which they have expressed because if they feel aggrieved, they will have the remedy of the procedures to which I have already referred".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00487">By this, the Minister was referring to the right to take legal action against the company. Obviously the unions want to avoid that possibility and want to understand precisely what the Bill means at Schedule 2. Yet the company management are saying that TUPE '81 need not necessarily apply after vesting day. We need to get the Minister to confirm his statements at the Report stage on 16th October. Quite simply, I am asking the Minister if he will say, "Yes, yes", or repeat the statements. I am asking him to confirm the two extracts that I read out, from cols. 937 and 940, as the definitive interpretation by the Minister. Are they correct?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00488">What the unions have been attempting to do in the negotiations with ROF management is to clarify and sort out what changes in the current terms and conditions will have to be made, accepting that certain things cannot be transferred from service in the Crown to a Companies Act company. The unions have been doing this in the light of Schedule 2, paragraph 2(2),
<col>42</col>
which states that the changes will be kept to a minimum. Yet ROF management seem now to be arguing that they can make any changes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00489">Initially, even though a Companies Act company, the ROF organisation will be working on really very similar lines to those under which it has been operating as a Government trading fund. It will be liable to the Government competition policy just as the ROFs are now. It will have lost the preferred source policy just as the ROFs have already lost that. It will be working to commercial accounting practices just as the ROFs have been as a trading fund. Until such time as private capital is introduced into the new company the shares will be wholly owned by the Government just as the Government are the sole owner of the ROF organisation. The unions therefore do not understand how the ROF management can argue that the new company's situation is so drastically altered from the current position of the ROFs as to make TUPE '81 not apply. We need from the Minister the categorical assurance that he gave at the Report stage that the guarantees, in so far as they are interpretable, can be given.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00490">The unions have been seeking to make in a constructive way such changes as need to be made. Quite frankly, we are greatly puzzled that it is possible for the management, who of course are civil servants, to interpret or to dismiss the words of a Minister in this House as not being the words that will bind them when the discussions take place. In Amendment No. 5 we have other aspects of what we are concerned about. The Minister knows that the actual vesting day is crucial to the protection of the employees. My noble friend Lord Stoddart, in an earlier debate, sought to create a kind of cushion after vesting day and before the schemes could be brought in. One of the reasons for that is that for those who are made redundant such a cushion will provide the Civil Service with the opportunity of replacing them before the actual vesting day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00491">In regard to the possibility of redundancies being announced, the Minister knows of the intelligence that we have been given and I will not belabour the point any more. We have been given intelligence about the likelihood of announcements about impending redundancies. It is absolutely crucial that the Minister is able either to make the statements or to give those who can be affected by redundancy the assurance that, whether the redundancies are announced before or after vesting day, the people concerned will enjoy the same kind of protection. We ought not to have the views of this House or of the Minister on these matters negatived by ROF management. I hope that the Minister will say that he stands by the statement he made at Report stage. If he does that, I shall be very pleased to withdraw the amendments. But at this stage I beg to move Amendment No. 4.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00492"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have explained during earlier stages of this Bill, the Government believe that TUPE '81 provides for the transfer of the existing terms and conditions of employment to the new company, save for the small changes necessary having regard to the fact that the employees will be transferring from employment under the Crown to employment under the new Companies Act company.
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0030"/>
<col>43</col>
In regard to the redundancy terms the Government firmly believe that this means that the terms and conditions immediately after vesting day will include provision for company-wide, mobile, non-industrial arrangements rather than anything confined to a single works. Of course, it will be open to the new company to seek to negotiate with the workforce changes in the terms and conditions of employment which will apply after vesting day. But the workforce representatives will not be obliged to accept any such changes, and if the management persists in imposing them then the time-honoured remedies will be available to the unions, as they have always been.<lb/>
I believe, therefore, that I can confirm everything that I said on Report; but, of course, I have to point out that in the end the question of whether TUPE 81 does or does not apply is a matter for the courts. But the Government's view is contained in the words that I have already uttered, which I hope will be of assistance to the noble Lord. That, I think, disposes of the question raised by the noble Lord in connection with Amendment No. 4.<lb/>
I turn to Amendment No. 5. Of this particular matter the Government are aware, and, indeed, the noble Lord mentioned in his speech, that this point has been raised by the trades unions. While I would certainly not wish to tie the hands of the new management in this or in any other way, I will certainly ask the company to consider whether they can give the assurance which has been sought. However, having said that, I must emphasise that the responsibility for this matter will pass on vesting day to the new company. If the workforce are aggrieved by what the company intends, they will be able to press their views by action under the employment protection legislation, as I believe I mentioned earlier, or by more traditional methods.<lb/>
I have attempted to express the thoughts that I had to utter in the plainest and most unequivocal terms. I hope that they have met the anxieties expressed by the noble Lord and that he will feel able to withdraw Amendment No. 4 and not press Amendment No. 5.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00493"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for the robust defence that he has put up of the words that he used. I accept completely that after vesting day we are in a new ball game. That worries us. Prior to vesting day the Minister is wholly in charge. For instance, he is wholly in charge at this moment of what ROF management is saying now. If prior to vesting day&#x2014;that is, at this moment&#x2014;the management of the ROFs are saying (and one hears this second and third hand) that they have heard what the Minister has said but they do not intend to operate in that way, then it is a very serious state of affairs. It does not give the trade unions much confidence. Although the Minister, in good faith, and his civil servants and advisers, have been most constructive with the unions in trying to get together a package which will get us through the next period, the unions do not have much confidence that, once they are thrown to the wolves, the words of the Minister, unless they are embodied in an Act of Parliament, will offer a great deal of protection.<lb/>
<col>44</col>
More than once on Report the Minister, in our view, gave the type of assurances which the trade unions were satisfied to accept and which provided them with a basis for taking the matter forward. In attempting to take it forward they have had a rude shock from ROF management. However, in view of the fact that the Minister&#x2014;and I would be grateful if he would nod his head in agreement&#x2014;is simply confirming what he said at the Report stage on those two vital matters (and let the record show that the Minister does nod his head) that is as much as the Minister can do at this stage. I very much hope that he and his advisers will seek urgently to convey to ROF management what he considers&#x2014;and I believe it is something of a minor outrage&#x2014;is being perpetrated in the discussions.<lb/>
There are other stages of this Bill, not least in another place. I am sure that my parliamentary colleagues will be kept fully advised of the matter until it goes down there and comes back up here. The matter is far from concluded, but at this stage I beg leave to withdraw Amendment No. 4, and I advise your Lordships that I shall not be moving Amendment No. 5.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00500">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 6, which stands in my own name and that of my noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton. We had long discussions on this matter at the Report stage on Amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21. I can assure the noble Lord the Minister that I do not intend today to make a further 22-minute speech, although I have to say that the issue is of such vital importance that it should not be simply brushed aside.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00501">Our contention is that the mere change of status of the ROFs in no way reduces the need for security of at least as high an order as before. Indeed, the very change of status itself may very well enhance the need for top-rate security as is provided by the Ministry of Defence police under Government control. I would remind the House that the Government's original intention was that the Royal Ordnance factories should, when privatised, be guarded by, and have security provided by, private contract security guards. Fortunately, through pressure in Parliament and elsewhere, at a very late stage indeed in the Commons the Government discovered the error of their ways and introduced Schedule 3, which empowers the Secretary of State to retain the Ministry of Defence police at such ROF sites as he thinks fit, complete with their full police powers, including the ability to bear arms. That, of course, was progress, and we welcomed the Government's change of mind. But it simply does not
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0031"/>
<col>45</col>
go far enough for us, because we believe that the MoD police should continue to guard all ROF establishments in perpetuity, or at least until the matter has been brought before Parliament again after some years of privatisation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00502">The noble Lord the Minister, in replying to the debate at the Report stage on 16th October, said at column 962:
<quote>"We have been at pains to point out that the degree of threat varies from site to site within the ROFs. Some factories contain materials which may be of great use to terrorists but others&#x2014;for example, those making tanks&#x2014;do not constitute a serious terrorist target".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00503">The example that the Minister gave&#x2014;that is, factories making tanks&#x2014;worries me a great deal, Is he really suggesting that a tank could not be a legitimate terrorist target? A tank in the wrong hands could cause all sorts of havoc. We have seen in recent months and weeks what damage and carnage can be caused by a lorry-load of explosives driven by a terrorist into an army base and an embassy. A tank driven by fanatics&#x2014;and certainly we have them in this country&#x2014;could inevitably cause greater havoc and carnage. I was surprised indeed that the Minister gave that example. In fact, it undermines the confidence that we have in the judgment of the noble Lord the Minister and of the Government in these matters. We like the noble Minister a lot&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00504"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: Steady on!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00505"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: On an entirely personal basis, my Lords, but the fact of the matter is that he did not reassure us on this issue at Report. Indeed, bearing in mind the attempt to assassinate Her Majesty's Government at Brighton on 12th October and the boast of the vile men of the IRA that they intended to step up their terrorist attacks on mainland Britain, I was surprised that he appeared to show such complacency&#x2014;I am sure that he did not mean it, but he showed it&#x2014;about security at armament factories. The fact is that far from lowering our security profile, we need to heighten it. We should not only keep up our guard; we should reinforce our guard in the face of a growing and more violent terrorist threat. Therefore, the Labour Party believes that the Ministry of Defence Police, who have proved themselves over long years to be an efficient, well-trained, responsible and dedicated force, should continue to be responsible for security at all ROF establishments after privatisation. Nothing else will really do. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00506"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the course of the Bill the Government have made some concessions to the pressure of the Opposition, my noble friends and my honourable friends in another place, and have come some way to meet us on this security issue. It is a little difficult now to define exactly the difference between the position of the Government and the position which some of us on this side of the House should like to see adopted.<lb/>
As I understand it, the way is still open under Schedule 3 for those who are special constables to be, simply in another name, factory guards responsible to the private company concerned. I believe that that is still possible under the terms of Schedule 3. But my noble friends and I would want the policing ultimately
<col>46</col>
to be a matter for the Government, as it is now. As happens now, the Ministry of Defence Police are answerable to the Chief Constable of Defence Police and through the Defence Council to the Secretary of State for Defence. I think that that is better. It seems to me to be carrying privatisation a very long way if we try to privatise security against terrorism. In practice, so far as I can see this would be the effect of Schedule 3.<lb/>
I shall not go over all the arguments that we have heard on many previous occasions on the Bill, but I should be grateful if the Minister would answer the precise point that I am making: whether, in fact, Schedule 3 permits the policing of these factories ultimately to be the responsibility of a private company, or whether a police force is still responsible which is ultimately answerable to the Government of the day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00507"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope I made clear during our discussions on this amendment at the earlier stage that the flexibility permitted by Schedule 3 of this Bill to retain the MoD Police at some or all ROF sites was recognised as a sensible and practical policy by both sides when this was discussed in the other place. The Government will continue to monitor security arrangements at ROF locations with the same stringency as hitherto, in the light of threat assessments and changing circumstances. We firmly believe that this flexibility is necessary so that the response will suitably match the threat at each site. We have of course recognised that some Royal Ordnance factories present a more attractive target for terrorists than others, and we have not proposed to remove the MDP from those sites. But at those sites where we do not need to rely on the full police powers of the MDP, which are quite extensive, then it only makes common sense to have the ability to withdraw them. Equally, changes are not going to happen overnight. We will be reviewing most carefully the appropriate security arrangements at each site, including any necessary improvements in physical security, and only then will decisions be taken. Such a review will of course involve consultation with all the relevant parties.<lb/>
If I may say so, I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, got it quite right. All the special constables referred to in the schedule will be members of the Ministry of Defence Police. Anything else would mean two MoD police forces, and that is most certainly not what we propose.<lb/>
At the earlier stage the noble Lord, Lord Graham, quoted to me certain parts of the report of the defence committee of the other place. I should like in turn to quote to him from that report. In paragraph 56&#x2014;and I recognise that this has already been referred to&#x2014;the report says:
<quote>"Armed MDP with constabulary powers are not the only solution in every case. Improvements in physical security could be made to offset their withdrawal from some less sensitive factories."</quote>
In paragraph 87, the report says:
<quote>"The terms in which the Government announced its new proposals make it clear that flexibility has very sensibly been retained. No deadline has been given for the replacement of the MDP at the ROFs by an in-house security force".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0032"/>
<col>47</col>
It goes on in paragraph 79:
<quote>"We acknowledged, therefore, that their replacement may be both acceptable and possible at those of the ROFs where the threat is deemed to be lowest &#x2026; A much more pragmatic approach is called for, one in which judgements are taken on a case-by-case basis and with a high degree of caution."</quote>
Then again in paragraph 80 it says:
<quote>"The first step the Government should take is to grade the ROFs in approximate order of sensitivity. At factories producing items of no interest to terrorists, armed MDP can reasonably be dispensed with".</quote>
The Committee had recommendations to make about the formation and administration of a company guardforce, recognising that such a force could replace the MOD Police at certain locations. The Government will be making their observations on that report shortly, but I can say now that we can see no objection to our retaining the flexibility which Schedule 3 currently allows for us to re-examine security matters case by case and as circumstances dictate.<lb/>
I have already assured your Lordships that we take security matters most seriously. If we are to remove the MDP from certain ROF sites, this is not simply a cost-cutting exercise. Of course, it is the Government's aim to reduce numbers and to save costs, but only where this is consistent with maintaining an adequate level of defence and security. This Government give, and will continue to give, security of arms and explosives at the ROFs the most serious consideration. But we are also custodians of public money, and where it makes sense to reduce the involvement of publicly-funded police forces without endangering security, then steps will be taken. Your Lordships need have no fear of that.<lb/>
As other noble Lords have done on earlier occasions, I have quoted at some length the report of the House of Commons Committee on this matter. As noble Lords reminded me on an earlier occasion, that report enjoyed the support of certain Conservative Members of the other place, but it also enjoyed the support of Opposition Members of the other place. Therefore, I hope that we can agree that the recommendations of that report, to which I have referred, are adequately reflected in the measures that we now bring before your Lordships, and that the noble Lord will see fit not to press his amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00508"><member>Baroness Phillips</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend on the Opposition Front Bench replies, can we assume from the Minister's statement that the Government are now considering the licensing of the independent security organisations? A quarter of a million people are employed in private armies in various security companies throughout the country. If this is to be a flexible affair, as the Minister has suggested, at some stage security companies might be brought in to carry out certain duties. Before the noble Lord rejects this suggestion out of hand, I would remind him that at Farnborough private car firms provide the cars which carry people of high security risk, and I was somewhat shocked to discover that the drivers are often recruited through a simple advertisement about a week before the event. I should like to think that they are all vetted&#x2014;I am sure they are&#x2014;but we must recognise that if we are to use
<col>48</col>
security which is not part of the state's system, that security must be accountable to someone, and I would hope that this would be a move on the part of the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00509"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I have leave to speak again, I have to say that I think that the observations from the noble Baroness go a little wide of the point we are now considering which is whether or not the Ministry of Defence police should remain completely and in perpetuity at the Royal Ordnance factory sites. I think that the site to which she referred was not such a site, if I heard her correctly. The question of licensing security firms for the purposes that the noble Baroness had in mind is a little different from the matters that we have under consideration here. The Government have made their views plain on how we see the future of these matters and I hope we can leave it to rest at that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00510"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that there remains a gulf between us. It is not a yawning gulf, but nevertheless there is a gulf. I appreciate&#x2014;and indeed it was quite fair&#x2014;that the Minister should quote to us the House of Commons Defence Committee, and of course to some degree they supported his view, though in many other parts of the paper the Government are severely criticised, as I said on Report stage. But things move on; times change; things happen which change people's minds.<lb/>
If the defence committee were making their report now, I wonder whether their view would be exactly the same after the outrage of 12th October? It may well be that, bearing in mind these circumstances&#x2014;these dreadful circumstances&#x2014;which have created a new security situation, their view might have been quite different and might, on all sides of the committee, have been completely in accordance with the views that we have been putting forward from this Dispatch Box.<lb/>
It is important that we have public confidence in our security forces and our security measures. I believe that the gulf which exists between us may well reduce public confidence. I would even now urge the Minister and the Government to think closely about this matter. Although I do not intend to press this amendment to a vote, it is a situation that we, too, shall keep our eye on. If we believe that it is necessary to come back to it in various ways with the Government, we shall certainly do so. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

A number of issues have been raised during the discussions that we have had on the Bill and I am grateful to noble Lords, in particular noble Lords opposite, for the constructive proposals that they have brought forward, even if I have not felt able to agree with them. I hope I have demonstrated during our debates that the Bill ensures that the present terms and conditions of service of the workforce&#x2014;a matter which has been very much in the minds of noble Lords opposite&#x2014;will broadly be preserved by the application of TUPE 81.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0033"/>
<col>49</col>
The employees of the ROFs will also continue to have, as I have said, the protection of other Acts of Parliament in respect of their contract of employment. The Government will continue to talk to the unions with the intention of reaching agreement on the terms of the pension scheme for transferring employees with appropriate benefits.<lb/>
A great amount of work has been proceeding during the summer on all the issues which fall outside the scope of the Bill. In preparation for the organisation to begin trading, companies have already been formed and registered under the Companies Acts, and work is proceeding satisfactorily on finalising the scheme and the memorandum of our understanding. Our aim is to achieve a vesting date at the earliest possible opportunity. The Government wish to press ahead with their plans in a constructive and responsible manner in order to promote the best interests of the ROFs, their employees, and the country as a whole.<lb/>
The Bill is a necessary first step towards our goal of increasing our ability to obtain value for money at a time of escalating defence costs. The Government will in due course announce their plans for the eventual privatisation of the company, but the important thing now is for the company to get started in business and begin to improve on the excellent record over the last 10 years of the Royal Ordnance Factories Trading Fund. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00514">Moved, that the Bill do now pass.&#x2014; (<i>Lord Trefgame</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00515"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the end of the proceedings in this House, in fact in the dying moments of the passage of this Bill, we have the opportunity to reflect on its changed shape. Before I do so, on behalf of my colleagues I want to pay a warm tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, the Minister in charge of the Bill. He has dealt both expeditiously and courteously with all the matters that have been raised from these Benches. We are grateful.<lb/>
He may have suspected at times that we took time enough to make our points so as to give him the impression that we were filibustering. He will however accept that some of the issues we raised were those vitally affecting the rights and protections of trade union members. Their livelihood is at stake. Enough at stake to warrant my noble friend Lord Stoddart and I making no apology for wearying the House time and time again with their case.<lb/>
They are very worried men and women. There has been precious little said by the Minister during the passage of the Bill through your Lordships' House to give them any real and lasting comfort. Our debates have been improved by the contributions of the noble Baroness, Lady Vickers, the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, and the noble Lords, Lord Diamond and Lord Mayhew. They have all made excellent contributions, and there were powerful contributions too from the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver. I have been grateful for the support they have all given to the points that we have made.<lb/>
We have had the benefit of receiving the Bill from another place where it had been rigorously scrutinised but hardly altered one jot voluntarily by the Government. The major change there came in adding
<col>50</col>
Schedule 3 on policing and security. Without the devastating condemnation by the defence Select Committee it was the intention of the Government to contemplate placing the security of Ordnance factories in the hands of private security organisations. We have moved away from that, and we are grateful. It was an unacceptable situation. But we remain wholly dissatisfied with Schedule 3 as presently drafted.<lb/>
I remind noble Lords however that in your Lordships' House we have achieved two major improvements, of course against the wishes of the Government. First, the bedrock of the method of transferring both assets and power from public to private hands is the making of a scheme, or schemes, by the Secretary of State. This is an enabling Bill and the Government are asking Parliament to give them the power to make schemes first and ask questions afterwards.<lb/>
Your Lordships' House supported the view that a scheme would only be made after it had been subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses. The details would be displayed, discussed, and approved first. The reality of the parliamentary arithmetic should be a comfort to the Government, yet they sought to deny either House of Parliament the chance of discussing their intentions first.<lb/>
The Government have said that they will take steps to negative your Lordships' view when this Bill goes to another place. So be it. They can do it. But I tell the Minister in clear and unambiguous terms that if that happens we shall be inviting your Lordships' House to stick to their guns, to stand up for the dignity of this noble House, and to demand that parliamentary scrutiny take place before the making of a scheme.<lb/>
Secondly, I would remind your Lordships' House that we carried a further improvement to the Bill against the wishes of the Government. Given that privatisation is to take place, your Lordships took the view that the transfer should be to one company, and not, as the Government proposed, to a company or different companies. Your Lordships heeded the plea of the workers at all levels that the unity of the Ordnance factories be respected and that they should not be chopped into little pieces.<lb/>
Again the Government have signalled their intention to negative the decision of your Lordships' House. We do not intend to treat the views of the House with the same contempt as they have signalled they intend. We shall again be prepared to reassert your Lordships' view if need be at a later stage. It is a bad Bill. This Bill is nationally a disaster. There never was a case for it. The Ordnance factories are paying the price for success and profitability: the workers are paying the price for their commitment and their loyalty. The Minister has failed lamentably to meet the legitimate fears of the workers in relation to conditions, negotiated rights, redundancies and pensions. This legislation is a further extension of the Government's obsession with privatisation, regardless of the wider considerations of national security and industrial relations. The Bill came to this House unloved and unwanted: it leaves us for another place in exactly the same state.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S5LV0456P0I0034"/>
<col>51</col>
with the tribute paid to the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne. My only regret is that so much courtesy and industry should be dedicated to such a miserable Bill.<lb/>
One of the most predictable things in British politics is that a privatisation measure will be supported by the Conservative Party and opposed by the Labour Party. If one rings the right ideological bell the two parties, like Pavlov's dogs, automatically salivate. That is what we have been seeing. On these Benches our reflexes are less conditioned. We salivate less easily, and our view is that a measure of nationalisation or privatisation should be judged on its merits; on whether it offers a practical solution to a genuine problem. I assure noble Lords opposite that if this Bill was really addressed to a genuine problem and offered a practical answer to it, we would support it. But where is the genuine problem? What has gone wrong? Where are the ROFs falling down?<lb/>
At one stage after another in the course of this Bill relays of Ministers have given their views on the ROFs. What have they said? They have praised them, invariably. They have praised the high standard of their products. They have praised their export record&#x2014;40 per cent. of their output. They have praised their increased productivity. They have praised the skill and dedication of their staffs; the close and friendly relations the ROFs have built up with the armed services. Ministers have even praised their profitability&#x2014;&#x00A3;140 million profit in the last 10 years. So why privatise?<lb/>
I have searched through every Ministerial speech and every Ministerial intervention at every stage in this Bill in both Houses. So help me, I have done it, searching for the reason why these ROFs should be privatised. I have found a few cursory references to something called "removal of restraint". It is never spelled out, and no practical examples are given. No research, committee or authority is quoted. That is all I have found; and any noble Lord who doubts me can go through the same procedure as I have, and he will reach the same conclusion.<lb/>
Since the war there have been many debates on nationalisation or denationalisation. I have attended many of them myself. But since the war, never has there been a debate in which the case for change has been made so sketchily and weakly, with so little documentation and supportive research. I doubt whether a Bill has ever been put forward which is so exclusively motivated by ideological prejudice. What makes it so deplorable is that it is in the field of national defence, and it is in this field above all that big changes should not be made for purely party political reasons. Particular care should be given not to override the longstanding loyalties of the armed services and the ROF staffs, or to overlook their 500-year record of joint service to the nation in its wars.<lb/>
Finally, who stands to gain from this Bill? Certain people will welcome it. It will be welcome to the Government stockbrokers; it will be welcome to their legal advisers, to their financial advisers and to the underwriters. It will be welcome to asset strippers and to take-over bidders. I say in all seriousness, in view of the feeble security measures in the Bill, that I think it will be welcome to the IRA as well. It is a bad Bill. My
<col>52</col>
party utterly rejects it. We think that it should never have been placed before Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00517"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to support what has been said, to apologise to the House for not being in my place at an earlier stage last week and to say how grateful I am to the Minister and to others who made courteous references to me in my absence. Your Lordships already know that we on this side of the House, whatever party we belong to, deplore this Bill for all the reasons that have been given. However objective one is in trying to see benefits from the Bill from the Government point of view, one is totally unable to do so. Speeches have been made other than from these Benches echoing what I am now saying. It is regrettable in the extreme that the Government are carrying what is clearly a deep but nevertheless dogmatic conviction to these extremes, and are allowing themselves to do so in an area where anxieties must be caused by their action.<lb/>
When this discussion started all of us on this side of the Chamber were wholly opposed to the principle of the Bill but had a fairly open mind, given that we could not affect that principle as to how it would be put into effect. Now, instead of having an open mind, we are left with having deep suspicion. The Minister should know that the net result of all his speeches has been that I and I am sure others are deeply suspicious as to why the Government are rushing this in such an unseemly way. No good reason, business or otherwise, has been given, whatever reason could be persuasive from the Government's point of view. Certainly no reason has been given which impressed itself on my mind or on the minds of any on these Benches. I am sure I can associate the Labour Benches with that statement.<lb/>
We are left, therefore, wondering why it is that the Government are rushing; are unwilling to consult Parliament and are unwilling to delay a step which affects a 400 to 500-year tradition by a total of six weeks. It is so ridiculous. The Minister must not expect to persuade anybody of that without giving the most telling and persuasive reasons. Therefore, all that can be left is our previous conviction that this is an irresponsible move on the part of the Government. It is dictated only by ideological views, however sincere the Government feel; and it can only be that and they have added mischief to unwisdom by the way they have dealt with the detail of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00518"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not believe that I need to lengthen this discussion further. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, thinks that we have been unduly rushing matters. The noble Lord will recall that, as I said earlier, we originally hoped that vesting day would be some time in October. It is now clear that we shall not achieve that, largely because we have not been rushing this measure through your Lordships' House. If we had rushed we would have sought to get the measure through Parliament before the Summer Recess and would no doubt then have achieved vesting day as originally intended. But we did not seek to do that.<lb/>
We have taken into account the views that have been expressed, and that is why we are now dealing with this Bill towards the end of October. It still has
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0035"/>
<col>53</col>
not passed into law, and vesting day will certainly not be during this month. Having said that, I am grateful for the contributions that noble Lords have made and I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Youth Training in the EEC: ECC Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00520">5.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00521"><member>Lord Seebohm</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Youth Training in the EEC (24th Report 1983&#x2013;84, H.L. 282).</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00522">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Motion before the House is to receive the Select Committee Report on Youth Training in the EEC.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00523">The EEC has taken an increasing interest in the problems of education, training and employment of young people in recent years in response to the emergence in the 1970s of youth unemployment as a major problem in most of the member states. Although the focus of attention is on young people under 25, the committee realised that the subject involved the consideration of all education and training of all young people from the beginning of secondary education until maturity and beyond. The committee realised that this would be a mammoth undertaking going well beyond the normal time scale of a select committee and it was therefore decided to concentrate on vocational training for the 16 to 18 age group; that is, the first two years after compulsory education in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00524">The inquiry aroused enormous interest and the amount of evidence that the committee received, both written and oral, was of a very high order and illustrated the great concern which exists in this country not only for youth unemployment but for the necessity to review and improve the whole education and training policies in the United Kingdom. The committee are immensely grateful for the contributions that they received and wish to express their thanks for the time and trouble that must have been incurred in the preparation of this evidence. The committee also wish to express their thanks to the special adviser Mr. Ron Johnson without whose help this report would not have seen the light of day.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00525">I would say that although it appears very long and very heavy, the report of the committee, in fact, is only of 37 pages while there are 380 pages of evidence. I hope that people will not be put off by the size from reading what we have said. This report makes some very radical proposals, some of which will be expensive to implement. The committee hope that it will convince the readers that there is really no option in the matter and I wish to say now, at the beginning of my speech, how much I shall listen to the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffhams's reply as there have already been some indications of ministerial speeches that the general principles that I shall describe are already being favourably considered. I should like also to say at this point what pleasure it must give the whole House that the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, is replying in a maiden speech to this very important
<col>54</col>
debate&#x2014;and, my Lords, who better that he with the experience that he has had? We shall certainly listen to what he has to say with great interest and I, myself, shall listen with great expectation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00526">I want to stress this about the report. The report is not concerned with short-term issues but with the long-term survival of our economy which means making a start on radical change now before it is too late. What is at stake is not only the future of the economy but the future also of society and the quality of life. The report points out that the situation of unemployed young people is critical not only because they have no jobs but because they have no chance or lack the skills to integrate into society and the world of work. There can be little doubt that a more highly trained workforce generates wealth and helps to create jobs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00527">There is also the problem of motivating people when they do not believe that there is a job at the end of the day. The EEC objective is abundantly clear. Unemployment on an unacceptable scale will not go away unless there is a highly-skilled workforce fully competitive with other countries such as America and Japan. Nor can it afford to carry laggards in its midst such as exist today. In this report, the committee describes the initiative that can be taken by the Community as a whole but accept that most of the success of the operation will depend upon action initiated within member states. The report describes the various systems of vocational training in each member state. This brings out clearly why the great variety and historical background of each state makes a common system inappropriate, but does not invalidate the acceptance of a common policy. This report therefore concentrates mainly on recommendations for change in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00528">I shall now do my best to convince your Lordships of the reasons why action so far as the United Kingdom is concerned is definitely and desperately urgent. Those who are vocationally unqualified in Germany, for instance, amount to about 30 per cent.; those who are unqualified in this country, 65 per cent.; in France, 40 per cent. of the 16 to 18 year-olds are enrolled in full-time vocational training compared with only 19 per cent. in this country. In Germany, only 10 per cent. of those in the 15 to 18 age group fall out of the vocational training net compared with 40 per cent. in the EEC and rather more in the United Kingdom. These figures alone should shake us to the core.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00529">Now I must deal with the main issues that the committee identified. These were, first, the social and material status of young people which is perhaps the most important; secondly, the quality of training; thirdly, the assessment and certification; and, fourthly, careers education and guidance. In so far as the social and material status of young people are concerned, the committee studied the practices in other member states which vary markedly. Choices at school-leaving age are likely to be influenced by estimates of future prospects and immediate financial advantage in ways which do not necessarily reflect the needs of the community or the individual. Decisions at 16 may be taken in the light of financial circumstances at the moment and the family resources available. This militates against rational choice and divides young people into different groups to no useful purpose. It
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0036"/>
<col>55</col>
also tends to demotivate some young people and to make them feel insecure at a time when they most need self-respect and a measure of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00530">After studying various approaches to this problem, the committee strongly endorsed the proposal to regard all 16-to-17 year olds as trainees or students following different groups through education or training programmes to a common goal. One immediate advantage would be to discourage a student or trainee from taking decisions about his future based primarily on immediate financial considerations. This approach is favoured by the Institute of Personnel Management who suggest that for their protection all young people in this age group should be given a defined legal status and the designation of student/trainee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00531">The main problem here would be to fix the level of income. In Europe, there is a suggestion that it should be fixed at a level which would give young people a measure of independence from parents but not enough to give them total independence. The TUC have recently issued a paper on this subject suggesting a figure of &#x00A3;25 per week for those in full-time education and &#x00A3;34 per week for those in part-time further education and part time in the workplace. Both Germany and France have a sliding scale (which I personally rather favour) starting at a much lower rate and progressing to the rate for the job as qualifications are achieved. The cost should be shared by Government and industry but the burden on industry should not be so high as to discourage it from undertaking training. But, as industry and commerce would be the main beneficiaries, it is not unreasonable to expect them to bear a proportion of the cost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00532">In Germany, the cost of their three-year programme&#x2014;for 15&#x2013;16&#x2013;17 year-olds, because the compulsory school age stops at 15&#x2014;is estimated as the equivalent of about &#x00A3;5 billion. In the United Kingdom as the school-leaving age is a year later, the cost would be that much less and the saving in social security and family allowances must also be calculated. In so far as the quality of training is concerned, the committee considered the working of the YTS and look forward to seeing some further analysis of the successes and failures of the first year's working. There is a report of the MSC of 1983&#x2013;84 period; but that ends in July and that, of course, is too early to do a proper analysis of what had been happening during the first year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00533">The committee believe that one year must be followed by a second year if the foundation laid by the first YTS preparation year is not to be dissipated. Unless steps are taken to supplement the one-year programme, the United Kingdom is in danger of falling even further behind the other member states. This further training should, wherever possible, lead to a recognised occupational qualification. I have had the opportunity to visit two youth opportunities schemes. The first one was in a large, high technology company, where they had 21 students, youngsters of 16 years of age, completely by random selection, of which only four or five had any qualifications from the school.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00534">It was astonishing, after six months, when I went there, how those who had no qualifications whatsoever had produced quite amazing aptitudes and skills in a
<col>56</col>
very short time&#x2014;aptitudes and skills which so impressed the company that they told me that five or six of them, not necessarily those with any qualifications at all, would be taken on to their permanent staff at the end. They had never taken on school-leavers before. Like many other employers, if they took on people they inquired first of all whether they had O-levels or A-levels. To my mind, this showed how important are two things. First, a second year is absolutely essential so that these motivated young people should not again be disappointed; and, secondly, the whole question of certification should be looked at.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00535">This brings me to the third issue, which concerns assessment and certification. The committee point out that a certificate which describes in nationally-understood terms what a young person has achieved and what he can do is clearly of value when the time comes to seek employment or to undertake further study. An appropriate assessment method has another value. It motivates the young to learn; it helps them to chart their own progress; and it also helps to provide a feed-back on the adequacy of the training or educational programme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00536">According to the Institute of Personnel Management, the system of profile recording as a means of continuous assessment can itself be a vehicle for learning, and has many advantages over end-of-term examinations, which result in 60 per cent. of school-leavers having nothing to show for the eleven years of education they have received. The committee feels strongly that every school-leaver should be entitled to a certificate of achievement which lists their attainments, even though these attainments do not meet all the aims set out in the course. This should also avoid the appalling "pass/failure" hurdle which commits many to failure even though they have a highly-developed aptitude which does not form part of the examination system. I am now straying, I am afraid, from the 16 and 17 year-olds, but there should be no great break from compulsory education to vocational training, and the artificial distinction between education and training should be scotched at birth.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00537">The fourth and final issue I mentioned concerns the careers education and guidance services. I imagine all would agree that careers education should be an integral part of general education. Young people need from a very early age continuous help in identifying and developing their aptitudes, and in being made aware of the range of choices. This has implications for teacher training and also for the present isolation of the teaching profession, which was pointed out in the evidence from the Policy Studies Institute. It must be difficult for careers teachers to give adequate advice and guidance to young people when they have spent their entire careers in teaching and the school environment. There are some useful schemes in existence, such as UBI, which is sponsored by the CBI and Understanding Industry, sponsored by a private trust; and, of course, there is the new development of the TVEI, which seems to be extremely successful. They are making some impact, but it should not be left to these informal and voluntary initiatives to make all the running. The committee feel that the status and role of the careers service and of careers education should be
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0037"/>
<col>57</col>
raised and that this service should be available to all those who are at school and all those at university, in jobs or unemployed, at least up to the age of 25.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00538">I now come to our main conclusions. I cannot mention them all as there are rather a lot of them, and there are other speakers who may know more than I do about some of them. I shall deal with three of them. First, the need for an efficient workforce is a matter for the whole of the EEC, which cannot afford to carry member states who are unwilling to take steps to improve their performance. Secondly, every young person should have the opportunity of a training programme lasting at least one year after the YTS foundation year. Wherever possible, this further training should lead to a recognised occupational qualification. Thirdly, a common status for all young people should be the United Kingdom's long-term answer to the problem of the social and material status of young people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00539">To sum up, the current education and vocational training provision for young people should be restructured with a view to long-term improvement, and this should start now so that there will be, first, a well-trained workforce; secondly, a straightforward system that everyone understands and can benefit from; and, thirdly, the opportunity for young people to be helped to make sound choices on education, training and employment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00540">I hope I have said enough to convince your Lordships that the time has come to ensure that adequate provision is made, not only to meet academic needs but also the needs of the hand and of the heart. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00541">Moved, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Youth Training in the EEC.&#x2014; (<i>Lord Seebohm</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00542">6.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00543"><member>The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Young of Graffham)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to address your Lordships' House for the first time with considerable humility and reliant upon the knowledge that your Lordships' reputation is to deal kindly with newcomers. For one who has not come from another place&#x2014;in fact, from no place at all&#x2014;the task is formidable, and your Lordships may prefer to regard this afternoon as the first module of on-the-job training in what I can only describe as the Young Training Scheme.<lb/>
I am indeed grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, not only for what he has had to say today but for all the work that he and the other members of the Select Committee have put into the 24th Report, <i>Youth Training in the EEC</i>. The evidence they have taken and assembled will prove to be of the greatest utility to those of us concerned with policy in the field of education and the training of our young. I am sure noble Lords would want to join me in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, and all his committee for their work.<lb/>
Moreover, the report comes at a particularly crucial time. Training and the proper preparation of young people for work have never been more important. Our economic recovery will be threatened unless we get these things right, for only if our workforce is properly trained in the right skills can we produce the goods and
<col>58</col>
services which people want to buy, and so generate new wealth and, with it, new jobs. That is why the Government accord training such a high priority. No-one is more aware of that than me, since it was my privilege to spend 2&#x00BD; years at the head of the Manpower Services Commission. Indeed, it is even more appropriate to hold this debate this afternoon, since almost at this very moment my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment is announcing the appointment of my successor. He is Mr. Bryan Nicholson, at present chairman of Rank Xerox (U.K.), with executive responsibility for Rank Xerox subsidiaries elsewhere in Europe. With a long experience of industry, he will bring to the Manpower Services Commission a vision of the needs of tomorrow's world. I hope that in addition to my own I might be permitted to add the warm welcome of your Lordships' House. I well recall my own appointment to the Commission and the help and active support from commissioners and officials alike. I envy Mr. Nicholson the experience. It is a key appointment and, with his experience and ability, I know that he will prove to be an improvement on his predecessor.<lb/>
As a nation, we have not fully recognised the importance of proper work preparation and vocational training, and the report points out that it is not only this country that faces these difficulties. Rising unemployment, particularly among young people, is a Europe-wide problem. In April 1984, over 12 million people were registered as unemployed in the European Community&#x2014;an increase of over five million in three-and-a-half years&#x2014;and young people have been particularly hard-hit, for demographic factors have worked against them and have meant that youngsters have been coming on to the labour market in substantially greater numbers. Technological development and changes in the industrial structure, particularly the shift from manufacturing to the service sector, have at the same time been affecting all the Western economies. The effect of both economic conditions and technological development has been to raise the skill levels which young people need if they are to get employment.<lb/>
The need for adequate opportunities for training and retraining and for young people to be properly prepared for work has been a proper concern of this Government. We have published two White Papers on the subject, one in 1981 and one early this year. These reiterated the Government's support for the three national objectives set out in the Manpower Service Commission's consultative document, <i>A New Training Initiative</i>. We want to secure, as the first objective, the modernisation of training and occupational skills, and to update apprenticeships. The second objective is better preparation in school and college for working life, and better arrangements for the transition from education to work. This is a field which is largely covered at the moment by the youth training scheme and by the technical and vocational education initiative.<lb/>
The third objective, which is increasingly of concern, but is perhaps outside the field of this debate, is wider opportunities for adults to acquire and improve their skills. These are ambitious aims, but we must achieve them if we are to build upon the economic advances that we have already made; for
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0038"/>
<col>59</col>
unless we have a flexible system of training which can respond quickly and cost effectively to the changing skill requirements of industry, we cannot hope to produce goods of the quality and price which the market demands.<lb/>
For the whole secret of our ability to survive in such an increasingly hostile world is to reduce our unit costs, and for that skill and professionalism is required. Many of your Lordships will, I hope, recall the game played many years ago now at Lord's each season&#x2014;Gentlemen against the Players. For all too many years we have played for the Gentlemen, but I am afraid that in today's world we have to play for the Players and become more professional in our approach and that means better training.<lb/>
In that particular sense, training is an investment. It is not an end in itself, but is something which leads to jobs. It pays for itself by enabling people to provide goods and services which they will sell and so create new wealth. And it follows from this that employers have a key role to play in providing training. They decide who should be trained and in what skills. It is certainly no good Government thinking that they know best. We have tried that in the past and it has not worked.<lb/>
But, of course, there are roles for others. In particular, individual trainees must accept that the training they receive can be costly and should be taken into account in settling the level of pay. Perhaps they could also show enterprise in making use of the many training opportunities today available to them; for example, through the Open Tech programme. And, of course, many individuals already in employment are taking part-time training programmes, for they know that the result of these programmes will boost their earning power.<lb/>
But I would not deny that there are important responsibilities for Government. Where necessary, we must provide special help for those disadvantaged in the labour market, such as the young, the disabled and the unemployed. We have made great strides since 1981. The youth training scheme, which offers a year of work and training to minimum age school-leavers and to some other people, started life in April 1983 and became fully operational in September of that year. We are now at the beginning of its second year and nearly 50 per cent. more young people have joined the scheme as during the same period last year. They know that it works. They voted with their feet and they are increasingly coming on the scheme. Some 300,000 youngsters were on the scheme at the end of September. Initial indications, too, are favourable and nearly 60 per cent. of young people leaving the scheme are finding work. If you include those going on to further education and training, the figure approaches 70 per cent.<lb/>
As regards individual schemes, the Construction Industry Training Board, which is by far the largest managing agent, reports that well over 90 per cent. have gone into employment, while the figure for the Clothing and Allied Products Industrial Training Board is 98 per cent. In the case of ABTA, the travel agents' scheme, the figure is 100 per cent. Of course, not all the schemes are on this scale, but it goes to show
<col>60</col>
the central thesis of the youth training scheme, that young people with the right approach and the right skills can find work.<lb/>
The success of the youth training scheme is a credit to employers, the careers service, local authorities, trade unions, voluntary organisations and colleges and even, if I may say so now, to the Manpower Services Commission who run the scheme. We are very grateful to them for all their efforts. I must at least say a word to the Area Manpower Boards, some of whose chairmen are in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
Within the youth training scheme we have not ignored the new technologies. I should like to pay particular tribute to the ITeCs (the Information Technology Centres) of which we already have 148 open, and the number is still increasing. These have shown that young people without any qualifications can master the mysteries of programming, of boolean logic, and even dare I say it, of maths. These have shown that the deficiencies are in the system, rather than in our young. These have shown the need to restore a better balanced curriculum to our school system&#x2014;one that motivates and interests all of our young, not just those who are naturally academic. Indeed, if this were not my first occasion before your Lordships, I might be tempted on this issue, if on no other, to be controversial.<lb/>
It was to remedy this defect that the Prime Minister announced the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative in November 1982. Greeted with a certain amount of suspicion, and some may even say hostility, from a very conservative profession, TVEI has now got off to a flying start. It is about an enriched curriculum&#x2014;one that provides both general and technical or vocational subjects. If any of your Lordships have seen the enthusiasm of both pupils and teachers alike, the realisation of some of our young that they are capable, that they have abilities, that school means something for them, then you will be as sure as I am that the changes we have encouraged are here to stay. I say "encouraged", because in all of this the teaching profession is ahead of us. My only regret, if I were to be honest, is that there have been some politicians in some local education authorities who have denied their school systems the opportunity of entering the programme. Perhaps they thought that they were harming the Government. Alas, they are harming only their own.<lb/>
So eight months after it was announced, 14 local education authorities started their pilot schemes and the following year&#x2014;August and September&#x2014;43 authorities in England and Wales and a further five in Scotland have started their pilot schemes. I hope that before much time has passed all who wish to will have the resources. In Clwyd, it is already planned to spread the programme across the entire authority.<lb/>
But that is not all. The Government are encouraging in other ways better preparation in schools for working life. Links between schools and industry are being strengthened. The certificate of pre-vocational education is one of a number of measures designed to improve and better co-ordinate the arrangements for vocational education after 16. In further education, the transfer of some of the resources for the funding of work-related non-advanced further education in

England and Wales to the Manpower Services Commission will, I am quite sure, help make this type of provision more responsive to the quickly changing employment needs of the future.<lb/>
And in Scotland important developments in this area are also under way. The committee's report referred to the new courses in the Scottish certificate of education standard grade and to the "16+ Action Plan" of January 1983, under which a flexible system of modular courses leading to a single new vocational certificate is being developed. The more I saw of education north of the border, the more I thought that we should study it further.<lb/>
We are mainly concerned today with youth training, though in European terms that covers young people up to the age of 25. But action to develop the potential of young adults, as well as to improve the skills of many others in the work force, is just as critical to our economic success. We just cannot afford to let skill shortages hold us back. I was delighted when, as part of the Manpower Services Commission, we developed the adult training strategy and even more delighted when it was announced earlier this year. The cornerstone of this is our belief that employers have the key role to play in providing training and that investment in training pays. That is why my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced recently that as part of this strategy we are launching shortly a major campaign to bring home to everybody in this country&#x2014;employers, unions and employees&#x2014;the vital importance of training for our future.<lb/>
The Government are playing their part in two principal ways. First, we are putting a great deal of effort into stimulating changes in the training system to make it more responsive to the needs of employers and adult workers&#x2014;through, for example, our funding of the Open Tech Programme and of projects to promote local collaboration between employers and providers of training. Secondly, we are restructuring the Government's own adult training programmes to make a more cost-effective contribution to meeting the needs of industry and commerce. Through tailoring provision to meet specific needs, by 1986&#x2013;87 we are doubling to over 250,000 the number of adults who benefit from our training programmes within the current level of resources. About half of those helped will be unemployed people, including some 50,000 of the 200,000 long-term unemployed who pass through the community programme each year. Many of us who have been concerned with the very real needs of the long-term unemployed are delighted that at long last we can include a training element for their particular requirements.<lb/>
I hope noble Lords will agree that these are considerable achievements. Britain certainly matches up well to the standards set by the European Community which we have helped to influence. For example, the vocational training resolution adopted by the Council of Ministers last year requires member states to do their utmost over the next five years to ensure that all young people may have a minimum of six months of basic training and/or initial work experience when they reach minimum school-leaving age. Our youth training scheme already provides such a guarantee, but for 12 months. Because we do so much for our young people, we benefit correspond-
<col>62</col>
ingly from the European Social Fund, from which we receive more than any other member state. The United Kingdom is also undertaking the majority of the pilot projects which have so far been approved under the fund rules and to which, of course, your Lordships' report refers.<lb/>
That is a brief overview of where we are in the provision of training for our young. There is one final matter that I would like to raise now although I would hope, with the leave of the House, to respond at a later stage in our debate to any detailed points on the report which your Lordships may make. Could I, however, say at this stage to the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, that we are quite aware of the gap between the amount of initial training and vocational training that is provided in the United Kingdom and Germany. From our point of view, however, our concern is whether or not the gap is closing. The advances that we have made in the last two years are, I believe, very much in the right direction.<lb/>
One of your Lordships' recommendations in paragraph 84 is to bring together the education, training and employment of young people in a coherent framework, a framework which can be understood by all, in particular by the young themselves. Your Lordships may recall that the Prime Minister, after discussion with the Ministers concerned, asked me a short time ago to chair a committee composed of junior Ministers and senior officials from the Departments of Education and Science, Employment, Trade and Industry and Health and Social Security. This group will look for the very first time at the provision for the 14 to 18 age group&#x2014;education, training, employment and unemployment. We shall in due course, and before too long, report back to our colleagues.<lb/>
I should not like to raise the expectations of this House, for it is a formidable task. Your Lordships will recall that the recent youth training scheme review group within the Manpower Services Commission did not recommend a longer scheme at the present time, but there are other matters&#x2014;for example, the relationship between the Certificate of Pre-Vocational Education (CPVE) and the youth training scheme and in particular the status of certificates under the scheme&#x2014;which need to be considered and taken into account.<lb/>
I have no doubt that your Lordships will raise many more points this afternoon. All I will say is that we shall have a good look for the very first time across the whole field of youth activity. I am encouraged by the enthusiasm of my colleagues.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00545"><member>Lord McCarthy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first may I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, on his excellent report. We on this side of the House agree with almost everything that is contained in it. There are one or two areas with which I disagree. At least, I think I disagree, if I have got it right. It may be that I have not got it right and that therefore I shall find that in the end I agree. I wish also to ask a number of questions of the Government spokesman.<lb/>
I am very pleased to be the first person who is able, <i>post hoc</i>, to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Young

<col>63</col>
of Graffham, upon discharging his first module. It was, as we expected it to be, a clear, encyclopaedic and almost non-controversial maiden speech. I hope to hear from him again on many occasions. Indeed, I know that I shall hear again from him soon. He is, with leave, to sum up the debate. I have always looked upon the noble Lord as the distinguished chairman of the Manpower Services Commission&#x2014;the last place left in this Government where one can admit that one can learn from trade unions and the last place left where shameful tripartite quangos produce results and sometimes get Ministers to change their minds. It is something left over from the 1970s. I have a great affection for it and also a great admiration for the extremely useful, conciliatory and helpful task which the noble Lord has performed as the Chairman of the Manpower Services Commission.<lb/>
I turn now to the subject matter of the report and congratulate the members of the committee upon what they have put before us. I do so for a number of reasons. First, within a very short time span, they have summarised, as the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, said, the incontestable conclusions to which any sensible person must come when he compares the level, scope, form and general standard of training in this country with what is provided by our major competitors. They have shown once again that we do much less training than most of our major competitors and that the training which we provide, compared with that of many of our major competitors, is of a comparatively low standard and on a comparatively narrow base. They have shown how tremendously we need to expand this provision. They have shown the extra special need we have to expand training because of the fact, which is highlighted in the report of the Select Committee, that no post-war Government have yet managed to shift the basic assumptions about our educational system away from the over-domination of the needs of the top 40 per cent.&#x2014;indeed, I sometimes think it is the top 5 per cent.&#x2014;to the needs of the bottom 40 per cent. Because of the extreme difficulty of changing that balance, for which the older universities are as responsible as anybody else, it is especially important for us to supplement our classical, liberal education with training which is based upon work. This is spelled out very clearly and straightforwardly in the report.<lb/>
But the Select Committee have done more than this. They have also shown that the specific tasks which need to be carried out in order to improve training are to be found in one of the great areas left in this country where already there is a very wide consensus of opinion. One of the most impressive aspects of the report is the evidence put forward by the CBI, the TUC, the MSC, local authorities, the Institute of Personnel Management and distinguished academics. It shows a very wide area of general agreement upon the way forward. Although the noble Lord the Minister knows this, I must warn him that he will not find a comforting area of consent and agreement when he moves into his present area of concern: what is to be done about unemployment. At least when we debate what one should do about training and the way forward in training there is to me, as an old consensualist, a comforting area of agreement. For
<col>64</col>
example, everybody knows that the first and most important thing to do after the establishment of the youth training scheme is provide a second year of training. Everybody knows that at the end of that second year of training there must be recognised occupational qualifications based on continuous assessment and examination.<lb/>
Although I shall return later to what the Government are doing in this regard, I believe that everyone in general agrees&#x2014;and the noble Lord said so in one part of his speech&#x2014;on the need to do more for the disadvantaged in this context, on the need to do more for the educationally backward, and on the need to do more for the heart of our unemployment problem&#x2014;the long-term unemployed.<lb/>
I hope there is agreement that, to some extent, in the immediate future this last objective can only be approached by a greater concentration on what is termed Mode B (1) and (2) of the youth training scheme, or a concentration on the community programme, or on the community industry programme&#x2014;rather than focus to the same extent we have so far on Mode 1 of the youth training scheme. I say that because I believe it is generally agreed, and it is spelt out in the report, that it is the disadvantaged, the educationally backward and the long-term unemployed&#x2014;especially the latter in areas of very high unemployment&#x2014;who find it difficult to become absorbed into Mode A of the youth training scheme.<lb/>
I should like to ask the Minister for his justification, if he accepts these figures, of the fact put forward recently by Youth Aid that if one looks at the number of places for Mode B which are to be available in 1984&#x2013;85 as against those available in 1983&#x2013;84, it is evident that the Government propose something like a 20 per cent. reduction in the total number of places; a reduction from 89,000 in 1983&#x2013;84 to 70,000 in 1984&#x2013;85. If those figures are wrong I should be pleased to have them corrected.<lb/>
Is it also wrong, as Youth Aid suggests, that this reduction in the number of places for Mode B is in no way related to demand for places&#x2014;for example, in the Midlands, Scotland, and the South-East, where the reductions are rather high&#x2014;to the success in filling places this year? Indeed, Youth Aid says&#x2014;and I should be glad to be told that they are wrong&#x2014;that the cuts in the proportion of Mode B places as against Mode A places are simply an ideological spasm. If it be true as the Minister has said, that he appreciates the need to do more for the disadvantaged and the long-term unemployed, then I should be glad to be told that those figures are wrong.<lb/>
That brings me to those areas where I am not sure that I agree with the Seebohm report, if I have it right. I am not sure I understand what the report means by a need for a common status and a common income for young people. I am not sure what it means when it refers to a need for a national framework; for a more coherent, clear, rational framework of training. If by common status it merely means that the committee are against parent dependence and want a system of allowances rather than the present system, then I am in favour; I see what they mean. If the committee mean by the common approach that they are against what I believe to be the impractical proposals put forward by
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0041"/>
<col>65</col>
the Policy Studies Institute for a value added way of calculating the allowance, then I agree with them. But if they are asking&#x2014;and this seems to me to be the common sense way of looking at the matter&#x2014;not simply for a common status but for a common rate of allowance, then I would prefer (and I say this now especially because I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, is to follow me) the approach put forward in the report of the Select Committee of this House on unemployment. What we suggested there was not a common rate but a hierarchy of rates; a bottom rate for the unemployed and for full-time education and training&#x2014;for students, yes, so that there should not be argued for a hierarchical system with a bottom common rate and a top rate for full-time training, and sociology and English literature rather than go on a youth training scheme.<lb/>
But surely there should be some extra compensation for people undertaking work rather then training and some appreciation of the employer's position so that he will be compensated if the worker is away for training rather than working at his place of work. We argued for a hierarchical system with a bottom common rate and a top rate for full-time training, and rates <i>per diem</i> in between based on the proportion of full-time training or the proportion of full-time work. I must say that I am not convinced that what I think is behind that which is proposed in this report is a better system. I wait to see whether I have understood it correctly.<lb/>
I shall now go on to the second area, which will not take very long. Once again, the people who study our system of provision in this area find it chaotic. They are quite right to do so. They say it is unbelievable that we should have three or four ministries, a large number of universities, polytechnics, CFEs, local authorities, the MSC itself, the schools council, and so on and so on&#x2014;all involved in this area. They end up by saying that there must be a better way and that there must be a coherent national framework. I believe that I heard the noble Lord the Minister say that he was going to chair a committee to investigate this coherent, national framework. I also heard him say&#x2014;and I am very glad that he did say it&#x2014;that we should not be too ambitious in our expectations.<lb/>
The example he proposed of the kind of tinkering rationalisation he might produce as a result of this committee reassured me very much. If the Seebohm committee is suggesting a radical change, this was something we considered in the report of the Select Committee on unemployment. We considered four forms of radical change. The late Lord Vaizey was in favour of a monster ministry of training which took everything over. Others were in favour of an elephantine, gargantuan enlargement of the MSC. Others believed in regionalisation and merging the functions of the MSC with the local authorities. And the local authorities gave evidence and said, "Hand it all back to us". When one considers the institutional upheaval involved in any major attempt to change the institutional chaos whereby we provide training in this country, the kind of tinkering which the noble Lord suggested is the best that one can do. I hope that he does not try to do anything else.<lb/>
I come now to the questions that I should like to put to the Minister. Actually, I should like to ask a number
<col>66</col>
of questions about three areas. The first concerns the results of the youth training scheme itself and the proportion of those coming off the scheme who are gainfully employed. If I heard the Minister aright today, the figures he gave seemed to be rather more reasonable. We have heard claims from Ministers that on one occasion 70 per cent. of people coming off the YTS were going back to work. One spokesman for the MSC claimed that 69 per cent. of people coming off the Youth Training Scheme were, "doing something useful". If one looks at how this "doing something useful" was calculated, one finds that it was calculated by taking away the unemployed who answered the sample survey and who said that they intended at some time in the future to apply for some form of training or education. The figure was calculated by taking them off and adding them to those who were "doing something useful". I believe that the figure put forward today&#x2014;I think he said 56 per cent.&#x2014;is much more realistic.<lb/>
On the other hand, as I understand it this was a small sample. All the samples which have so far been held by the MSC to calculate the results of the youth training scheme have been postal samples and it is notorious that with postal samples one gets rather low responses. These were a little above 60 per cent. It is also notorious that the majority of non-responders are non-achievers. They have nothing much to tell you so they do not fill in your form. One need only assume that slightly more than half of those who did not respond did not, in fact, get a job and we have a rate of placement which is under 50 per cent.&#x2014;something not much better than that achieved by the youth opportunities programme.<lb/>
I stress that I do not say this in any sense in order to glory at the downfall of the youth training scheme, if it be a sign of downfall. It is a very difficult thing to do. But if we are to run the youth training scheme for a second year and if we are to supplement it, as I hope we shall, with something on the second year, then we must be very hard-headed and realistic and not make over-ambitious claims about what the youth training scheme can achieve. I hope the Minister will say that he agrees.<lb/>
I shall now say a word or two about the young workers' scheme. The young workers' scheme is the most contentious part of the programme of special measures. It has no training element. It has a subsidy which is inversely related to wages in an attempt to price people into jobs. It has no controls whatever to ensure that there is any net job creation. The 200,000 or so people who have been on the young workers' scheme could, in fact, for all we know, have replaced 200,000 rather older people at the other end. Nevertheless, the young workers' scheme, says the MSC in its evidence to the Select Committee which we are discussing today, has been interfering, or putting people off from entering the youth training scheme. The MSC says in its evidence that it would like to see the young workers' scheme transformed into a second year scheme so that young people are expected to spend their first year on the youth training scheme and the second year on the young workers' scheme.<lb/>
Interestingly enough, in the evidence of the TUC, at page 140, we find that Mr. Roy Jackson, the secretary
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0042"/>
<col>67</col>
of the education department of the TUC, actually agrees with this proposal. Therefore, my question is: does the Minister agree? Obviously he agreed when he was chairman of the MSC. Does he still agree that the best way forward for the young workers' scheme is to get out of the way, as it were, of the youth training scheme and provide the basis for a second year scheme? If he does, surely there is a case for considering a system of controls to ensure that there is some positive job creation. Surely there is a case, if there is to be a subsidy, for letting that subsidy be neutral; and surely there is a case for introducing a training element.<lb/>
Finally, I ask one or two questions about the link between unemployment and training. Do the Government agree with the report of the Select Committee when it states:
<quote>"Lack of training is not in itself the main cause of unemployment. There simply are less jobs available"?</quote>
If the Government say that, we shall have moved an inch forward. If they do, how do the Government accept that in the light of what was said by the Chancellor of the Exchequer recently when he told Brian Walden on "Weekend World"&#x2014;or is supposed to have said, according to the <i>Financial Times</i>&#x2014;that unemployment is a social human problem rather than an economic one. Like the crime rate, it is essentially beyond the power of Government. If that is the case, it puts the Minister in rather a difficult position because he has moved away from an area such as training, where something can be done and where the Government are doing a great deal, to an area where the Chancellor of the Exchequer tells him that his task is essentially beyond the power of Government. If that is the case, I do not see that one can agree with that part of the Select Committee's Report.<lb/>
I hope that the Minister can say today, or if not today at some time in the near future, that he does not fully accept that the level of unemployment&#x2014;admittedly, not centrally a matter of lack of training&#x2014;is something that is essentially beyond the powers of Government; that it is something social and human rather than economic and that it is something, one might say, which really should be the province of the Home Office rather than the Treasury. There is no theoretical justification for this and no practical justification. It will be better by far to assume that something can be done and to assume that something can be done partly on the training side through the excellent provisions in this report, which I commend to the House.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00547"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it gives me very special pleasure to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, on his maiden speech on a subject which we have discussed, in one way or another, in this House on a number of occasions and which has occupied the minds, and indeed the hearts, of many of us for many years. It gives me very special pleasure, in addition to those more general considerations, because I have had the privilege of sitting under the noble Lord, Lord Young, as chairman of one of his area boards. I have seen him in action spurring the MSC on with new ideas and with a great determination to achieve results.<lb/>
<col>68</col>
Like the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, I think the noble Lord, Lord Young, is an extremely brave man to take on the task in which he attempts to co-ordinate four Government departments. My own very small experience has been that if one has to deal with more than one Government department at a time it makes one's heart sink. The thought of taking on four at one blow requires the courage of a very brave man indeed.<lb/>
Running through this report of the EC on youth training there are two main themes which seem to me to be of great importance and on which I should like briefly to comment. The first is the theme of the need for diversity in training. I was delighted to see that the committee is in favour of&#x2014;indeed, has recognised and the EC has recognised&#x2014;a much needed change from the idea that there would be an imposed EC standard of training to occupational descriptions; in other words, that we would work out what it was that young people, or indeed adults, were going to be able to do. Having decided that, we would work out in our own way&#x2014;and this will differ in various countries and may indeed differ within the same country&#x2014;the training and educational methods by which the standard needed to do the job so described is reached. This is a very important distinction.<lb/>
Those of us who have been on European committees for some time will remember how some years ago we were bogged down with an attempt to find standards of professional qualifications which were acceptable in all the EC countries. They got into the most ridiculous situation of counting the number of hours that students attended on different aspects of courses. Those of us who have had anything to do with teaching students know very well that the hours that they spend in lectures, especially their own, are probably the least profitable that they spend in training courses. I remember one famous don at Cambridge in my day saying that three hours in the library was worth a term full of lectures. That has always been my view.<lb/>
Students were suppoed to have attended a particular set of lectures, and if they only put in the hours, whether they had slept through them or whether they had been doing noughts and crosses at the back of the hall, they had attended them. That is what was required. This was ridiculous, and it held up the necessary free movement of labour inside the Community.<lb/>
I myself believe&#x2014;and I think that sometimes during the discussion on the report it is to some extent forgotten&#x2014;that this is an EEC report. I know that a great deal of what has to be done has to be done inside this country and inside member states, but there is an EEC dimension. One of the most encouraging experiences I had in visiting a skill centre was when a man said to me, when I asked him what he thought were his prospects, "Not too bad. Three of them who were with me went off to Germany on Monday to a job"&#x2014;and this was three years ago&#x2014;"at &#x00A3;250 per week". The opportunity to go and work in other parts of the EEC will be facilitated because it has been accepted that the training given is training which enables trainees to do the job as described. This contrasts with the existing regulations, which prevent movement within the Community when the training undertaken is not identical with the detailed training requirements laid down at the centre by the EEC.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0043"/>
<col>69</col>
But the need for diversity is not limited to diversity as between member states. It is also important to have diversity in the approach to training inside this country. I recognise that it is important that there should be nationally recognised standards. However, I do see a very great danger, if we attempt to move too quickly towards nationally recognised standards, that we shall have fixed standards before we know what training the youngsters really need to have. Once we have those fixed standards, the training will be directed towards meeting the requirements of the standards and we shall move further and further away from recognising that we need to learn far more than we know at present what the youngsters really need to learn in order to do the required jobs.<lb/>
So I am anxious that we should not move too quickly towards nationally recognised standards and that we should more humbly approach the job by trying to find out how we can do this very difficult job of training the whole of our labour force&#x2014;because this is what we are now attempting to do. In the past, we have trained&#x2014;in some cases extremely well&#x2014;a very small proportion of the labour force. We are now trying to train nearly everybody. This is a quite different exercise, and a very difficult one indeed. One is trying to train people who are thankful that they have left school and who had hoped that they would never see any sort of training or educational establishment again. We do not know how to do this. We have to learn, and we have to learn very slowly.<lb/>
So there is a question of diversity, of experiment, of finding out how these youngsters with different kinds of interests and ability can learn to be competent for the jobs which they are going to do. This is the nature of the task. So can we not work towards a system in which we recognise that what is being done in one part of the country is in many ways experimentally different in training approach from what is being done in another, but that nonetheless people who have passed through what is approved in a particular locality and have reached approved standards there will not be barred from access to jobs in other parts of the country? It is simply a word of warning against standardisation; because one knows so well that, once there is standardisation, all teaching is directed towards the requirements of that standard and you lose sight of what we are trying to do now, which is to work out how the youngsters can best be trained for the jobs for which in the past they did not get any training at all, and for the new jobs that they have to do. So much for diversity.<lb/>
The second theme, and the theme of the youth training scheme, as of this report, is the theme of quality. The youth training scheme stands or falls by the achievement of quality. However, quality can only be achieved if we start way back in the schools. The fact of the matter is that to get the quality that we need requires a degree of collaboration between educationists and industrialists which we have not begun to achieve. These two groups are in many cases poles apart. There is a very great deal of suspicion, misunderstanding and lack of appreciation on both sides. Yet, unless this is overcome we are not going to achieve the quality, because the quality is a result of collaboration between the two groups.<lb/>
<col>70</col>
The report speaks rightly about the importance of the careers guidance system. That certainly needs to start far earlier in the lives of youngsters in schools than at present. So often it comes after the key choice of subjects has been made. Therefore, youngsters&#x2014;and particularly girls&#x2014;set out on the wrong path because they have been allowed to drop mathematics, they have been allowed to choose the softer rather than the harder sciences. Then, when the job choices have to be made they find that they have been prepared quite wrongly inside the school. After all&#x2014;and I will not repeat it&#x2014;we all know that at last women now comprise rather more than half of the population. Their contribution to the economy is of great importance. However, we are still preparing them very inadequately in the schools for the kind of work that they are going to have to do in the future.<lb/>
So we have this very tough job of getting the people in the education system and the people inside industry to work together. In that connection, may I say how impressed I was when I had the opportunity to visit one of the technical and vocational educational initiative programmes in the area in which I am area board chairman. It seemed to me that this was serving a number of very important purposes. It was providing training and education&#x2014;and the distinction between the two words is almost by definition lost. It is fused in the very title of "the programme".<lb/>
But not only was this providing a very good foundation for the youngsters who were taking it: it was forcing the teachers and the people in the industry to come together, both to develop and to work on the programme. So they were sitting around a table, talking to each other, thrashing out the problems, finding out that the people from the other side, as they saw them, were not the people with horns that they thought they were in the past, and that they could collaborate in working out a common programme. So this is educational, not only to the youngsters but, perhaps even more important, to the educators and to the people in industry. Here and in the development of this scheme, I believe there is a great deal of hope.<lb/>
Also after the school stage, in the training programme, based on work, if we are to get the right educational component it is essential that the people from the educational institutions, colleges of further education, should come to understand what is required inside a place of work, and to develop their courses at colleges of further education to fit the needs of the trainees. My experience is that this is being done in some colleges but too often still there is a standardised course which it is hoped that the trainee will take when he goes along to a college of further education.<lb/>
My experience of talking to the trainees, admittedly in a limited area of the country, is that what they are finding most difficult to take is the 13 weeks of job training. The one word that they use again and again is a three syllable word which they have all learned&#x2014;"relevance", or, rather, the lack of it. Until we overcome that we shall not get the integration which is absolutely vital if we are going to have the quality that we want. I will not deal with this in detail but I think there are one or two points in achieving this integration which I should like to suggest should be examined.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0044"/>
<col>71</col>
I have come across the point that in assessing the value of the contribution of people in the colleges a great deal of importance is attached to, and points are gained by, class contact&#x2014;student contact inside the college. But contact inside the place of work, which is surely essential if we are to get collaboration&#x2014;the person from the college going along to the place where the youngster works and discussing with the industrialist and the youngster himself what are the kind of courses that would really help him&#x2014;counts very little in terms of valuing what the teacher is doing and what the college is doing. I suspect that pay systems, grading systems and opportunities for promotion&#x2014;matters which are of the greatest importance to academics&#x2014;are being governed by an out-of-date view of what kind of things should be going on inside the colleges. This is something that would need detailed discussion with the representatives of the teachers in the colleges. But there is more than a hint, as one moves around, that they are held back from the kind of collaborative developments that one would like to see because of the regulations, controls and antiquated systems under which they are paid and promoted. I suggest that it would be of great advantage to have some detailed examination of the consequences of this kind of problem.<lb/>
Quality starts in the schools and is continued by collaboration between educationists and industrialists. There will be no quality, no good scheme and no trained labour force unless you make a success of that. But quality also results from assessment of the schemes. Here, I must confess that I have grave misgivings as to whether we have yet learnt adequately to assess whether a scheme is really working well or not. I have great regard and respect for the staff of the MSC. But it is just not possible for the kind of people who are employed in the MSC to give informed judgments about the quality of training going on in a whole variety of different schemes in different industries. I have myself been muddled up with training over a large number of years, but I would not consider myself competent to estimate the quality of a training scheme in industries with which I have no familiarity whatever. Of course, when the MSC staff go round to do their assessment of training, because they are assessing financial competence and the conformity to financial requirements of the people running the scheme as well as the quality of the training, they tend inevitably to judge the schemes on their administrative and financial correctness, rather than on the real quality of training that is going on. That simply will not do as a way of deciding whether schemes are reaching the quality required.<lb/>
Indeed, some research and interesting work done by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations very much pointed out that learning often goes on best in some of the most administratively untidy schemes. There is no necessary correlation between the schemes in which all the forms are filled up and the bills paid regularly and the learning achievements of the people in the schemes. It is much more difficult to estimate what is going on in terms of learning achievements than it is to judge what is going on in terms of administrative tidiness. I welcome the development of project review teams in which the different parties to the
<col>72</col>
training programme are getting together in a self-critical way with mutual help to try to improve standards. An inspectorial approach is not a helpful one at this stage when we are all trying to learn together.<lb/>
I also think that we need every possible way of calling on the help of people who really are expert in the training field. I must say that when I sat on this committee, I was horrified to hear one representative&#x2014;I think it was of the MSC&#x2014;say, in talking about training, that there were no experts in this field. Perhaps I misheard. I think that it will be found in the record. There are in this country people inside companies and in the training boards, and who have left the training boards, who have a very high degree of expertise in the training field. We need to tap all that skill so far as we possibly can.<lb/>
Training diversity and quality are the two themes about which I wished to talk. There is, however, one remaining theme on which I should like briefly to touch. The report and, of course, the MSC are committed to equal opportunities. It so happens that by this morning's post I received as, no doubt, did many of your Lordships, a report from Bristol University on ethnic minorities and the youth training scheme. I have not studied it in detail. But it is clear, as most of us would expect, that in some schemes at any rate members of ethnic minorities are getting a pretty raw deal. I do not suppose that in many cases this is deliberate. It happens in so many different ways.<lb/>
I would simply say that it must be a high priority to see that members of ethnic minorities get full benefit from the youth training scheme. This will not happen unless firms and organisations employing them have well thought out and positive programmes for the promotion of equal opportunities. I say programmes and not policies. For my part, I could manage without policies. They are so often a fig-leaf for disguising the fact that nothing much is going on. But a detailed programme of what one is trying to achieve in terms of the employment and training of members of ethnic minorities, properly monitored to see that it happens, is the only way that the criticisms raised in this report can be met and the MSC's objective of equal opportunities can be achieved.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00549"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this report is about matters of far reaching economic social and political significance for the EEC and for this country. Its subject matter is closely connected, as the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, has said, with the anxiety that is at the very top of public consciousness at the present time&#x2014;anxiety as to what can be done to provide what seems to be, in this and in a number of other countries in Europe, a missing link in our national stategy. It is the link between, on the one hand, the vital containment of inflation and increasing of competitiveness, and. on the other hand, the reduction of unemployment through the generation of more jobs. This missing link was discussed, as the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, said, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on television over the weekend. My right honourable friend certainly did not brush aside the fact that unemployment is thoroughly bad&#x2014;bad for those that are unemployed for long periods, divisive,
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0045"/>
<col>73</col>
expensive and bad for competitiveness. He did say that if there was a lever to pull, he would pull it. The trouble was knowing what that lever was.<lb/>
This anxiety that exists at the present time is part of an anxiety of a more general kind. People are looking from the EEC and from their own government, for a lead. They know that the old economic ways of the 1960s and the 1970s do not work any more&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy would say with the possible exception of the MSC. They are looking for a new sense of direction, for positive goals, for shared understanding of what the future might look like and how we might prepare for it. That desire, naturally, has particularly focused on the way that we should be equipping our young people to ensure that they can play their part in the future and to ensure that there is a part for them to play. Vocational education and training and particularly youth training could provide a major ingredient in this new sense of direction, this new hope, that is so ardently sought. So neither the Community as a whole nor any of its member states would be wise to ignore the kind of things that our committee is saying.<lb/>
I want to speak very briefly on the messages that the report contains for the British Government. I am of course encouraged in so doing by the contribution on behalf of the Government made by my noble friend Lord Young of Graffham, under whose skilled chairmanship of the MSC I, too, have had the privilege of serving. It seems to me that there are at least four major reasons why my noble friend and the Government should take heed of this report and why they could and should take action beyond the considerable amount they are doing already, broadly on the lines the committee proposes.<lb/>
The four reasons are these. There is increasingly hard and convincing evidence that, for developed countries, economic success comes best when national strategy is underpinned by strong, long-term commitment to vocational educational and training. This fact is borne out by the Select Committee report, by its comparisons between the systems of European countries, by the statistics and by a number of expert submissions made to the committee. It is rammed home even more forcibly by another report produced for NEDO and the MSC by the Institute of Manpower Studies and published during the summer. That report examines the situation in three countries&#x2014;the USA, Japan and western Germany; their attitudes to and systems of vocational education and training; their level of investment in these things; who pays and why; and how the various parties concerned see their role and responsibilities. It also looks at how all this has affected, very much for the better, those countries' economic performance, flexibility in response to recession, ability to an extent to fend off unemployment.<lb/>
For us in Britain, all these facts make challenging reading. As my noble friend Lord Young has said, we have made a start in the right direction, but we have a very long way indeed to go in the changes of attitude that are required. The employers in this country are mostly still a long way from seeing their role in education and training as competitor employers see theirs&#x2014;that, to get training right in quality and
<col>74</col>
quantity, employers should take the major part and that this is well worth their while.<lb/>
Some trades unions, at any rate in local areas, are still some way from seeing their role as the positive supportive one adopted by their colleagues in competitor countries. Likewise the educators and their employers, taxpayers and ratepayers, are not yet fully convinced; and right through the system in this country&#x2014;some of the evidence to the Select Committee reflected this&#x2014;there are people in positions of influence in various organisations who can help us all to move on but who still respond to this challenge at the level of small-time political point scoring and defence of vested interest in the <i>status quo</i>. With the evidence there is that far stronger long-term commitment to vocational education and training is not only desirable but essential, the Government have a big responsibility to give a lead in changing attitudes, in getting willingness to re-direct energy and shift resources.<lb/>
The second reason the Government must act&#x2014;as my noble friend on the Front Bench has said, a beginning has been made by the forming of the new group&#x2014;is that it is clear from this report that education and training must come together. The Policy Studies Institute put this really well in their evidence to the committee, and I quote from page 147 of the report:
<quote>"Education is not separable from training. Education develops basic qualities, skills and knowledge which enable specific skills to be acquired speedily and with real understanding. Being trained for today's jobs is not as important as being trainable to do the unknown jobs of the future.&#x2026; Education and training should be seen as a community effort in which employers and parents have not only an interest but a major contribution to make".</quote>
This view was endorsed by the memorandum submitted by the Society of Education Officers, who spelt out in some detail&#x2014;and very helpfully&#x2014;the educational implications of this kind of change.<lb/>
Because this coming together involves many people who are used to working separately from one another&#x2014;not just different Government departments under different Ministers but professionals of different disciplines working in both public and private sectors, and local authorities of various political persuasions&#x2014;the only way is for the Government to give a strong, convincing lead&#x2014;a lead which I believe is now desired by all concerned, including all but the least enlightened professionals.<lb/>
The third reason why the Government should act now is that people are, without question, confused by the system which has already been discussed and are asking for arrangements that are not only easier to understand but are fairer, and if possible enable every young person to get some qualification which is of interest to an employer. This desire happens to coincide with the beginning of much-needed curriculum changes in schools, with great interest in TVEI, in the 16-plus Action Plan in Scotland, with increasing appreciation of the potential of the YTS year as its quality and objectives develop, its potentialities for young people, for colleges and other training agencies, and for employers. It also coincides with the virtual collapse of the old-type apprenticeship, making space now for new, more flexible ways into occupational training, for the possibility of a follow-up year to YTS
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0046"/>
<col>75</col>
with a qualification as the aim, and the adult training and re-training strategy now being developed and mentioned by my noble friend. The time seems ripe now for that more coherent system that everyone can understand. That must be the subject of Government action.<lb/>
The fourth reason why the Government should act is the corollary to that last one&#x2014;the need now for rationalisation of the status and the financial arrangements for 16- to 18-year-olds. To harness young people's enthusiasm; to encourage them to choose a route which is right for them in the longer term rather than producing more money in the short term; to reflect the fact that they are moving into adulthood, want to have their own money, be responsible for contributing for board and lodging, for saving, for buying sensibly, and that this is true whether one is at school, at college, in training, or wherever; to reflect the fact that all are on the way to one sort of qualification and, of necessity, learners for a while, some kind of shared status for all seems the best way, all 16- to 18-year-olds being students or trainees with an allowance rather than a wage but an allowance paid to them and not to their parent.<lb/>
To conclude, the political imperative in this country as well as all over Europe is a new lead, a new sense of direction especially in relation to our young people. It seems to me that there are at least four good reasons emerging from this report why the type of policies which are proposed should be very seriously considered by the Government, and with all speed. Next year is International Youth Year. Perhaps 1985 is the year for further action. I commend the report to my noble friend and your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00551"><member>Baroness Serota</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a Member of Sub-Committee C I must first express my warmest thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, for the skill, patience and courtesy with which he steered the subcommittee through the masses of both written and oral evidence on all our deliberations which resulted in the presentation of this report this evening. The noble Lord has presented it in his typically clear and concise manner which all of us can only admire. I have of course known the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, for nearly 20 years. We first met to undertake the inquiry into the local authority and allied personal social services. His skills of chairmanship are always a pleasure to those of us who serve with him on Sub-Committee C. Indeed, the whole House owes him a debt of gratitude not only for the particular report that we are considering tonight, but for all those that have been issued under his chairmanship of Sub-Committee C on education, employment and social policy in the EEC in the years that he has chaired the committee.<lb/>
I, too, would wish to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, on his elevation to this House, to the Cabinet and of course tonight on his ministerial maiden speech&#x2014;a daunting triple, if I may say so&#x2014;and I also wish him every happiness and success as regards the arduous new responsibilities that he has so recently undertaken. I was glad to note in his
<col>76</col>
speech that he recognised that the prospects of employment for young people without marketable knowledge and skills are declining rapidly in all the industrially advanced nations. The noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, quoted to us the stark figures which are set out in Part 3 of the report comparing the spread of training in this country with the younger generation in Western Germany. I shall not delay the House at this late hour by repeating the figures. They were also touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Young.<lb/>
But looking further afield and clearly expressed in the report which the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy has just mentioned, are the figures relating not only to West Germany but also to Japan and the United States. It is quite clear from the report of the Institute of Manpower Studies which was prepared for the National Economic Development Council and the Manpower Services Commission recently, that in Japan 96 per cent. of 16- to 18-year-olds are still at school in the broadest sense of the term. The figure for West Germany is 86 per cent. Unfortunately the figure for the United Kingdom is only 52 per cent., which would rise to 60 per cent. if the school-based portions of the MSC's youth programme were included.<lb/>
I was delighted to hear from the noble Lord the Minister that he too agreed that deficiences are in our system and not in our young. The system is fragmented, and to many quite incomprehensible. In spite of the numerous inquiries stemming way back to the Crowther Report in 1959, which some noble Lords will remember only too well, our existing system of education and training for young people, particularly in the 16 to 18 age range is fragmented and as the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, said at the outset of this debate, there is an urgent need to bring together the education and training system for all our young people&#x2014;and we stress in the report "all our young people"&#x2014;within a coherent and comprehensive framework. The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, seemed to have doubts about this, but having heard the evidence that came before the sub-committee and the discussions that we held together as Members, I personally have little doubt that the system is extremely difficult for young people to understand and comprehend. Sometimes it seems that it is merely chance which determines which way they go in or out of the system as it presents itself in the local areas in which they live.<lb/>
The four key problems which we identified in the report&#x2014;social and material status; the quality of education provided; assessment and certification; and finally careers advice and guidance&#x2014;have already been dealt with so ably by the noble Lords who have preceded me that I feel that all I need say at this stage of the debate is that I personally attach the greatest importance to the first of those recommendations; namely, that relating to common status, so that young people can proceed through their different paths with equality of status, but perhaps to different goals. I wish to stress to the House that until this particular aspect of our training system is accepted and incorporated we shall still have the inequalities of opportunity that so many of us regret in the present set-up.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, and I think also the noble Lord, Lord Young, touched briefly on those parts of the report that dealt with the needs of ethnic
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0047"/>
<col>77</col>
minorities, the socially disadvantaged, the handicapped and the disabled. I should like to draw the attention of the House particularly this evening to paragraph 82 where the Committee attempted to set out what it saw as the future policy for these particular groups. They may be minority groups but added together they add up to a substantial minority of our young people who do require special help through recognition, within the wider context of a universal training system, of their special needs. They need perhaps a more flexible age entry on training schemes, more time as regards the period of study, particularly for those who have spent long periods of their lives in hospital, and some of them need different learning situations. For example, under the NACRO youth opportunities programme one in four of their trainees were aged 18 or over. But when these programmes were translated into youth training schemes last year, NACRO could no longer offer its employment training to the immature, older adolescent without any substantial employment experience who might have spent time in residential care or custody but who was beginning to look for help with re-settlement in the community.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, will know more about this than I, but I understand that the MSC supported NACRO's proposal for some flexibility in the criterion of eligibility for youth training schemes particularly to include this relatively small number of young people&#x2014;I believe some 2,000 altogether&#x2014;who had been in custody at the age of 16 or 17 and who had missed the opportunity of a full year on YTS. Unfortunately, this proposal was rejected by Ministers and I only hope that now that the noble Lord, Lord Young, has been translated&#x2014;or perhaps I should say has suffered a sea-change&#x2014;he will, as Minister with his particular responsibility, look favourably upon flexibility of age entry to particular disadvantaged groups.<lb/>
Similarly, the decision of the Grovernment to reduce the number of places on YTS Mode B community-based projects, which are provided by voluntary organisations for handicapped and disadvantaged young people, reducing them from 90,000 to some 71,000, with the corresponding loss of the special experience and skills of the staff involved in these training schemes, has been widely deplored on all sides. Once again I would plead with the noble Lord the Minister to persuade the Government to restore these most unfortunate and short-sighted cuts and ensure that future training, policy and practice take account of young people with special needs such as these.<lb/>
It would perhaps be wrong to conclude my brief intervention this evening without recognising that the implementation of the recommendation of the report of the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, would require increased expenditure by Government, employers and individuals. But I hope that after this debate the House and the Government, which I also hope will study this debate and report in detail, will agree in the light of the evidence and the arguments adduced in the report that merely to improve existing schemes and initiatives is not enough, and that there can surely be no better investment for this country to make at this moment of time than investment in what after all is our greatest,
<col>78</col>
our most vital resource&#x2014;namely, the present and future generations of young people in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00552">7.31 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00553"><member>Baroness Vickers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, first, may I offer my congratulations to my noble friend Lord Young of Graffham. I hope that he has brought a magic wand with him because that is very much what this subject needs. I should also like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, for the very kind way in which he always runs the committee and also for helping with the report. I should like to thank the clerks and the advisers who have produced this very remarkable report.<lb/>
I found it very useful to meet those dealing with the youth training systems in the various countries of the EEC and to note that the problem is a difficult one in all the countries of the Community. Most of the points that I wanted to raise have been touched on, but I want to mention two particular matters; namely, careers officers and rural areas, which I do not think have so far been mentioned.<lb/>
In my view careers officers are very important. I believe that it is very unfortunate that the Employment and Training Act 1973 has not been implemented by the Government, because I understand that this Act lays the responsibility on the local authorities to provide vocational guidance. At present there are plenty of teachers who need work, and it would be advisable if they could be properly trained as careers teachers. I understand that at present written statements are sent to young people containing careers advice, but that is not very helpful. Those statements may or may not be read. They may also not be the right type for the individual concerned.<lb/>
I gather that a total documentation system which could start in the schools would be preferred. I believe that at present there are only about 3,000 fully trained careers teachers and about 500 untrained ones. I understand that Sir Keith Joseph and the DES think that profiling should take place in the schools. I hope that consideration will be given to encouraging young people to be self-employed. There are plenty of jobs at which they can be self-employed and which very badly need doing. I have in mind chimney sweeping, window cleaning, thatching, jobbing gardening, and so on. All these jobs are quite well paid and are very necessary to the community. But people seem to think that they are not grand enough. Therefore, I suggest that these jobs should be upgraded and put into special categories. I could give a number of other examples which would make very useful careers.<lb/>
Careers education should be an integral part of general education and should start at about the age of 12. When people have to do jobs which they do not like there are many failures and therefore they leave within a short time. I was interested in what the report had to say about vocational training in France. There the Ministry of Education has a dominant role to play, which I think is very useful. It divides its programmes for apprentices in particular between the ages of 16 and 18, and 18 and 21. About 40 per cent. under the age of 25 are still unemployed, but they have a very good apprenticeship scheme in building and construction work and I gather that there are about 40,000
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0048"/>
<col>79</col>
apprentices in that scheme. They also pay well&#x2014;about &#x00A3;47 or &#x00A3;48 a month&#x2014;and they give proper certificates. They give vocational certificates and apprentices certificates, which are very useful for young people to have.<lb/>
Careers officers need better training and it is well worthwhile the Government spending money on giving them training. So often one goes into a school and sees a notice board displaying all the jobs open to these young people, but the subjects are never spoken about; the young people are just given the papers. I suggest that real training would be one way in which to get more people into employment.<lb/>
I should like to say a few words about the rural areas. In Germany they have very good agricultural day schools and residential ones. The latter seems to be a good idea because distances in rural areas are often very great and this makes it difficult for young people to attend day centres. Schemes in these areas are often difficult to run. For example, a scheme run in a rural area is based on urban allowances. I believe that they should have a different allowance because of the travelling involved. I have been told by the coordinators of some of these schemes (and I have visited them) that 55 per cent. of a co-ordinator's operating costs and allowances have to be spent on travel. So there is very little left for tools and equipment, which have to be restricted to the bare essentials. Train fares also give rise to difficulties and some trainees bring their own vehicles, which takes up a lot of their money. Although they are reimbursed for any expenditure they incur over &#x00A3;3, it is felt that a trainee in a rural area needs &#x00A3;35 a week.<lb/>
Another difficulty is the small numbers in some training centres. This is due to the health and safety requirements for specified working space per individual. Town-based project teams for the rural areas each comprise a supervisor and four trainees and supervisors have difficulty in going to the rural areas, and have to provide their own transport. However, one of the areas I visited was quite successful.<lb/>
Perhaps I may give a few figures. They span the period from 1st April 1983 to September 1984. Between those dates their plans for practical work experience was associated with off-the-job training and during the same period 208 young people left the scheme. Of that total, 85 obtained permanent employment, 43 of whom were girls and 42 of whom were boys The remainder left for a variety of reasons. Twenty-three and a half per cent. had completed their allotted period of time; 7 per cent. were dismissed and 19 per cent. resigned for personal or health reasons; and 1 per cent. went to college.<lb/>
I believe that that gives an idea of what can be done in rural areas with the different types of young people today. Some have been very successful in obtaining jobs in, for instance, stables. I visited some who were learning to be grooms. This was very popular with the girls. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience when I allowed part of my garden to be used by six young people to grow vegetables. I took no notice of these young people until they were leaving because I did not think that it was my business. But when I asked them why they were leaving they said that they did not like
<col>80</col>
gardening and that there was no future for them. When I told them that they could earn about &#x00A3;3 an hour cutting grass they were rather astonished, but I do not think that they changed their minds.<lb/>
In conclusion, I should like help on one particular point. Can my noble friend ask the Government not to cut the trainees, for instance, in the Royal Dockyards? The Royal Dockyards have always been a large training centre.<lb/>
They have always trained more people than they need, both girls and boys, with the object of giving them proper training. They have plenty of room to do so, and the trainees go off and get jobs in other places. If this is going to be cut, as we have been told, it will be detrimental to the areas concerned. If the noble Lord could do this little job and persuade the Government not to cut them while there are plenty of applications for the engineering jobs, it would be helpful; and I should like to thank him now for listening and taking some notes.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00555"><member>Baroness Lockwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to welcome the report of the Select Committee on Youth Training in the EEC. I welcome it for setting out the problems and experience of the different European countries and also for the important and coherent conclusions it reaches. Before commenting on the conclusions, however, I should like to underline how important it is for us in this country to understand the different attitudes to training in different countries.<lb/>
This report refers to Europe. Other reports have gone wider, and already this evening the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, and my noble friend Lady Serota have referred to the NEDO and MSC Report on training and education in Germany, the United States, and Japan. As Geoffrey Holland, the Director of the Manpower Services Commission, has stressed, it is clear beyond any doubt that the United Kingdom's lack of competitiveness, and thus its economic problems, derive to a large extent from our failure to invest in training to the same extent as some of our competitors have done.<lb/>
The Select Committee comment in their introduction in paragraph 9:
<quote>"Lack of training is not, in itself, the main cause of youth unemployment".</quote>
They go on to say:
<quote>"there is evidence that a more highly-trained workforce generates wealth and helps create jobs".</quote>
This is something that Japan would certainly subscribe to not only in the training of the young but also in adult training and life training, on which they place so much importance. Within Europe itself Germany would certainly subscribe to it, and, as has already been said, is investing more in training than we are in this country.<lb/>
The evidence to the Select Committee showed that the Germans believe that their competitiveness depends on a well-trained workforce. Even in a recession German industry is prepared to continue to pay for it and continue to invest in training. Therefore, the fear of the Select Committee that we are in danger of falling even further behind in industrial skills and competence cannot be ignored even in the context of
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0049"/>
<col>81</col>
the British programme, as had been outlined by the noble Lord the Minister, Lord Young. Here I too should like to congratulate him on his maiden speech, and welcome him to this House.<lb/>
If we look at the figures which have already been referred to, the report points out that only a third of the German workforce is unqualified compared with two-thirds of our workforce. This is already. But if we add to that the fact that only about 5 per cent. of young Germans leave school without going into further education or training, then we see that it is absolutely vital that we move quickly.<lb/>
I would say, and I have said this before, that the YTS is a good beginning, but we must build upon it. Paragraph 129 of the Select Committee's report says:
<quote>"Every young person should have the opportunity of a training programme lasting at least one year after the YTS foundation year."</quote>
This is the minimum that we should aim for. That paragraph goes on to say:
<quote>"Wherever possible, this further training should lead to a recognised occupational qualification."</quote>
This paragraph raises the whole problem of the kind of training that should be provided. Much has been said on this, in particular by the noble Baroness, Lady Seear.<lb/>
I am concerned that we should continue with the broad-based training that YTS has initiated. This was an experiment in training in this country. It is too early for us to say that we should now move over to more occupationally biased training, because again as has been said this evening there are many skills and occupations which we are going to have to train for in the future which we do not yet know of. Consequently it is important that we should provide in this first year a broad-based training which can then be built on in a more specialised way, perhaps then moving on to a more occupationally oriented kind of training. If it is clearly seen to be the case that the basic first year's training is going to lead to other training which in the end will build up skills which are marketable, then I think that young people will be prepared to accept not only the on-the-job training but the off-the-job training element too.<lb/>
One of the difficulties that has been seen with YTS in this first year is that it is the scheme of last resort; a scheme for those who could not get jobs. Therefore, those who have gone on to the scheme have had the option of dropping out as soon as a paid job appeared, irrespective of whether the paid job really led to a proper career in the future. If our youth training scheme is to be of value to industry and of value to the individuals themselves, it must be seen as the first part of a continuous process in training.<lb/>
It is because of this that I welcome paragraph 128 of the Select Committee's report, which talks about the urgent need to bring together the education and employment of young people into a coherent framework which can be understood by employers, parents, and educators. The noble Lord, Lord Young, referred to this. My noble friend Lord McCarthy referred to it, but he seemed to have some reservations about it. I think it is to be welcomed because there is a problem about recognising the routes which are available to young people. It is impossible, as the PSI evidence suggested, to divorce the educational element
<col>82</col>
from the training element. Therefore, we have to take the two together, education and training, as an inseparable part of the lives of the young 16- to 18-year-olds.<lb/>
I would say that even those who are studying A-levels with an eye to university entrance are also concerned with their future because they are concerned with the kinds of career or profession that a university education will provide for them. It is essential that we should see those two clearly linked together.<lb/>
I must say that I have slight reservations about this question of linking the two, particularly when one takes it back to the 14-year-olds. I was somewhat concerned to see in the <i>Times Educational Supplement</i> of 12th October that the MSC is drawing up a plan of action to start vocational education at 14. It depends what is meant by "vocational education". If this means educating young people in the broader aspects of industry and what prospects there are, then I am all for it. If it is a question of introducing young people to technology I am all for that; but I do not think that at this point in a young person's educational career we should be training them or seeking to train them for a specific job. After all, in education we are currently debating seriously the widening of the curriculum for young people and so we do not want to narrow it at one end when we are thinking in terms of vocational training.<lb/>
I welcome the committee's underlying recommendation that we need a strategy for both education and training. When I heard of the Minister's appointment I was not quite sure whether it was a step forward or a step backwards. As chairman of the MSC he had been able to initiate many things. I wondered what he would be able to do, as a Minister Without Portfolio. However, he tells us that his first task is to chair a committee which is co-ordinating the input of the 16-to 18-year-olds from four departments. I hope the emphasis will be on co-ordination because the German experience and evidence has shown that if a structure is to be successful it needs close cooperation&#x2014;in the case of Germany from the federal and l&#x00E4;nder governments, trade unions and employers, and in this country from the Government, the LEAs, trade unions and employers. It seems that the relationship with the local education authorities is one that needs to be considered very carefully so that there can be co-ordination and goodwill on both sides.<lb/>
The committee report accepts inevitably that an improved and extended system of training needs more money. The MSC has recognised this too, so therefore in this debate we must ask whether the Government also accept it? The recommendation of the committee at paragraph 132, and more fully at paragraphs 92 and 94, endorses a common status and allowance for young people. Here there will be a cost consequence, but I hope that it will be clearly grasped by the Government.<lb/>
Part of our problem is the divisive nature of society in this country and a common status for young people would help to overcome this; a common status, as the report says, which would give young people the choice of route for that individual's development according to his or her aptitude and preference.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0050"/>
<col>83</col>
This one step in itself could do much to unify the system. Despite the reservations that my noble friend Lord McCarthy had on the type of allowance it would be, it is, nevertheless, a principle that has long been advocated from these Benches.<lb/>
My final point refers to paragraph 130&#x2014;special help to the disadvantaged. As the House would expect, my concern is with the opportunities for girls and women. Again the committee recognises this problem and it says that the lack of opportunity for girls to move into the occupations traditionally regarded as male is unfair and a waste of potential. But like the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, I think this is much more than just a recognition of the principle. It is a systematic attack on the principle and the attack must be made not just at national level but at local level, too.<lb/>
When we consider the other programmes that we have experienced so far&#x2014;the youth opportunities programme as well as the youth training scheme, the Community programme and even TVEI where the principle of equality is firmly stated in the objectives&#x2014;we have still not come to terms with this problem of training and breaking down the different opportunities for girls and boys. I feel that at all levels within the system we need a recognition of the problem and, as Lady Seear said, programmes to remove the inequality. For this reason, as well as others, I also support very much that conclusion of the committee concerned with career guidance and the need for better training for both teachers and the trainers. Any integrated strategy for education and training based on common standards must, by definition, be concerned with this problem as well. For all the reasons I have outlined, the report is very much to be welcomed and I hope that the Government will act upon it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00556">7.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00557"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are all grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, for this excellent report and we also have been privileged to listen to the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham. I am not worried about his lack of portfolio because I think it is probably exactly what is required to cover the span of activities which need to be drawn together, and we are fortunate to have him in this House.<lb/>
There are two aspects of the committee's report on which I want to concentrate. The first is concerned with our own YTS and in particular the Mode B branch of that scheme. In paragraph 82 the committee says that:
<quote>"Special help must be given to ethnic minorities, to under-achievers and to the disabled".</quote>
I do not want to quote much more of that because it has already been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Serota. The crucial sentence is as follows:
<quote>"The Committee regret that YTS Mode B appears in certain parts of the country to have been much reduced".</quote>
When one turns to the evidence one finds in Questions 150 and 151 the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, and my noble friend Lady Seear pressing Mr. Mansell of the Further Education Unit on this point. He admits, on page 127, that:
<col>84</col>
<quote>"There is some resentment, within the further education system, that these young people are not going into Mode A (the employer-based YTS schemes), and that the further education system is being used, some say, as a dumping ground for these young people".</quote>
He goes on to say:
<quote>"I would not agree with that term: I think it is a proper role for the further education system to do that".</quote>
I applaud his sentiments because it is generally accepted that the education service has not succeeded with the bottom 40 per cent. of compulsory school-leavers, and it would be highly creditable to the FE system if it were to make the <i>amende honorable</i> on the lines suggested by my noble friend Lady Seear. Mr. Mansell says later:
<quote>"When we hear that the Manpower Services Commission because of the low take-up of Mode A are thinking of reducing Mode B that does not actually augur very well for this group of young people we are now talking about".</quote>
My Lords, this is very serious, and whether Mode B cuts out an ideological spasm, as the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, says, or whether it does not, it means that many of those who were not well-served during the compulsory stage of education are going to receive a further rejection under the YTS. The Government, I would suggest to the noble Lord, ought to think again here if they do not want to build up mounting trouble and resentment in future. By the end of March 1984, according to my figures, and the end of YTS year one, the MSC had closed 49 community projects and five training workshops, a total of 2,460 places. A further 17,500 community-based places were lost simply by reducing the size of the remaining schemes. The new slim-line Mode B(1) started in 1984&#x2013;85 with 70,000 places&#x2014;a reduction of nearly 20,000. The Government have always advanced low take-up as the reason for this reduction, but do the facts bear them out? I suggest not. The latest figures for occupancy available to me, at any rate, were to the end of August. They were as follows. Mode A (that is, the employer-based schemes) 202,679, representing only a 62 per cent. take-up; Mode B(1), 64,389, representing a 92 per cent. take-up. Given the fact that there is always some leakage through changes to another scheme or entry into the labour market, or simply dropping out, Mode B(1) turns out to be virtually fully subscribed.<lb/>
The 1984&#x2013;85 plan, I understand, called for 390,000 entrants. We have been told that there are now some 300,000 in place. If the remaining 90,000 come forward, they have little choice but to try for an employer-based scheme, for which many may be unsuitable and may be rejected. There is also the regional dimension. If there appear to be 6,000 places still going begging on B(1), they are almost certainly to be in London or the south. The National Council for Voluntary Services tell me that they know of many Mode B schemes in the northern regions&#x2014;the regions with the greatest industrial devastation&#x2014;which have lengthy waiting lists. I therefore want to ask the noble Lord if the Government will not consider restoring the B(1) schemes to, say, for the sake of argument, 90,000 places. If they do not, they will severely damage the credibility of their promise of a suitable training opportunity for all unemployed school-leavers. That includes the ethnic minorities, the disabled and the low achievers.<lb/>
I turn to another aspect of the committee's report which particularly interests me, and that is the social
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0051"/>
<col>85</col>
and material status of young people beyond the compulsory school-leaving age and prior to immersion in the labour market. In paragraph 92 the committee recommend their common status approach for all 16 and 17 year-olds with the same basic allowance, irrespective of their particular chosen route. One immediate advantage of this&#x2014;anyway, advocated by the Institute of Personnel Management&#x2014;would be to prevent a young person taking a decision about his or her future based primarily on financial considerations, by which I understand immediate financial considerations are the differences between supplementary benefit, YTS allowances and staying on at school and so on.<lb/>
The Government are committed to choice. I should have thought that it might appeal to them that the choices between various parts should be genuine choices; that is, financially neutral. This neutrality should ideally extend to those wishing to continue in full-time education whose parents at present continue to receive child benefit till their 19th birthday. Many poorer families will want to trade in child benefit for a higher allowance of supplementary benefit, which makes a far greater contribution to the family budget. Also, child benefit paid to mum is hardly likely to accord with the aspirations of young people over 16 to independent status and income.<lb/>
We should not be surprised by these aspirations, or indignant at them. We have, after all, created the high-consumption society from which they spring. These aspirations will not go away, but, obviously, there are cost implications. As regards educational maintenance allowances, my party has advanced the idea of an education benefit at 16-plus, half of which would be initially assessable for tax against the parents' income. This would go some way towards equalising the choices and might, incidentally, reduce pressure on the more expensive YTS. This is a field to which more attention needs to be devoted. The committee deserve our thanks for again having brought the issue to the surface, as we did at the unemployment committee three years ago. Lord McCarthy is correct in saying that on that committee we suggested a more complicated system which I then supported. I am not sure that I do not prefer the greater simplicity of this approach. Until we get this right and make it fair, there will be a high level of disaffection among the young.<lb/>
I have two final points, my Lords. Looking through the evidence one is struck by the number of advocates of a two-year YTS. The committee say in paragraph 102:
<quote>"every young person should have the opportunity of a training programme lasting at least one year after the YTS foundation year."</quote>
I, myself, do not believe that anybody should be fully in the labour market before 18. That is my quarrel with the young workers' scheme, which, as far as I know, contains little or no training element at all. The noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, suggests that this scheme should be converted into a second year of training; and I think that I agree with him on this. On the cost side, there has undoubtedly been a lower take-up across the whole scheme than the 460,000 originally envisaged. Would the noble Lord not agree that this gives the Government some leeway for progress towards a second year? Could he tell us how much the
<col>86</col>
Government had earmarked for 1984&#x2013;85, and if there is an undershoot, as seems probable on present trends, whether they will apply this money to improve or extend the scheme?<lb/>
My last point is this. The committee say in paragraph 78:
<quote>"The variety of approach in the United Kingdom represents a richness. But a more coherent and easily understandable set of provisions need not be any less rich."</quote>
In paragraph 84 they say:
<quote>"there is an urgent need to bring together the whole education, training and employment of young people in a coherent framework which can be understood by employers, parents, educators, trainees, and, above all, by the young people themselves."</quote>
I do not quite know why the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, objects to this. You do not have to be an advocate of a vast institutional shake-up to want to understand what is on offer. I think I rather tend to agree more with the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, over that. The committee repeat this recommendation in paragraph 128 of the conclusions. Given the pluralism and variety of our system, I see it as one of the most important recommendations.<lb/>
As far as I know, neither the career service nor anyone else has produced a comprehensive and comprehensible chart of the options open to young people and their possible interconnections. By that, I mean where you can change trains, so to speak, without losing the portmanteau of credits accumulated from the previous course or courses. I think that the noble Lord gave us some hope that something of this sort might emerge from the interdepartmental committee that he is to chair. I wonder whether that is a correct interpretation of his remarks, and, if so, whether whatever is produced will be widely disseminated. I also very much hope that the DHSS is going to be involved, because some of its regulations are well-nigh incomprehensible.<lb/>
I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Young, will take my queries and suggestions in the constructive spirit in which they are made. We applaud the Government for having recognised the need for a proper training scheme in this country and for having laid the foundations, but there is still an awful lot of building to be done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00558">8.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00559"><member>Lord Young of Graffham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I start by saying that I now appreciate the reason for the reputation this House has for its debates. I have found the comments made today to be very instructive and thoughtful. I have learned a great deal and I certainly thank the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, for his welcome to me on my first module of 'on the job' training, and I hope he will mark my performance afterwards.<lb/>
Perhaps I may put the record straight by immediately paying tribute to the trade unions for their work within the Manpower Services Commission and in particular for their part in the launching of the youth training scheme. Of course, not only the unions, but also employers, local authorities and all the parties are involved. This truly is a scheme which could not have been launched without the greatest co-operation of all concerned. If I had any particular regret during
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0052"/>
<col>87</col>
my period at the MSC, it was really in regard to those organisations which almost made a profession out of criticising or undermining the confidence of young people within the youth training scheme.<lb/>
The noble Lord referred to the report by Youth Aid on Mode B (1) training under the youth training scheme. One of the organisations and some parts of the report I regretted. But perhaps I may say once more, in relation to the provisions of Mode B (1) places, that although in the very first year of the youth training scheme we had provision for 90,000 places, at no time during that year were more than 55,000 places ever filled. Therefore we have been spending money on 35,000 places which were never utilised. The difference between Mode B (1) and other modes is that the Manpower Services Commission were paying for unfilled places and no less than &#x00A3;70 million that should have gone to the training of young people went to the employment of trainers. When Ministers reduced the number to 71,500 that still left a considerable surplus over the 55,000 places filled. We were responding to much more than an ideological spasm in the market. But I hope very much, as we see today with 65,000 places filled and provision still for 71,500, there will be adequate and suitable provision for all those who will benefit from Mode B (1) training. Ministers have assured the commission and all those interested parties, such as the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Association of County Councils, that, should the need be there for more places, they will sanction the funding of them. That understanding still applies today.<lb/>
I should like also to assure the noble Lord that within the Manpower Services Commission we recommended that the young workers scheme be modified so that it should follow on from a year on the youth training scheme. Ministers accepted the recommendation, and today it is a follow-on scheme. So already we have the embryo, if you like, of a two-vear scheme: young people can stay for one year and then, if they so wish, their employers can apply the benefit of the youth training scheme, their employers get a subsidy, and continue the young people's employment for a second year. I suspect there will be very few young people who will not carry on in employment for the second year.<lb/>
Finally, perhaps I may comment very briefly on the noble Lord's remarks about my future role. Of course it is only the private sector that actually creates jobs that last, but that does not mean that there is not much that could be done in reducing some of the barriers which Governments themselves have produced over the years to stop the creation of new employment.<lb/>
May I next thank the noble Baroness, Lady Seear, for her remarks and pay tribute to her skill as the chairman of one of our area manpower boards? I should like to say that I agree with her totally on the need for diversity. There cannot be fixed standards, but there must be a degree of comparability within the various youth training schemes up and down the country. The one thing we must not do is to have too much rigidity in standards, because tomorrow's world, the world of employment, at the moment is very uncertain. We have to set the trainers free, to allow
<col>88</col>
them scope for imagination so as to provide the kind of training which they can see will be required tomorrow.<lb/>
But throughout all this we have to ensure that whatever else happens, the quality of the youth training scheme is paramount. If we do not get the quality, then the scheme itself will fail. This year it is the sole aim of the Manpower Services Commission to improve the quality. It was for this reason that the Youth Training Board decided that they did not wish to change the scheme in any particular, save to make it better.<lb/>
I would say to those, including those organisations which tend almost to make a profession out of criticising the scheme, that they should perhaps take into account that compulsory education is 100 years old in this country and it is by no means necessarily perfect; the youth training scheme is but one year old. I hope that by the time the youth training scheme approaches a tenth of the age of compulsory education it will have a very high standard and at least will satisfy noble Lords opposite as to its quality.<lb/>
Of course, there is a great deal to be done to bring industry into schools. In fact, I regret that in the debates which took place some 20 years ago when we were so concerned with the structure of education in this country&#x2014;the debates that led to the comprehensives&#x2014;we did not at that time give more thought to the content of education. Somehow during that very process we managed to eliminate whatever vestiges of technical education we had.<lb/>
I recall, a year or 18 months ago, at a seminar which the Prime Minister called on the subject of innovation, an industrialist making an impassioned speech asking why, why, had we taken all the men and women who would have been good foremen and turned them into indifferent sociologists? If we were to look at what we actually did to ourselves during that period, I think we would accept today that we have considerable cause for regret.<lb/>
That brings me to another side-effect of the youth training scheme. There is no doubt that colleges of further education must adapt to the demands of today, and that the youth training scheme has imposed considerable demands on them. For the very first time they were taking in young people with no educational qualification, and for the first time they were dealing with people who did not have five O levels or the equivalent in many areas. They have adapted and they are adapting. The principal complaint that came, from young people, out of the first year of the youth training scheme was in fact the lack of relevance of the off-the-job training. It is something which I am sure the colleges have taken note of and I look forward to this as one of the areas which will be improved not only this year, but in the years to come.<lb/>
May I say just a word about the monitoring which the Manpower Services Commission carries out? It is indeed in two parts. One is proper financial monitoring; that is essential in view of the large sums of public money which are dealt with. There is also quality control, and it is not quite good enough to say of the Manpower Services Commission that they are but civil servants and therefore cannot look for quality. George Tolley, as the man who founded the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0053"/>
<col>89</col>
Open Tech, took over at the beginning of this year responsibility for quality and I believe that we will see, from the results of the latest monitoring and from the way in which we are setting up project teams to look at quality, that the quality will improve and the Manpower Services Commission will make itself seen as a proper body to carry out such monitoring.<lb/>
Throughout it all, perhaps I may say, our constant concern is with ethic minorities. It is not an easy problem to solve, and it is not one which lies totally within the hands of the Manpower Services Commission. The whole essence of the youth training scheme is that it is a voluntary scheme&#x2014;voluntary for employers and voluntary for young people. In a way, as perhaps it should, it mirrors the rest of society, and when we have solved the problem of the ethnic minorities in the rest of society we will certainly have solved it in the youth training scheme. I hope that the youth training scheme can do something to reverse the process, by starting to lead, rather than to follow.<lb/>
May I say to my noble friend, Lady Carnegy, to whom I am indebted for introducing me into this House only last week and who was a notable chairman of our committee for Scotland, that this country must have, and this Government certainly have, a long-term commitment to vocational training. I was privileged to be a member of the council of the National Economic Development Organisation and chairman of the Manpower Services Commission when we commissioned the <i>Competence and Competition</i> report. The gap it shows is one which I believe all members of our society are beginning to take seriously.<lb/>
Of course, there is a difference between education and training. I became a solicitor. I am not too sure whether I was educated or trained in that craft. But what we have to do is to ensure that the fairly artificial boundaries that we created in the past are ones that merge imperceptibly together. I hope that our programmes&#x2014;and here the Government can give a lead and I thought were&#x2014;will bring together those in education and those in training, to realise that they have a common objective and a common purpose.<lb/>
I have heard much during this debate about a shared status for young people&#x2014;that is an aim that I would share. I may in a moment revert back to income because that poses a different order of problem. May I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Serota, about the fact that prospects for unskilled youth are indeed poor. The prospects for unskilled adults are poor. We live in a world where the prospects for those who are unskilled are, unfortunately, fewer and fewer.<lb/>
<i>Competence and Competition</i> drew out the spectrum that exists. On the one side, there is Japan which, although it has a general education, has a highly specific and employer-led training programme. On my last visit there, there was pointed out to me by name the one individual who changed his employer&#x2014;the one. It is a loss of face that is almost inconceivable in any other country. There it is perfectly proper and sensible for employers to invest a great deal of money in training their own employees, for they have the continued use and benefit of it.<lb/>
At the opposite end of the spectrum is the United States of America, where I would probably have
<col>90</col>
pointed out to me the one man who had stayed from the day of leaving school to the day of retirement in one company; where changing jobs is a way of life and where the whole process seems to go more and more towards individuals finding their own training and taking it with them when they leave. We, as in many other things in this world, are in the middle. Perhaps we have employers who are reluctant to spend money on training and we have individuals who are reluctant to assume that burden. That is the central dilemma.<lb/>
I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Serota, for asking me not to tinker, although I was warned later on that I should tinker and I am not sure how much I should or should not do. May I say to my noble friend Lady Vickers that, unfortunately, I left my wand with me with my budget at the Manpower Services Commission. I come without a portfolio, but with more than good intentions and with some experience in the past and with the opportunity, I hope, to look at a number of the fields which we have discussed this evening.<lb/>
There is considerable growth within the school system towards the objective of self-employment. No longer is it considered inconceivable or somehow improper that people should work for themselves. I have been to many schools up and down the land where at fifth form level, and even at sixth form level, projects are being undertaken to encourage young people to go off on their own; not that I believe for one moment that they should or could on leaving school, but to instil in them the virtues and objectives of working for yourself.<lb/>
I believe that we have another problem&#x2014;not perhaps within schools, but within our culture as a whole&#x2014;that we should not equate service with being servile. If there is one shortage within the pysche of this country it is that for some reason we feel inhibited about providing service and feel that in some way it is servile. Perhaps the respected profession of a waiter across the Channel is not quite so respected in this country and it is a problem that we have to solve. But I should not like to take France as a model for technical and vocational education, though I much admire what they do. They have a common curriculum, the same subject is taught to the same age group at the same hour each week.<lb/>
They have national service, but they have entirely different problems. There are some lessons to be learned, but not to be slavishly copied.<lb/>
I appreciate the problems that we have in rural areas and the Manpower Services Commission and Ministers agreed only a few months ago to increase the travel threshold to &#x00A3;3 a week. That means that the Manpower Services Commission will pay all travel expenses over &#x00A3;3 and not just a travel allowance of &#x00A3;3. I have visited schemes where young people are getting very substantial sums indeed. There is much that could be learned from rural areas and one or two schemes are beginning to consider the use of buses to take the off-the-job training out to young people. I hope this is something that can be encouraged.<lb/>
I listened very closely to what was said about Royal dockyards. My only immediate comment&#x2014;and I will undertake to look into the matter&#x2014;is that it is very important that we train for the skills that are likely to
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0054"/>
<col>91</col>
be required tomorrow. There are too many good training places in existence in this country, training the type of engineering skills which technology is taking out of utility. May I compliment the noble Baroness, Lady Lockwood, and say to her that her influence in this House is obviously all pervasive. After her days at the Equal Opportunities Commission, I looked at the speakers in today's debate and I realised that there is total parity. I agree with her on that. I agree with her totally on the sheer economic importance of training. If you like, the coin of profit has on one side of it productivity and on the other training, and it is only a combination of the two that will get us through.<lb/>
It is slightly difficult to compare us with Germany. Germany has a tradition that has carried through with guilds and training, and we have to create one. But whatever training we have, it must be broad based and there must be flexibility for the future. The first year of the YTS is a start. If I may make one point in conclusion, I should like to proffer the advice to the noble Baroness that she should not be surprised by reports in <i>The Times Educational Supplement</i>.<lb/>
The one theme which has run through this debate is the desire for common status and an allowance. Of course, I hope that we can see our way clear to some form of common status; but I would ask your Lordships to think again on the desire for an allowance. It seems to me that there is a great deal of difference between what a young person has to do in school in perhaps a 32-week year and what someone else has to do on the equivalent of a youth training scheme working three-quarters of a week and doing off-the-job training. The costs of education are very different from the costs of training. The contributions that people make are also different and it is a complex position.<lb/>
We shall certainly look at it within the committee, but I would find some difficulty with the concept. May I say again that the whole problem of sex stereotyping is not one which I suspect can be solved on the youth training scheme. It is not one which I suspect can be solved in schools. But it is one that starts at the very beginning with life in the home.<lb/>
Finally, may I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, that, rather as the distant rumbling of a summer storm, we hear again the sound of Mode B(1). The essential difference between the under-utilisation of B(1) and the under-utilisation of Mode A, which is the employer-based scheme, is that, at the most, Mode A would cost the Government &#x00A3;100, which is the managing agent fee, whereas under B(1) we have to ensure that the entire costs of a scheme and an empty place are actually met. I have another concern as well, which is that we ensure that the right people go into the right schemes; that there is a sufficient interchange and that those coming initially on a Mode B(1) type scheme will have the opportunity, not for promotion, but for change to a Mode A scheme, and that those coming initially on to a Mode A scheme have the opportunity to come back to a Mode B(1) scheme. I hope that the balance is about right, but I obtained assurances, which exist to this day, from Ministers at that time that if there is any shortgage it will be put right. That is a matter upon which I am quite sure
<col>92</col>
noble Lords will keep a close eye. I have no doubt at all that Ministers and the Manpower Services Commission will hear about it.<lb/>
In closing, may I point out that the funding of the Youth Training Scheme is slightly misunderstood. It is true that there is a budget and that an amount of money is allocated for it but it is a demand-led scheme. The amount of money which the MSC obtains for it is solely dependent upon the number of young people who enter the scheme. In the first year, the numbers going through it were reduced; because the original estimates were wrong, the figures had to be reduced. Secondly, they were reduced for motive which we certainly cannot criticise: that young people went into jobs. I hope that this year the figures will be closer. However, the only point to concern us is that the guarantee given by the Government that every eligibile young person who wants a place on the scheme will have a place by Christmas, is kept. Last Christmas about 1,500 people were still waiting to go on to the scheme. I hope that this Christmas, the numbers will be even better. This is the one figure which I hope will ensure that every young person who wants a place on the scheme will get it.<lb/>
I am very grateful for this debate, from which I have learned a great deal. I thank noble Lords for bearing with me on this my first appearance at the Dispatch Box.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Welfare Provision: Co-ordination</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00562">8.32 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00563"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to ensure that the relationship between voluntary organisations and governmental and other public bodies most effectively satisfies the needs of the community at large.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00564">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I am very grateful to have the opportunity to put this Motion before your Lordships this evening. I am even more grateful to those noble Lords who have stayed behind so unexpectedly long in order to make their contribution to the debate. It is a big and complex subject. I can do little more than provide the background and touch upon the role which the voluntary services play and the problems which they face and suggest some remedial action which the Government might take. I hope that from their knowledge and experience other speakers will fill in the gaps which I leave.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00565">There can be little doubt that in today's rapidly changing society it is necessary from time to time to examine the way in which services to the community are being provided. The purpose of the debate is to
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0055"/>
<col>93</col>
ascertain that through complementing each other the correct balance is held between the voluntary welfare agencies and governmental and other public bodies. Such an analysis seems to be even more crucial at present when the services of the voluntary bodies are under ever-increasing demand while their funding is rendered insecure through the rate-capping legislation and the proposed abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan councils.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00566">First, there can be little doubt that even in those early days the midwives of the welfare state, having put into operation their giant rescue operation for Britain's needy, must have believed that the state should do what the state alone can do; namely, ensure an appropriate allocation of financial resources and, that done, leave as much as possible to the initiative and enterprise of the individual. They recognised that many people are able and willing to serve the public and that to reject that help would mean delaying social advance and inhibiting self-criticism, experiment and innovation. The old-style concept of paternalism and philanthropy was acutely defined by Lord Beveridge when he said:
<quote>"Philanthropy springs from social conscience: the feeling which makes men who are materially comfortable mentally uncomfortable as long as their neighbours are materially uncomfortable".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00567">Although we live in a very different world, those basic principles surely remain true today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00568">Before commenting on the main theme of the Motion, may I say a few words about the volunteer in order both to remove the confusion which sometimes surrounds his precise circumstances and also to describe how his function is developing. The volunteer is a person who gives his or her services for nothing and who is active in both the voluntary and statutory sectors. The voluntary and charitable welfare organisations, on the other hand, like any other concern, employ some paid workers along with the unpaid volunteers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00569">There is little doubt that we in Britain are fortunate in having such a high proportion of people who give their services for nothing. The figure from the volunteer centre shows that with men and women volunteering on an equal basis, one in five of the population volunteer on a regular basis&#x2014;that is, monthly. It must therefore be recognised that the old prototype "do-gooder"&#x2014;the middle-class lady in her flowery hat and covered basket ministering to the needy&#x2014;has been joined by a wide range of additional people: for instance, young people who have grown up with a greater sense of caring and many retired people who wish to continue to make a contribution to society. Volunteering is being increasingly rcommended to unemployed people, 10 per cent. of whom, it has been ascertained, find some solace in voluntary work. It is also recommended to those who are revovering from depression and mental illness and who find helping others to be of therapeutic value to themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00570">There is no doubt that to protect our present system of employment and so on and to make full use of the services of this greater band of unpaid workers, adjustments must be made. To mention but a few, the voluntary service unit at the Home Office has now become inadequate and its resources and manpower
<col>94</col>
need to be increased. The unit, instead of playing a passive role, could be made more into a development unit sponsoring experimental programmes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00571">Secondly, more funds are needed for research into ways of better co-ordinating the work of volunteers. Recognition that volunteers now often come from low income group needs some form of compensation, such as travelling expenses, insurance cover, lunch, <i>et cetera</i>. These have all become necessary. But there is another aspect. I am sometimes astonished by the patronising and sometimes almost scornful attitude shown by some members of the community towards, as they call them, the "do-gooders", almost as if they would prefer the opposite, the evil doers. I feel most strongly that those who so generously put themselves at the service of others at least deserve the support and admiration of their fellow citizens.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00572">What of the voluntary welfare organisations themselves? What is their true role, representing one important arm in the structure of provision as they now do? First, they can undoubtedly complement the work of the stautory bodies through themselves not being bound up in the same bureaucracy. This applies in particular to advice bureaux. It is indisputable in our complex society, with its equally complex set of rules and benefits, that consumers increasingly require expert advice and assistance on matters of individual concern. This increases the role played by advice agencies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00573">Secondly, not only can voluntary organisations take advantage of modern technology to spearhead new methods of helping people, but through innovation they are in the best position to experiment. Indeed, it is only the voluntary bodies who can work on the basis that, out of 10 initiatives, if seven fail then that must be seen in the light of three successes. For the state to incur such a high failure rate would provoke a public outcry&#x2014;and rightly so. So this is the realm for voluntary organisations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00574">Thirdly, voluntary organisations, working as they do close to the ground, are far better placed to identify the true needs, and consequently they can provide a more sensitive pattern of service. Equally, they can often respond more quickly to needs than can state bodies, without cumbersome bureaucratic machinery. Finally of course voluntary organisations provide a greater choice of welfare provisions to the consumer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00575">I should like to give one example of the problems facing voluntary and charitable welfare organisations before I conclude by suggesting ways in which the Government might meet these problems and build that better partnership to which they appear to aspire. The example I have taken concerns problems facing the Women's National Cancer Control Campaign, of which I have just become chairman. I believe the problems are very typical. This organisation was set up 20 years ago to provide health education concerning cancer risks to women and provide screening programmes for early detection of cervical and breast cancer. The need for early detection has been proved by the fact that 98 per cent. of women who die from this form of cancer were never screened. These programmes are carried out in mobile units set up at the gates of factories or in the town or village square. It has now been proved that women&#x2014;especially older,
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0056"/>
<col>95</col>
working class women, who are in fact most at risk&#x2014;prefer to be screened in a mobile unit rather than by their general practitioner or at a health clinic.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00576">The Women's National Cancer Control Campaign has now become a victim of its own success; the more women hearken to our warning, the more clients we have for our screening programmes. Consequently, our costs have escalated while our DHSS grant has remained unchanged. Like other organisations, we are forced to turn more and more to the public and grapple with the time-consuming and highly specialised task of fund-raising rather than responding to the real needs of women.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00577">My other example concerns citizens advice bureaux, whose importance, as I have said, cannot be underrated in today's climate of rising unemployment, rising rents, and the increasingly complex web of social security and welfare benefits. The citizens advice bureaux, of which there are 900 in England and Wales, employ fewer than 10 per cent. paid staff&#x2014;the rest being volunteers. In 1983&#x2013;84 the bureaux estimate to have dealt with about 5 million inquiries and received &#x00A3;10 million cash grant aid from the local authorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00578">The bureaux estimate that inquiries will increase at a rate of 500,000 a year from 1985&#x2013;86 but their finances risk being severely curtailed. &#x00A3;6 million of the &#x00A3;10 million could be affected by rate limitations and &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million is very likely to be directly affected by rate capping. And the 1986&#x2013;87 GLC and metropolitan counties abolition Bill will affect approximately &#x00A3;1 million local grant aid to CABs. But of course, it will be the 600 bureaux in Greater London which will be mainly affected by both rate capping and abolition. How will these bureaux continue to offer adequate advice services? Already there is a great deal of unfulfilled demand, when one realises that only 48 per cent. of the families with two parents and dependent children who are entitled to housing benefit actually claim it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00579">I shall conclude by putting forward a few suggestions to the Minister. It is obvious that more money is needed by the voluntary sector to meet their increased workload&#x2014;but in order not to become a target for the social services secretary, who was reported a few weeks ago to have called for,
<quote>"an end to these rather self-centred and totally sterile wrangles about who provides",</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00580">I suggest that the minimum acceptable standards of provision in health, housing, education, etc., should be established and that the Government accept the obligation to ensure that those standards are provided. Following this, an assessment could be made as to which of the agencies available would be the most effective providers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00581">Secondly, the Government have said that they do not want to see the voluntary sector impeded by rate capping and the abolition proposals&#x2014;but still they have not put their words into effect. And from the point of view of the security of voluntary organisations and their forward planning, surely when organisations are shown to be making a really valuable contribution, they should be given enough assurance of long-term support to enable them to plan and build up professional staff.</p>
<col>96</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00582">For example, funding programmes should be on a three-year minimum basis, and one year nonrenewable programmes should not be introduced. Furthermore, the Government should recognise the absurd cash-flow problems caused even to quite large voluntary organisations by the Government's tradition of always paying their agents well in arrears and bureaucractic delays in negotiation and payment. These have become legendary. No business organisation would tolerate such a system for a moment, because it makes for extreme inefficiency and insecurity.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00583">My third point is that charities must one day be relieved of the burden of VAT. This is constantly under discussion but it has never actually happened. Fourthly, surely voluntary organisations should be consulted more. They have the enormous advantage of being close to the ground and knowing what is going on. From another aspect, should not the Government consult them before introducing major policy changes which will bring severe, unforeseen disruption to their work?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00584">Lastly, with the voluntary sector playing such an important role in the provision of services, there can be no doubt that there should be a junior Minister particularly responsible for co-ordinating its work. This would be of immeasurable value to both efficiency and morale. I believe that changes such as these could go a long way to rescuing the voluntary sector from its present dilemma and demoralised state. This condition is further aggravated by the Government sometimes managing to give the impression that they regard caring agencies as a rather soppy province of the unreliable Left wing. The changes I have suggested would also contribute to establishing the effective partnership and correct balance between voluntary bodies and the state which the Government claim they wish to see but which, in the view of many of us involved in this work, they appear to have done so little to implement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00585">There is no doubt in my mind that the spur for many of those in the voluntary services who work so hard to bring assistance to Britain's least fortunate citizens is a sense of social justice and compassion. The Government have still to prove through their actions that they are governed by the same compulsion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00586">8.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00587"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we must all be grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for raising this subject in our debate today. It is a timely debate, in as much as the voluntary sector feels under threat. It is this threat that is of deep concern not only to the voluntary sector but also to the statutory sector.<lb/>
In <i>Hansard</i> for 30th April 1984, my noble friend Lord Bellwin is quoted as saying in a debate on the Rates Bill:
<quote>"May I say at the outset that the Government need no strictures at all on their role in connection with, or support for voluntary organisations. The Government's record over the last five years stands so far ahead of anything done previously for voluntary organisations&#x2014;I make that statement categoricaly".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 30/4/84; col. 381.]</quote>
In some areas I have much cause to be particularly grateful for the partnership between the statutory and the voluntary sectors. I quote but two examples. As a member of the Dr. Barnardo Council I would point
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0057"/>
<col>97</col>
out that we are in partnership with the Department of Health and Social Security in making arrangements for the mentally handicapped children being brought up in mental hospitals to come into the community. This partnership has been most effective with the financial help and encouragement of the Department of Health and Social Security. In addition, I am also a governor of two schools for maladjusted children. In both cases the Department of Education and the Department of Health have worked in partnership with the schools in providing better facilites for such children. Those are examples of two organisations only. It is easy to have a partnership between one authority and another authority.<lb/>
However, the position with regard to voluntary organisations now, with the pending debate on the abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils, presents a very real problem for the voluntary sector, as the noble Baroness said in her speech. I have read with care the yellow document <i>The Abolition of the Greater London Council and the Metropolitan County Councils</i> issued by the Department of the Environment. I suggest that we should consider the way in which we discussed the paving Bill some months ago. Her Majesty's Government felt impelled to bring in a paving Bill before actually passing the Bills in connection with the abolition of the metropolitan counties and the Greater London Council. By the same token the voluntary sector thinks&#x2014;rightly so&#x2014;that at the moment it should be preparing for this change should it come about. This is where we run into trouble.<lb/>
There are very real difficulties. First, is there to be the money for the transition stage? Secondly&#x2014;and the noble Baroness has already referred to this&#x2014;who is to have the overall responsibility for both facilitating and maintaining grants and support to the voluntary organisations? The noble Baroness suggested that there should be a junior Minister who would be responsible. In the debate that we have just had on the EC report of Lord Seebohm, regarding the employment of young people, the Minister replied that he was setting up a committee of four ministries in order to get the four ministries working together. If it can be done in one area, it should be possible for it to be done in another.<lb/>
The real difficulty for the voluntary sector with the proposed legislation, which I admit had not yet come in, is the number of people involved and how one is to get them all to face in the same direction. That involves the support of the voluntary sector, which Her Majesty's Government so much recommends. For example the Citizens' Advice Bureau, to which the noble Baroness referred, receives a grant for the central running of its office from the Department of Trade and Industry. The local offices get their grants, or it is expected they will get their grants, from the local authorities in whose areas their local offices are located. Let us suppose that the local authority&#x2014;not necessarily a rate-capped authority, because there will be only 17 rate-capped authorities&#x2014;has not had experience of the extraordinarily good and splendid work of the citizens' advice bureaux and decides that it has the capacity to deal with the inquiries itself. What then becomes of the citizens' advice bureau?<lb/>
<col>98</col>
There are other voluntary organisations which have already fallen because they are not supported by their local authority. I can quote two examples. One is in a local authority area where there was a foster parent agency which found foster parents for children in care. In another local authority, really difficult families were helped. This body's work was not understood by the local authority and the grant was withdrawn.<lb/>
Do the Government not feel that a very strong lead is required from them? If a local authority has an ideological attitude not to support the voluntary sector&#x2014;and I have to say that there are some such authorities&#x2014;where do the Government stand from the point of view of supporting the voluntary sector? There is great deal of division. How is this to be woven together to support the voluntary sector?<lb/>
The noble Baroness referred to the numbers, and I shall refer to them again. The citizens' advice bureaux have 12,000 volunteers, with only 1,000 paid staff. That figure can be multiplied through all the different voluntary organisations. Therefore, I suggest that a very strong lead, of a very positive nature, is required from Her Majesty's Government if they want to support the voluntary sector. I support the noble Baroness in saying that there needs to be a structure, which does not exist at the moment, with one person, one Minister in one place, who is responsible for sponsoring the voluntary movement.<lb/>
The noble Baroness has referred to the Home Office volunteer service unit. She referred to other ministries. Add to that the local authorites throughout the country and the local authority associations, and I agree with her and support her wholeheartedly in saying that there should be one person responsible for supporting and encouraging the voluntary sector and encouraging those who should be employing the voluntary sector.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00588">8.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00589"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question of the noble Baroness refers to the relationship between voluntary welfare organisations and governmental and other public bodies. Before concentrating on that I think it is worth drawing attention to the very important and developing role of voluntary bodies in local economic development and job creation.<lb/>
A report issued only recently by a joint working party of the three local authority associations and the NCVO, sponsored by the National Westminster Bank, gives some very interesting instances of these developments, and I recommend it to your Lordships. It can be obtained from the NCVO. Incidentally, I went to the launch of this document, which received all-party support from this House. The noble Lord, Lord Rochester, was there for the Liberals, the noble Lords, Lord Sandford and Lord Boardman, for the Conservatives and myself for the Social Democrats. There were Labour speakers, too. That, of course, is not really the subject of this debate. I just wanted to give a plug for this document, which is rather good.<lb/>
We are extremely fortunate in having in this country an active and growing voluntary sector. It is deeply rooted in our traditions. It not only operates in the chinks and crevices of the social structure where statutory bodies neither can nor should penetrate, but
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0058"/>
<col>99</col>
is also playing an increasingly important role in joint action with the statutory services and as agents for them.<lb/>
At a time of terrific pressure on public resources it can never be stressed too strongly&#x2014;the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, seldom misses an opportunity to make this point, but she did not make it today and so I shall make it for her&#x2014;that voluntary bodies are extraordinarily cost-effective. This seems to be almost a self-evident truth, as much of their input is free. Yet we should not think of voluntary organisations only as associations of amiable and-worthy amateurs depending entirely on charitable trusts and donations. Many are now highly professional. The voluntary movement as a whole employs something like 160,000 paid employees who provide the professional framework for the delivery of the service. So funding from a variety of sources is essential if standards are to be maintained and new needs are to be met.<lb/>
I have here another useful publication by the Charities Aid Foundation of charity statistics 1983&#x2013;84, which tells us a great deal about the sources of funding for voluntary bodies. In 1983&#x2013;84 the top 200 grant-making trusts provided &#x00A3;208 million to the voluntary sector. The top 200 corporate donors, headed by Barclays Bank with &#x00A3; 1,724,000, provided a total of &#x00A3;34 million. This source appears to be slightly on the increase again after the slump in 1981&#x2013;82, but still only represents 0&#x00B7;21 per cent. of profits in 1983&#x2013;84. I understand that there is a movement aimed at securing 1 per cent. of corporate profits, but of course this still has a very long way to go.<lb/>
The total central Government grants in the last year for which figures are available, that is 1982&#x2013;83, amounted to nearly &#x00A3;151 million. This figure has been increasing quite sharply, mainly due to the urban programme, but it will be recalled that 75 per cent. of that vitally important programme is local authority funded. Unsuccessful attempts were made in this House during the passing of the Rates Bill (now an Act) to protect their contribution from rate-capping. There is thus a real effect to some of the very valuable schemes being run by charities under this programme.<lb/>
It should also be remembered that central Government contributions have risen, both in real terms and as a percentage of grants from official bodies. Local authority contributions have declined from something like four times those of central Government to only about twice those of central Government. So the ratio is changing dramatically.<lb/>
I am not entirely sure that that is a desirable trend. One must always remember that charities working in the welfare and social security field depend overwhelmingly on local government contributions. The big national charities will of course always survive, but there are myriads of small local charities which may well go to the wall.<lb/>
This brings me specifically to the local authority input to the voluntary sector. Much of this is channelled through the social services department in the form of grants and fees. Actually, fees are four times the amount of grants. The total payment by social security authorities to voluntary bodies in
<col>100</col>
1981&#x2013;82 amounted to &#x00A3;173 million. Extracting the shire counties alone, this sum amounted to &#x00A3;61 million in 1982&#x2013;83, representing approximately three-quarters of their payments to voluntary bodies for all purposes, and indicating beyond doubt the reliance that they place on the voluntary sector in carrying out their welfare programmes.<lb/>
Most of the authorities to be rate-capped fall outside the shire counties. So there must be a fear that the grants and fees amounting to some &#x00A3;112 million made by social security departments, other than those of the shire counties, will be specially at risk under the Rates Act.<lb/>
The statistics do not go down to borough and district level. However, if&#x2014;I say if, because it has not happened yet&#x2014;the metropolitan counties and the GLC are abolished, there must be serious doubts whether the smaller authorities will be able or willing to fund even a small proportion of the contributions previously made by the strategic authorities.<lb/>
This brings me to the question which I was going to put to the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, of which I have given him prior notice. Your Lordships may recall that during the passage of the Rates Bill (which is now the Rates Act) through your Lordships' House, the risk to local authority grants to charities was widely recognised on all sides of the House. Various attempts were made to secure exemptions from rate-capping for such grants. The discussions were to my mind somewhat sidetracked by the prominence given to the GLC's payments to certain bodies felt not to be proper recipients of public funds. But they were a tiny minority of all recipients, and I think most sensible people recognise the value and cost effectiveness of most of the voluntary sector projects receiving support.<lb/>
A compromise was eventually reached, promoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull. I hope she does not think I am poaching on her ground here, but it was supported by myself, by, I think, the noble Lord, Lord Seebohm, and the noble Lord, Lord Ennals. That compromise now appears as Section 3(9) of the Rates Act. In fact, it was mentioned, with some rather high hopes I think, by the Charities Aid Foundation in the introduction to their book of statistics. I quote this:
<quote>"The Government has apparently accepted Lady Faithfull's amendment to the Rate Capping Bill in the House of Lords to allow the creation of special appeal procedures where cuts lead to the withdrawal of grants from a local authority to the voluntary sector".</quote>
I do not know whether it is the recollection of the noble Baroness but it is certainly my recollection that in the debate the Government undertook to issue guidelines on how this subsection is supposed to operate. I am not aware of any having appeared yet. I understand, or I have been told, that the Secretary of State has written to the councils about this, although I have been unable to obtain a copy of the letter, if it exists. The only thing that I have been able to obtain from the Department of the Environment is a press notice and a memorandum on the proposed transitional arrangements, to which I think the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, was referring, on abolition of the strategic authorities, in which they propose collection funding between the boroughs, which will be triggered off by a two-third majority of the boroughs agreeing or wanting to fund a particular
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0059"/>
<col>101</col>
charity. And there is going to be a limit of &#x00A3;10 million in respect of Greater London and &#x00A3;3 million in respect of all the metropolitan counties together&#x2014;I cannot quite believe that. This may be of interest to the noble Baroness. I shall be very happy to pass her a copy of it or to let her see this one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00590"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord give way? May I just say that I did go into all this. I am very grateful that the noble Lord has brought up this matter. What I think the noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, the Minister at that time on the Rates Bill, said was that he would consider issuing guidelines. Then when I went to him at a later stage he said that there were going to be other arrangements and therefore guidelines would not be issued. The document to which the noble Lord now refers relates to the arrangements for discussion with the voluntary organisations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00591"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that intervention. What I am saying, I think, is that this is something that we shall have occasion to discuss in the future. I understand that legislation will be required to bring these transistional arrangements into effect. I also want to say that, so far as I can see, this does not help us on the specific point I am making about the noble Baroness's amendment. All that is clear to me is that the procedure provided for in Section 3(9) can only operate if an authority applies for redetermination under subsection (4), in which case charities can write to the Secretary of State in support of their case. However, it appears that not a single rate-capped authority&#x2014;I have checked this today&#x2014;has applied for redetermination for the coming year. So where does that leave charities which find their grant reduced or eliminated?<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, whom we miss because he really tried to meet us on this, said at column 76 on 18th June that they could:
<quote>"make an independent case if the authority was proposing to reduce their support".</quote>
But what, I want to ask the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, is the situation if their authority has not applied for derogation either on their behalf or for any other reason? I suppose that there is nothing to stop them writing to the Secretary of State, but he presumably has no right to oblige a local authority to apply for re-determination to maintain its grant expenditure. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, referred to possible ideological objections by some authorities against doing this. Is it not therefore possible and perhaps even likely that this subsection may be much less effective than its promoters imagined or the Government intended? I may be wrong. I hope that I am. But it is important to get this clear. That is why I am asking for enlightenment. I know that this is not the noble Lord's department. I hope, however, that he has been able to seek advice from his colleagues in Marsham Street.<lb/>
Finally, why is this matter important? Why are these matters that we are discussing this evening important? The noble Lord, Lord Bellwin, provided the answer on 18th June at column 75 when he said:
<quote>"Because grants are often small and short term they may seem easy to cut; but to the organisations which rely on them, and whose
<col>102</col>
scope for savings may be very limited, they can be far more damaging than cuts in larger services".</quote>
There is also the larger consideration which the Government simply must take on board. If the policy or, if you like, the ethos of care in the community is to be effective, it must rely to a considerale extent on the voluntary sector. It has been estimated that the charitable sector accounts for 25 per cent. of all expenditure on social welfare. If that is reduced and even the public sector funding stays level, there will be a net loss of welfare at a time of increasing demographic pressure. All the signs are that both sectors face a reduction. If that happens, you might as well scrap the concept of community care, the closing of all those gloomy Victorian hospitals and all the other things that the Government say that they want to do. We are fortunate to have an active and deeply-rooted voluntary sector in this country. Goodness knows what we should do without it! Let us make sure, at a time of growing needs, that it can operate with maximum effectiveness.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00593"><member>The Lord Bishop of Chichester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this hour I shall try to be brief. I should like to begin by recalling that the voluntary societies and organisations have a long history in our country. Back to the time when I was Dean of Worcester. I was <i>ex officio</i> master of almshouses founded by Saint Oswald in the 10th century. It is in that area that the Church has particularly contributed throughout the history of our land. I suppose that since the middle of the 19th century we have seen a great expansion of this work, with the starting of Dr. Barnardo's Homes in 1867 and other work for children; Waifs and Strays, now the Church of England Children's Society, and so forth; and, more recently, organisations for the provision of housing and shelter for the mentally and physically handicapped. At the same time, while this has been going on there has been a growing dependence on public funds as people in general have become less able to make substantial financial contributions from private sources. That is an important element to be recognised.<lb/>
I hope that I can speak from a rather less controversial area of the country. The GLC does not extend into Sussex. Nor do we have any metropolitan authorities there. All the local authorities in Sussex, I think, are Conservative-controlled. We have a very valuable partnership with all the local authorities in Sussex. I think particularly of the main centre of population in Brighton and Hove, of St. Gabriel's family centre in Brighton, founded by the Church of England Children's Society and run by joint funding between that society and the Brighton borough, which also houses the Portage project where parents are helped to teach handicapped children basic skills.<lb/>
I think also of the St. John's day centre in Hove where part of a large church has been set aside, in co-operation with the borough and the county, as a day centre for the elderly; plans we have for something similar at St. Patrick's Church in Hove; the Brighton Housing Trust which has a special concern for the housing of the single homeless, those who have been released from mental hospitals, the elderly&#x2014;and we have many elderly people living often in deplorable
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0060"/>
<col>103</col>
conditions. All of this is run by a splendid partnership in funding and co-operation between mainly the borough council but also the county councils and the voluntary organisations.<lb/>
But now there is a very great anxiety&#x2014;an anxiety which results from financial uncertainty. The voluntary bodies ought to be able to do forward planning. They ought to be able to employ their staff responsibly. They ought not to have to divert the energies of skilled people into fund raising when they could be so much better employed in using the skills that they have for the help of those in need. There is a need constantly to be able to respond to changing conditions and the perception of fresh needs.<lb/>
That part of the funding which depends on voluntary giving is always bound to have a large element of uncertainty about it. It becomes all the more necessary that the Government and local authority funding should provide the essential element of stability in the work. It is that which is now feared to be in question, partly through the cuts but particularly at present, as has been said already, through the rate-capping and the fear of what will happen as a result of the abolition of the metropolitan authorities in other areas.<lb/>
Our own local authorities in Sussex&#x2014;county and borough&#x2014;are very careful spenders. They are more usually criticised for under-spending than for overspending. They want to be supportive but they fear that they run the risk of being penalised if they are. There have been a number of occasions in the course of this year when I have been in discussion with one or other authority about various projects which they would be only too delighted to support because they can see the need for them and the importance of them; but every time there has to be this caution, "Well, we've got to look at our expenditure as a whole and we fear that if we go in on this we shall be penalised".<lb/>
I hope very much, therefore, that the Secretary of State for the Environment, who one understands is now conducting an internal Government inquiry into local authority finance, will take this problem into that inquiry and give the closest and most serious attention to this problem of funding and giving support to the voluntary organisations on whom so much of our provision for the welfare of those in need depends.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00595"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a real pleasure to follow the right reverend Prelate. As someone who lives in East Sussex I know that he is exceptionally well qualified to speak on these matters. I heartily congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, my friend and colleague, not only on promoting this subject but on the way she has made us all think about it afresh. My trouble is that I spoke on this subject better in 1949 than I am ever likely to speak about it again. If I say I spoke at that time for the Government in the first main debate on voluntary action after the war, and if I say that I spoke for 46 minutes, your Lordships will realise that in those days the House was more tolerant and long suffering than it is today.<lb/>
However, at that time it was quite important that a clear speech should be made on behalf of the Attlee
<col>104</col>
Government, the first Labour government after the war, in favour of voluntary action. There were many doubts, not least among Labour supporters and also elsewhere, as to whether the principle of the welfare state was compatible with the principle of voluntary action. I hope that those doubts were somewhat allayed after I had spoken. I have always been interested in voluntary action, like most other noble Lords; but if it had been just a personal effort it would have been of no significance. In fact, Herbert Morrison, then Deputy Prime Minister, took an enormous personal interest in the subject. He was determined that the Labour Party should be fully committed to the whole principle of voluntary action. He supplied me with what were probably the best phrases in that speech. When it was over he circulated it to all Labour Ministers and made sure that from then on it was Labour Party policy to support voluntary action along with the welfare state which was then being built up.<lb/>
The debate on that occasion was initiated by the Liberals, by Lord Samuel and Lord Beveridge, who were already addicted to those principles. So in that sense it was an important occasion. I shall quote only a few sentences, but they are better than I can deliver now. If the noble Lord can say something better at the conclusion of this debate, then good luck to him. I have every reason to hope that he may be able to do so. What I said on 22nd June 1949, at col. 119, when speaking for the Government was:
<quote>"We consider that the voluntary spirit is the very lifeblood of democracy"&#x2014;</quote>
I remember that coming from Herbert Morrison&#x2014;
<quote>"We consider that the individual volunteer, the man who is proud to serve the community for nothing, is he whose personal sense of mission inspires and elevates the whole democratic process of official Government effort. We are convinced that voluntary associations have rendered, are rendering, and must be encouraged to continue to render, great and indispensable service to the community".</quote>
As I have said, I hope that the noble Lord will be able to improve on those words, but I think that he might find it quite difficult. At any rate that has been the official attitude of the Labour Party ever since that time. The Liberal Party were already committed and I shall have a word to say about the Conservatives later.<lb/>
Let us come to the present day. I hope that there could be some general agreement about voluntary action in principle. But voluntary bodies today are full of alarm. I and others said a good deal about this during the debates on the GLC and the abolition of the other metropolitan bodies. Those fears which the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, and others have brought out have not been allayed at all since that time. I hope that by the end of this debate some anxieties will be reduced, but I do not know whether or not that will turn out to be the case.<lb/>
As regards the Government's general policy, they really must not be surprised if there is much nervousness in the circles of the voluntary bodies. The Government cannot have it both ways. I understand that they take pride in the fact that they are attempting to cut public expenditure. They are not cutting defence, and I am not personally suggesting that they should cut defence. But if they are not cutting defence
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0061"/>
<col>105</col>
it means, in practice, reducing the social services; it means at any rate reducing them below what they would be if the Government policy were not being pursued, although with the greater number of old people and unemployed it is difficult to know whether the total amount spent would go up or down. But the Government are engaged in a policy of reducing public expenditure. If I am mistaken the noble Lord will put me right. If that is so, it must mean that the total of welfare provision will be less under their auspices, and that more will be left to the individual and the principle of self-help than would be the case under some different philosophy. So much for the welfare state. We are not dealing with statutory bodies; we are not arguing about them now; we argue about them often enough.<lb/>
However, tonight we are discussing the voluntary bodies, the third arm if you like, taking the state bodies and the local bodies as the other two. Here I venture to think that in principle there might be more agreement. The philosophy of the noble Lord's party, particularly under the present dispensation&#x2014;it might not be so under some wetter form of Conservatism&#x2014;is that the present Government want individuals to stand more on their own feet and to have less done for them by the state. That is the philosophy on which they have been elected twice, and if they like they can take pride in the fact that up till now the public seem ready to swallow that.<lb/>
However, that does not affect the question of the voluntary bodies because there the Conservatives ought surely to be as sympathetic as Socialists and Liberals. The principle of charity&#x2014;and I am not at all ashamed of using that word; I think that it is very creditable to anyone who is charitable either in the technical sense or in any other&#x2014;and the principle of mutual self-help are surely principles which we can all applaud irrespective of party. So in this area there is no ideological difference as there is or must be when it comes to deciding how much the state will do in providing welfare. Here I would hope that there was at any rate a starting point of agreement. Therefore, I have some hopes that the noble Lord will say something encouraging tonight.<lb/>
<col>106</col>
I conclude by making a comment on one remark that fell from the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, and also from the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull&#x2014;the suggestion that there should be some sort of Minister who will play some useful part in connection with voluntary bodies. If I say that that is not a new suggestion, no-one will think that I am disparaging it, but in 1949 that was a suggestion put forward from the Liberal Benches by Lord Beveridge, supported by Lord Samuel. They put forward the idea of a Minister guardian (he was not exactly a full Minister) for the voluntary bodies. Up till now that idea has never been adopted.<lb/>
Of course, there are obvious objections to such an idea. The noble Lord who is to reply is an accomplished debater, and he will not find it difficult to point to some objections, so perhaps I could point out one or two of them in advance, and that will spoil his speech! I admit that there are objections. I favour the idea, but I believe that it needs careful working out for this reason. We have all mentioned bodies with which we are particularly connected. I shall take as an example a youth centre which I helped to found and of which I am the chairman. One way or another we take the hat round to four or five Government departments. I am just trying to think how this Minister guardian, or whatever he would be called, would help us. I suppose that he would be a sort of ally at headquarters; but when it came to going to the particular departments we would hardly go through him. Therefore, it is a little hard to see how he would help us, but there he would be. I should like to think that he had all of his time to devote to this matter.<lb/>
I raise those points only because I am sure that the noble Lord the Minister will mention them if I do not. There are fairly obvious difficulties and no doubt they have prevented the establishment of any such Minister from 1949 until the present day. It is a tremendous subject. I think that my noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs has done extraordinarily well to raise it and I hope and pray that the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, will be able to say something encouraging.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00597"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wholeheartedly thank the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for giving us this opportunity to debate what I consider to be a most important subject. Perhaps I should declare a personal interest as I am associated with several voluntary welfare organisations and also serve on some public bodies. I am very well aware that good co-operation between the voluntary and statutory organisations must be of benefit to the people in the community who need assistance. Voluntary organisations very often act as a safety net for those people who fall through gaps in the statutory services. They also supplement the statutory services. They also sometimes provide a choice. If people have a choice they often tend to be more satisfied with the service provided. The problem so often is that there are so many demands on our welfare services, be they voluntary or statutory bodies, that they may be hard-pressed to fulfil their aims of helping those they are there to serve.<lb/>
It is wrong if voluntary organisations are considered cheap options for statutory bodies which have a commitment to provide a service, but many voluntary organisations do an efficient job and are covering some aspects of welfare work where there is no Government provision. Many of these services cover the most difficult and demanding welfare work such as alcoholism and drug addiction. I must here pay a tribute to the Salvation Army whose members often work with people and in places which others fear to cover.<lb/>
Many voluntary welfare organisations are most grateful to the Government for the grants they receive. Many of these bodies would find it difficult to pay their staff and run their offices if it were not for these grants. I was one of the founders of such an organisation. Ten years ago we founded the Spinal Injuries Association. Before that time some of the most severely disabled people in society did not have a voluntary body to support them, and the lack of this was very evident. Our full members are those people who have had damage to their spinal cord and have remained paralysed. Associate members are relatives and friends and interested professional people.<lb/>
Our service gives support, information, advice, and our welfare service provides a care agency for severely paralysed people who need a specially-trained person to go into the home and take the place of the carer in an emergency. No such provision existed, and the anxiety among some of our high-lesion tetraplegics&#x2014;these are people who have broken their necks and have remained paralysed from the neck down&#x2014;was very great indeed.<lb/>
We also have some specialised holiday facilities such as two adapted narrow boats so that a family can go on holiday with the disabled member who can steer the boat. The Spinal Injuries Association helps families to piece together their world. It acts as a bridge between paraplegic problems and interested bodies such as hospitals. Government departments, employers and local authorities. It seeks to break down the barriers that some people find when trying to get on with life. We run a quarterly newsletter, organise scientific research, and we have a legal department. We try to
<col>108</col>
encourage statutory and voluntary improvements in access, mobility, housing and employment.<lb/>
This year Her Royal Highness Princess Anne has become our patron. This gave our members and our hardworking staff a great boost. Her Royal Highness works exceedingly hard and we are particularly pleased to have her taking an interest in our work. As this debate covers "other public bodies", I thought that the Royal Family deserved a mention for their immense patronage and the help they give to voluntary associations.<lb/>
We are also pleased to have interested medical personnel from the DHSS whom we hope are interested in our work. We are pleased when they come to our meetings, and delighted when they give us advice. I was recently told that the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, had visited the spinal unit at Southport during the Summer Recess. I should like him to know that his visit was welcomed and that it boosted their morale.<lb/>
My Lords, this summer I submitted a Question for Written Answer asking how many people this year had broken their necks and remained paralysed from diving accidents. There have been far too many, and these are all young people. Our association is also interested in accident prevention. The Answer came back that no such information was held centrally.<lb/>
We try to satisfy the needs of the community. We try to look into current anxieties. Perhaps it would be easier to promote accident prevention if the Government departments co-ordinated more relevant information, for I believe that this would help the needs of the community. If we could devise an accident prevention drive to help young people become aware of some of the dangers, it might alleviate these problems.<lb/>
Fund raising takes a great deal of time and energy for most voluntary organisations. We are lucky in this country that we have such generous people who support all sorts of fund raising activities. I should like to pay a special tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Crawshaw, who has helped most generously with the Smiths Charity Trust.<lb/>
I have the honour to be president of the North Yorkshire branch of the British Red Cross Society. Since 1870 the British Red Cross has been helping to relieve suffering in health and welfare. The Red Cross flag is known throughout the world as a symbol of hope and trust. The Red Cross helps in many different ways in the welfare field. It runs hospital libraries and picture libraries, trolley shops, meals on wheels, stroke clubs, escort duties and so on. But one of its most important functions is to train people in first aid and home nursing. In the aftermath of the horrific Brighton bomb outrage, first aid should be one of our priorities. The correct first aid procedure cannot only save life, it can help to prevent long-lasting injury.<lb/>
With so many people staying a shorter time in hospital, home nursing is as important now as it ever has been. So many people are discharged from hospital on a Friday. What could be more dreary than returning alone to a cold, empty house with no food? We need more committed volunteer workers to bridge the gap between hospital and getting well in one's own
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0063"/>
<col>109</col>
home. Most convalescent homes have closed down. In rural areas district nurses often do not work after 6 p.m. When the hospitals were small and more community-based, it seemed easier to get the Red Cross nurses and voluntary aids trained in hospitals. Since the loss of the matron and medical superintendent and the depersonalisation of hospitals, this has made matters much more difficult. We have some splendid doctors and nurses who instruct and train, but sometimes we are short of instructors to train. We provide first aid courses for industry and many other groups.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will look into the need to provide adequate places for volunteers to be trained when Government institutions are needed to provide their facilities. I admit that there are problems such as our volunteers being more generally free in the evenings and at weekends, and hospitals being sometimes very technical with a quick turnover. But if care in the community for a large section of the population is to be possible then I hope that the hospitals will be more willing to help give basic training to those who need it. Training could also be given by district nurses and health visitors. It is so often at the GP and district nursing primary care level that volunteers are needed to supplement the service. In Leicester the Red Cross run a medical loan service so efficiently that it does the job administering the statutory provisions. It also runs a bureau for information which is greatly used by the community at large.<lb/>
In a developing and changing world new and different needs continue to emerge. The Red Cross keeps looking at its training programmes and hoping to have modules attached to the advanced certificate such as mountain rescue, mental health, first aid, and so on. Health care is so important that I feel it should be taught to all children at every school. There has been an experiment in Seattle in the United States of America in cardiopulmonary resuscitation; CPR. The basic training for this mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and cardiac compression takes about five hours. It is said that it can be done in three hours. About 20,000 people have already been trained in Brighton. It is said that this could cover all of England by 1986 because the public want it.<lb/>
There seems to be a great deal to do. In my branch in one village a volunteer Red Cross physiotherapy service is run using a paid trained physiotherapist. This gives a choice to people who just cannot face a long journey to a big hospital. I visited it a few weeks ago and every patient was more than grateful for the service received, including the cup of coffee, homemade biscuits and a friendly reception. The patients are all referred by their general practitioners. They pay what they can afford. Some are covered by insurance. It is a service and not a profit-making project. It takes place in a village hall near their homes.<lb/>
A high proportion of statutory services developed from voluntary initiatives because it was recognised that the certainty and continuation of provision were essential for the welfare of the country; and the statutory services developed and took on many of these functions, such as the probation service. In some
<col>110</col>
instances, such as child abuse, they provide a partnership with statutory services fulfilling statutory obligations. The NSPCC seem to be working in close co-operation with local authorities far more than they did in the past. This must be to the good of the community at large.<lb/>
There can often be confusion over voluntary agencies and volunteer groups. The volunteer groups give valuable support and assistance but are additional to the basic provision, and many of these are counselling services and self-help groups. Voluntary organisations with paid staff are very professional in their work, and match to some degree the pay and conditions of the statutory services. Their staff are often more committed and do without some of the benefits that the statutory organisations have. Many voluntary organisations do use volunteers. Where the organisations are good, they will carefully select and train these volunteers.<lb/>
There is great variation among voluntary welfare organisations. So often the voluntary sector helps to identify needs and pioneers new methods. There is a growing problem of glue sniffing and drug and alcohol abuse among young people. There is a great concern in the community over this. Voluntary support groups and organisations are growing like mushrooms. I was pleased that the Government had asked health and social service authorities to report by Christmas on the problems of their districts. The picture that they receive may not be a very full one. It sometimes takes a considerable time before addiction presents itself to an authority. There is a vital need for voluntary and statutory organisations to pool their knowledge and efforts to combat the cause and treat the conditions of the individual. Educational programmes for all who need and want them should be available. No effort should be spared as our youth of today are our backbone for tomorrow.<lb/>
Most of the residential rehabilitation facilities are provided by voluntary organisations, as is much of the day care and counselling in the drug scene. There is concern that grants will be lost for some of these vital welfare services when the metropolitan counties and the GLC go. Could the Minister give some assurance tonight that they will be safeguarded? Are the Government going to review their proposals for the funding of voluntary organisations?<lb/>
I should like to pay a tribute to many of the boys from youth custody establishments who work so well helping in residential, voluntary homes for handicapped people. These boys provide a very necessary service, and the co-operation between the Home Office establishments and the voluntary homes must be congenial. Last week, I was told of a boy from a youth custody establishment who had worked so well at a home to which he went out by the day that the director had offered him a job when he left. He is now in full employment doing an excellent and useful job. There is no doubt in my mind that good co-operation between voluntary welfare organisations and other bodies, putting aside professional pride, most effectively satisfies the needs of the community at large.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00599"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend's Question refers to the community at large. I hope she will forgive me if I refer in what I have to say to the community "at small" and to the needs of small communities and the relationship between those small communities and local authorities. I know that it is only part of the problem with which this very valuable Question is concerned but I believe it is an important part.<lb/>
The history of local authorities' involvement with the voluntary sector goes back as long as the history of local government. I do not propose to take the House that far back, but I should simply wish to observe two or three of the most important trends that have taken place in the last 20 years. The first was the introduction in two stages, first for London and then for the rest of the country, of much larger local authorities than had existed heretofore. Those larger local authorities found it difficult at the outset to maintain the local contact which their predecessors, the urban district councils, the rural district councils and so on, had succeeded in keeping with local communities. Some of them were very well aware of the difficulties they had in keeping contact with local community needs. I served on a London borough council at that time and it was the constant preoccupation of our larger committees, for the larger areas to retain the contact which our predecessor authorities had had.<lb/>
Recently there have been a number of initiatives in local government which have contributed to its ability to meet local community needs. They are not always well publicised&#x2014;in fact some of them are not publicised at all&#x2014;but I think it is worth making some reference to them. First, there has been a movement in some local authorities, particularly urban local authorities, to decentralise their welfare, housing and other personal social services. Boroughs such as Walsall have set up area offices which cover a very large part of the contact between the authority and local communities. They provide a much more convenient access to local services than used to be provided by travelling all the way to the town hall&#x2014;or the civic centre, as they are grandly called nowadays. There is no doubt that this kind of decentralisation has led to an increased awareness of local needs by the council and also to an increased demand for welfare services, because the two go very much together.<lb/>
Secondly, there has been a move in a number of local authorities towards new styles of governing. I shall not pick out particular examples of that, but there is a tendency towards having special committees alongside the operational committees to deal with the needs of women or the needs of ethnic minorities, and so on. I know that these bodies are very often laughed at and sometimes the grants they give are laughed at, but they perform a function of providing within local authorities a critique of the traditional ways in which local authorities, with their large budgets, have gone about their business. Also they provide another opportunity for local communities and those in need in local communities to make their views known to the local authority.<lb/>
<col>112</col>
The third type of change that is taking place was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock; that is, economic initiatives. I know that it is not the subject of the Question tonight, but many of the job creation activities of local authorities are not simply a matter of providing subsidies to private industry; they actively involve the voluntary sector. I think particularly of the City of Leeds, whose Estates and Industry Committee is providing a considerable amount of training for and with the voluntary sector&#x2014;training and financial encouragement for job creation activities by the voluntary sector.<lb/>
All these seem to me to be evidence that local authorities are aware of their limitations, of the problems they have by being really too large for community action, and of the possibilities that are open to them to make a real contribution together with the voluntary sector.<lb/>
Unfortunately, we come now onto the policy of the present Government towards local authorities. A number of noble Lords have referred to rate capping. If it were only that&#x2014;as the noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, said, it applies in the first instance only to 17 authorities&#x2014;that would not be too serious. But the history of the last five years has been the history of a series of attacks not just on local authority expenditure, but particularly on the ability of those local authorities who have the most of their population in need of both public and voluntary help to meet that need.<lb/>
The first series of attacks, soon after the 1979 election, was the fulfilment of an election pledge to transfer the resources of Government grant from the cities, and particularly from the inner city areas, to the shire counties. It was a conscious and explicit policy, but the result was that the resources of the local authorities in the areas of greatest need were that much less. Then, long before rate capping, we had the system of penalties being imposed; not just the withdrawal of grants, but actually penalising those local authorities which exceeded the Government's views of what should be spent. That may not seem on the face of it to be particularly aimed at the welfare services and the collaboration between the welfare services and the voluntary sector. But if we consider the proportion of local authority expenditure which is either tied down in the form of meeting debt charges and that part of local authority expenditure which is in fulfilment of statutory obligations laid on local authorities by Government, it can be seen that the welfare services which do not fall in either of those two categories are particularly at risk when there are penalties being imposed.<lb/>
Then we come to rate capping and it is not just 17 authorities with which we are concerned, but there is in the Rates Act the threat of general rate-capping powers to follow and I assume that the Government did not put those powers in lightly. I assume that they really meant to use them if they decided that, by whatever standards they applied, expenditure in other authorities was going to be excessive. That is a very severe threat, as some noble Lords have said, not just to expenditure on welfare services in collaboration with the voluntary sector, but on the security which the voluntary sector needs over a period of more than one year in order to make decisions about staffing and
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0065"/>
<col>113</col>
the obligations it takes on. The noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, made this point very effectively, and I believe it is critical to the harmonious working of the relationship between local authorities and the voluntary sector. So the rate capping is much more serious in potential than for the 17 authorities who are likely to be affected in the first instance.<lb/>
Finally, we have the Bill which is to come before Parliament in the next Session for the abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan authorities. This Bill itself is not intended to be an attack on the voluntary sector and is not intended to be an attack on the welfare services, but it is a fact that both the Greater London Council and a number of the metropolitan councils have made it part of their policy over the past years to extend the possibilities of grant to local communities and to contribute very substantially to the work of the voluntary sector through their grants policies. The noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, referred to a figure&#x2014;of which I was not aware and I am grateful to him for it&#x2014;of &#x00A3;173 million in grants from local authorities to the voluntary sector. That is a very large sum in relation to the amount of money which can be raised from charitable and other sources. It would be a very severe blow to the voluntary sector if the continuation of the Government's policies towards local authorities were to put that sum at risk.<lb/>
I know that the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, is personally sympathetic towards the welfare services and the voluntary sector. I hope that in his reply he will be able to show the House that in supporting those services he is not swimming vainly against the more powerful tide of the Government's continuing attack upon local authorities and local authority expenditure.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00601"><member>Lord Shackleton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for intervening in the debate at this late hour. However, I have been very moved by the debate and wish to congratulate my noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs for initiating it. May I also congratulate my noble friend and all those whose services to voluntary work are so great.<lb/>
My reason for intervening is partly because of the reference made by the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, in his interesting speech, to the amount of money provided by industry. I should like to speak from that standpoint. Almost on a weekly basis I have to decide how much money to give to what charity. I have also been stimulated to take part in the debate because of having seen today <i>A Guide to Company Giving</i>, published by the Directory of Social Change. It is made clear in that guide&#x2014;and it is important for people to realise it&#x2014;that the published figures are very incomplete.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Seear, who is to speak next in the debate, serves on one of the trusts which has been set up by my company. Excluding trusts, we give away between &#x00A3;300,000 and &#x00A3;400,000 a year. This does not include overseas gifts. This is an important figure but it is quite inadequate for the needs of the voluntary services today. We are flooded with requests. I am bound to say to the Government, who are apt to regard the public as thinking of the
<col>114</col>
Government as a milch cow, that industry is also regarded as a milch cow but that it does not have the resources to provide what is needed.<lb/>
May I give an example. The consequences of Government policy with regard to the universities and their research budgets have been serious shortfalls. There are now constant applications not just from bodies like the Salvation Army, which one regularly supports, but from other good causes. The very large number of applications which we have to turn down simply because we do not have the resources is terrifying. It is therefore important for the Government to realise that there is no substitute for the role of both Government and local authority in support of voluntary and charitable causes. Many of us in industry give a great deal of thought to it because we are worried about it. We have carried out investigations, and there are those who argue that industry should not be giving away shareholders' money&#x2014;that this money is not theirs to give.<lb/>
I was glad to hear my noble friend Lord Longford quote the views of my old boss Herbert Morrison on charity. I believe that corporate activities should act as good citizens. It is in the interests of both our employees in industry and of our shareholders that causes such as the Salvation Army should be supported. But industry provides only a fraction of the money that is needed. Much more is provided by sponsorship schemes, a great many of which are not included in any published figures.<lb/>
May I add that the company with which I was previously involved, the John Lewis Partnership, never sought publicity or any return for its altruism. It simply took the view that it was in our best interests as citizens that we should live in a good society. But it is no good expecting industry or the private individual to replace the role which the Government and local authorities should play in this field.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00602">10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00603"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this late hour the House will be looking first and foremost for brevity. But may I say, in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for launching this debate, that she has in fact raised a vast question. It has been raised in the form of an Unstarred Question but it is an issue which needs a great deal of thorough investigation; indeed, some kind of Select Committee would not be inappropriate for examining the implications of the matters which have been raised tonight.<lb/>
The fact is that we are in the midst of a major change in social policy. In the years immediately following the Beveridge Report and the reforms of the Attlee Government, the welfare state was taking on vast responsibilities. Voluntary bodies then were seen as entirely marginal to the main work of maintaining the wellbeing of the individual. There has been a change for a variety of reasons, which I am certainly not going into at this time of night. But I believe it is widely accepted that what we now need is a partnership between the statutory and the voluntary bodies. We are not going back to the purely welfare state approach but are moving on to what Beveridge always said he wanted: not a welfare state but a welfare society. As I
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0066"/>
<col>115</col>
see it, that means collaboration between the statutory and the voluntary agencies, with a great deal of local and neighbourhood initiative support for the services which people require.<lb/>
If that is true, it is no use tinkering with the kind of way in which the voluntary bodies have been financed in the past. All those of us who are involved in voluntary bodies know that they are extremely hard up. I serve on a number of various committees and seem to spend all my time trying to find ways to raise money. It seems to me that the committees never do very much of the work they are meant to do because they are forever devoting their time to chasing money. Personally, I dare not sign any more letters to either trusts or companies asking for money because I have done so much of that in the past. I am sure that goes for everybody in your Lordships' House.<lb/>
We need to take a fundamental look at the financial implications and the tax implications of the collaboration between government and voluntary bodies. The noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, raised the question of VAT on charities; that is just one part of it. There is also the whole question of encouragement for giving by both individuals and public bodies of one kind or another. We need to explore in a much more fundamental way the financial implications of the kind of partnership about which we all talk so glibly.<lb/>
The only other thing I want to do tonight is to cheat somewhat by raising an issue which might have been more appropriate for the previous debate. It concerns the voluntary bodies in relation to employment and job creation. Much of this flows over. There is no hard and fast line between the job creation activities of voluntary bodies and many of their other activities. Many of the community projects for job creation also involve the provision of services of the kind which could well have been provided in the past by statutory bodies. So there is not a sharp distinction between what the voluntary bodies do in the area of welfare services and what the voluntary bodies do in connection with job creation. The two flow into one another and should be seen as a whole.<lb/>
This involves people of a quite different kind and in a very different economic position from the people who in the past were associated with voluntary bodies. As we all know, there is a vast number of unemployed people. Those of us who have been connected with the voluntary project programme of the MSC know that it uses unemployed people and creates opportunities for unemployed people to contribute work of value to the community. That is a fine idea, but it does not pay their expenses. It is not very much good telling unemployed people that they can be of use to the community if they are going to be out of pocket in the process. Therefore, there are a number of ways in which we need to re-think how we are using people who are now available for voluntary service.<lb/>
I know that we need to keep the voluntary element, but these schemes would be so much more effective if it were possible to offer some kind of greater financial assistance to the people who take part in them. This need not be a wage, but at least out-of-pocket expenses of a reasonably generous kind.<lb/>
<col>116</col>
The other point I want to make on collaboration between statutory and voluntary in the community project area is that if these schemes are to be successful&#x2014;and some of them have been very imaginative and creative&#x2014;they must be allowed to have some security and some continuity. The way in which in the past the MSC has agreed to help for only one year is making it almost impossible to run these schemes in a sensible way. One cannot expect people of any competence to run these schemes which provide job creation and services in the community if they have the expectation of working for only a year. Nor, in my opinion, is it sensible to take people from unemployment knowing one has to get rid of them at the end of the year.<lb/>
The fact is that the people running the schemes, naturally, as they get towards the end of the first year and probably about halfway through a scheme, are busily looking around for something else to do. That is no way to run effective schemes of this sort. I want to see&#x2014;and I fly this idea as a kite this evening&#x2014;community projects very carefully and professionally vetted, before they are accepted and financed, by people who know about the particular kind of work that is to be done. They should then be told that unless something goes disastrously wrong they will be financed for, say, 10 years&#x2014;some people may say that that is a little too long&#x2014;but that the money given to them will be gradually reduced over that 10-year period. They will then know that there is to be continuity.<lb/>
If we really want community schemes to work, then in the interests of people with very little financial resources who can now contribute in the same way as people who did voluntary work previously but who did not need that kind of assistance, there must be financial resources and continuity. There must be the certainty that if they are making a success of a project the assistance will continue for a reasonable period of time.<lb/>
I am trying briefly to say that we are feeling our way towards a new kind of relationship and a new kind of work to be done by collaboration between the voluntary and statutory sectors. We shall not find the answers just by making a small change here and a small change there. We need to take a fundamental look at the sort of relationship we want to see and at all the financial and tax implications of developing that relationship properly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00604">10.8 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00605"><member>Baroness Jeger</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs has put the House in her debt tonight by raising this very important subject. I am sure that the House appreciated the wisdom and experience of all who have spoken. My noble friend Lady Ewart-Biggs, we all know, gives very unselfishly of her time, as do many other Members of your Lordships' House, and so they are speaking from practical knowledge.<lb/>
The subject raised by my noble friend goes far beyond the limitations of tonight's debate and I will not weary the House by trying to deal with all aspects of this complicated subject. I am sure that the Minister will be relieved to hear that. I support what the noble
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0067"/>
<col>117</col>
Baroness, Lady Seear, said about a Select Committee, or some other machinery for further investigation, being set up so that we can go beyond tonight's debate into what should be a very serious study which reflects all the fundamental social changes in our society.<lb/>
When some of us were young, good works were rather the prerogative of what used to be called the gentry. They used to be married ladies who did not go out to work in the sense of paid work. Now the whole pattern of life has changed. We have to involve all ranks of society in activities which need to be nearer to good neighbourliness and good social understanding, rather than in any kind of patronising, charitable work in which so many of these organisations originated in the last century. Everybody recognises that those days are over.<lb/>
However, if we are to put that recognition into effect, we must take some steps towards fundamental changes in the allocation of responsibility, in taxation and in matters such as VAT, to which the noble Baroness referred. We must try to find this very difficult balance between statutory duties of the Government and voluntary work which individuals can do. I think it is very important to try to work out where the emphasis must be. In my experience it is very important to start off with some pump-priming, so that an organisation is helped to start.<lb/>
Then we have to ask the Minister what is happening about the Voluntary Services Unit at the Home Office and what view they can take of longer-term help. Other speakers have referred to the fact that it is really difficult when an organisation or an individual knows that there is only to be one year's help and then it is to be reviewed. That is no way to encourage people to give of their time and ability. It is no way to run an efficient organisation. I do not think anyone who is experienced in business would try to run a chip shop on that basis.<lb/>
Who is to have the future responsibility? The noble Baroness, Lady Faithfull, whose knowledge we all respect, raised this as a very important point. There is no doubt&#x2014;and we have all been speaking away from party politics tonight&#x2014;that there is the gravest anxiety among the voluntary organisations about the results of the Government's policies on rate capping, and the changes which are to be made in local authority responsibilities. It is no use Ministers thinking that those who express these anxieties are taking a purely party point of view, because I have had representations, as I am sure have all Members of this House, from people of all political views, and those of no political views at all, who are deeply anxious about the future of the work that they are trying to do.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Longford, was absolutely right to stress that there is a very real nervousness among the voluntary bodies who see a reduction in social spending which is going to make their work more difficult. I am sure we were all impressed with the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who herself does so much work in this sphere. I absolutely agree with her that the voluntary agencies must not be regarded as a cheap option for statutory services which are trying to make economies. That is most dispiriting to people who are prepared to give their time and ability.<lb/>
<col>118</col>
It does not do much good for a bright-eyed young boy or girl who is prepared to help in some way in the community to begin by having a collecting box thrust in his or her hand and being told that he or she has to organise a coffee morning or run a jumble sale. That is not going to get these schemes off the ground. The voluntary organisations depend on people who give of their time, ability and kindliness. They should not have to be diverted to such a large extent into raising funds which are necessary. That causes a loss of spirit among the people involved and does not make for their full potential being used in the way that is most useful. So much of the work does not show, and it is often very difficult for organisations to present themselves in a way most favourable to those who are more concerned with the financial aspect of things. There are, for instance, many societies which cross local authority boundaries. They are particularly worried about what is to happen if one local authority continues sympathetic to their work while the one next door is capricious and takes a different view. This is a point that needs to be taken on board.<lb/>
I know that there are many examples which all of us could quote. I shall just mention one. We have in London a very enterprising voluntary organisation called dial-a-ride. This is inventive and new. It is largely run by young people, partly, I think, because young people like driving. It is a scheme by which people who are house-bound can telephone and ask for transport. It has enabled hundreds of them to visit a theatre, attend a concert or just to go for a ride for the sake of getting out of the house. It is the sort of organisation which must be a growing point. It involves young people. It contributes so much by way of its money's worth in the return that the people who benefit from it enjoy.<lb/>
I hope the Minister will be able to answer some of the questions. I do not envy him his job tonight. I hope, however, that he will be able to put many anxieties at rest. Where there are detailed questions that cannot be answered tonight, I know that he will study them further. I hope, in particular, he will stress to his ministerial colleagues the views of many in this House that a Select Committee or some other way of earning forward tonight's necessarily short debate can be established.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00606">10.17 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00607"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly echo the views of all those who have expressed gratitude to the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for raising this important matter this evening. I do so because the Government have always recognised that the contribution of the voluntary sector is an essential complement and supplement to the work of the statutory services. I would be the first to agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chichester about their long history in this field. A significant feature of the Government's policy has been to encourage greater co-operation between the statutory and voluntary sectors. As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Services said when addressing the social services conference at Buxton recently, the increasing pressures which we face in the health and personal social services make it essential for
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0068"/>
<col>119</col>
us to seek the most effective use of all the resources that can be brought to bear on them. It is a matter of common sense, therefore, to stimulate and support the efforts of the voluntary sector, as nearly all those who have spoken tonight have advocated, to extend the services provided to patients and clients as well as to the unseen army of carers who carry the burden of looking after elderly or handicapped relatives, friends and neighbours.<lb/>
I must first mention, as the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, indicated&#x2014;and it is a matter to which other speakers have also referred&#x2014;that the Home Office's voluntary services unit is the body with overall responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's interest in the field of voluntary services. My noble friend Lady Faithfull, the noble Earl, Lord Longford, and the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, suggested that an individual Minister should be responsible. Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Longford, anticipated some of the difficulties of actually attaching a handle nominally to any particular Minister who might have this responsibility. I think that all those who have spoken would perhaps like to know that the Minister with responsibility in this area is my honourable friend Mr. Waddington. He is the Minister with particular responsibility there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00608"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in practice, how does that work out? If one is trying, as many bodies do try, to obtain help from a number of different departments, where does the Home Office Minister come in?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00609"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I can just continue with what I was going to say, I hope that might be clear to the noble Earl in a moment. While not superseding the close links which individual voluntary organisations have with the Government departments with which they deal, the Voluntary Services Unit is the core funding body for organisations whose activities cover the interests of several departments, for example, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Volunteer Centre. Organisations like these provide the essential networks for Government initiatives in the voluntary sector. These bodies, such as the NCVO and the Volunteer Centre, do liaise with all departments as my noble friend Lady Faithfull would like them to do.<lb/>
Of course, my department and the Department of the Environment also liaise directly with the Home Office, which is what I think the noble Earl is asking me to confirm. My department has, of course, the major interest in organisations active in the health and personal social services field. Our commitment to such organisations is demonstrated by the fact that we have increased our financial aid to these organisations from &#x00A3;10 million in 1979&#x2013;80 to about &#x00A3;34 million this year.<lb/>
The largest single element is our general scheme of grants under Section 64 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968. Section 64 grants are usually made to help meet the central costs of national voluntary organisations, but they can also be made to help fund local innovatory projects which have potential national application. This year we have made &#x00A3;11.5 million available for grants under this
<col>120</col>
scheme compared with &#x00A3;10.2 million last year and we are helping 220 organisations. It has been suggested that three-year grants make much more sense across the board than one-year grants. I quite agree with that view, and indeed more and more Section 64 grants are now given on a three-year basis.<lb/>
In addition to our general support under Section 64, we have launched a number of initiatives and programmes in areas of particular social need. It might be helpful if I describe some of these, or at least some of the more important ones. Time will not permit me to go into them all, nor will time allow me to comment on the many schemes such as the Red Cross, which was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham; although I should certainly like to pay tribute to her and all those others in your Lordships' House and elsewhere who have such a high reputation and do so much work in the voluntary sector.<lb/>
To start with the youngest, we have made &#x00A3;6 million available to 1986&#x2013;87 for an under-fives initiative, to help stimulate voluntary sector provision for disadvantaged families with pre-school children. Fifteen major voluntary child care organisations are involved in managing some 110 projects with support from initiative funds all over England.<lb/>
Also in the field of child care, the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisations has, with grant-aid and help from the DHSS, mounted a series of regional seminars. The theme of these seminars, and the purpose in setting them up, is to consider local authority child care needs and the way voluntary organisations and local authorities can work together to provide these in a more cost-effective way.<lb/>
In the field of mental handicap, too, voluntary bodies play a prominent part in helping to provide for the needs of mentally handicapped people and their families and for exploring new ways of helping to help them in the community. My department helps many of these voluntary bodies through our scheme of Section 64 grants, ranging from large ones like MENCAP to smaller ones like "Contact a Family". As part of the children's initiative, which aims to get all mentally handicapped children out of long-stay hospitals, we have made available &#x00A3;1 million on a &#x00A3;1-for-&#x00A3;1 basis to voluntary bodies to help with the capital and setting-up costs of providing care in the community. Seven projects have been funded in this way.<lb/>
I should like to refer briefly to the intermediate treatment initiative which was announced in January 1983 and designed to promote close relationships between the voluntary and statutory sectors. The Government have provided substantial resources&#x2014;some &#x00A3;15 million over three years&#x2014;for setting up new intensive intermediate treatment facilities for use by courts as alternatives to custody or residential care for juvenile offenders. Local authorities were asked to designate voluntary bodies which could provide such facilities for them in their areas. The voluntary organisations&#x2014;some national, some local and some newly-created locally&#x2014;run the facilities under inter-agency management committees.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Masham. referred to drug misuse&#x2014;a subject about which we all feel strongly, and rightly so. In response to this growing problem we
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0069"/>
<col>121</col>
have made available &#x00A3;7 million over three years to encourage health and local authorities and voluntary organisations to bring forward more quickly than might otherwise have been possible projects for the provision or improvement of services for drug misusers.<lb/>
Voluntary organisations have traditionally played an important role in providing services for this particular group, which is not always a popular one, and over &#x00A3;2 million has already been approved for 39 projects submitted by voluntary bodies. Under the initiative, the department needs to be satisfied that proposals from voluntary organisations have been discussed with relevant health and social services authorities and that these authorities will in appropriate cases give consideration to future funding. The guidelines on the initiative remind the statutory authorities that they have powers to make grants and second staff to voluntary bodies.<lb/>
We have also asked health authorities to assess the prevalence of drug misuse in their areas in consultation with local authorities, voluntary organisations and others, and to report by the end of the year on their plans for urgent action to tackle this problem. As your Lordships will know, my right honourable friend the Minister for Health announced on 10th October a proposal to commit &#x00A3;5 million more to expand our efforts in prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.<lb/>
The voluntary sector also has a central part to play in the development of additional community care facilities. Under the joint finance scheme health authorities can support personal social services, provision of education for disabled people and housing. As part of the Care in the Community initiative we have given health authorities greater freedom to transfer their funds with a view to getting out of hospital long-stay patients who would be more appropriately cared for in the community. We look to health authorities to develop a partnership with voluntary organisations and to carry out an enabling role&#x2014;mobilising the total resources of the community, including formal and informal voluntary service.<lb/>
As a concrete move towards involving voluntary organisations in the planning and operation of health and community services, and to demonstrate the Government's resolve, we changed the law to give voluntary organisations representation as of right on joint consultative committees of health and local authorities. Arrangments should be completed by 1st January. The choice of representatives is to be made entirely by the voluntary organisations themselves, and we hope that this will lead to fuller participation by voluntary organisations at all levels.<lb/>
As part of the Care in the Community initiative, we are providing additional finance for a programme of pilot projects designed to show how Care in the Community can be made a reality. Almost all of the 13 projects selected for the first round involve some form of voluntary effort, including housing associations. We shall be watching these projects closely to see how, among other things, collaboration
<col>122</col>
with voluntary organisations develops, and what lessons can be learned for future projects.<lb/>
The noble Baroness, Lady Seear, raised the problems of employment and job creation, and their connection with the voluntary sector. Through our successful Opportunities for Volunteering Scheme we are channelling &#x00A3;5 million a year through national voluntary organisations to local voluntary projects. The projects, of which over 1,000 have been supported since the scheme was launched in 1982, cover the whole range of local health and social services activities and look like enabling 40,000 volunteers, mostly unemployed people, to make a contribution to the health and welfare of their fellow citizens. I hope that this might go some way towards replying to the remarks which the noble Baroness made about job creation and employment, but I should like to study the remarks that she made and write to her.<lb/>
Under our new helping the community to care programme, which I do not think has been mentioned tonight and which was announced in July, we are making available &#x00A3;10.5 million over the next three years primarily to assist the voluntary sector. I shall not repeat what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Social Services has already said, but this programme is aimed at enabling volunteers, families, neighbours and others to provide informal care more effectively and with greater confidence. Part of the money will be earmarked for the preparation of information and training materials for carers and to provide training courses for voluntary workers in specific fields; and part will be directed to the mounting of a number of demonstration projects. Some of the schemes will be focused on particular problems&#x2014;for example, training for participants in "home from hospital" schemes for elderly people: training for those providing care in the community for mentally handicapped people: and the development of models for co-ordinating after-care for schizophrenic patients.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00610"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask the Minister who will be the trainers of the carers for these schemes? In the Red Cross that is what we are interested in. We are short of trainers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00611"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I note the point which the noble Baroness makes. I am not quite sure what the answer is, but perhaps I can let her know.<lb/>
Other schemes in this particular field are of a more general nature. Each of the schemes is being carried out at present with voluntary organisations who will be managing different parts of the programme. We will announce details of the various schemes as they are settled.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, raised the matter of the urban programme. For the urban programme as a whole about &#x00A3;50 million went to the voluntary sector in 1982&#x2013;83 and for 1983&#x2013;84 more than &#x00A3;62 million was allocated. Three-quarters of all
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0070"/>
<col>123</col>
local authority spending on approved urban programme projects is paid for by central Government grants. Quite understandably, much of this debate has focused on the concern felt by those who fear the Government's proposals to abolish the GLC and the MCCs&#x2014;and indeed the effect of rate-capping&#x2014;and I should now like to make a few points on that.<lb/>
It is the Government's firm desire that worthwhile voluntary activity should not be harmed by abolition. The recent consultation paper contained proposals for helping local authorities in the abolition areas take on the increased financial responsibility for supporting the voluntary sector. These include providing a statutory basis for collective grant-giving where a voluntary body serves an area wider than one local authority; where, although the organisation is essentially a local one, it has previously been funded wholly or partly by the GLC or a metropolitan county council, the Government are proposing to provide transitional support of &#x00A3;5 million a year for four years to meet up to 75 per cent. of the cost of a grant made by an individual borough or metropolitan district council.<lb/>
On the question of rate-capping, I can of course understand the concern which was expressed&#x2014;perhaps particularly by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock&#x2014;that local authority funding for voluntary bodies might be cut back as a result of rate-capping. My noble friend Lady Faithfull referred to this as well. It was for that very reason that provision was made in the Rates Act for a local authority to apply for its funding for charities to be considered as a ground for redetermining its expenditure level. The fact remains that so far no such application has been made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00612"><member>Lord McIntosh of Haringey</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Will he agree that the proposal that he has just described is a good deal less effective and comprehensive than the exemption of expenditure on charitable bodies, which was carried by this House and then overturned by the Government at a later stage?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00613"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that I could usefully follow the noble Lord down the road which he seeks to take me at the moment on this theme. Perhaps I may say that the Rates Act makes ample provision for any authority which considers that it cannot live within the expenditure level determined for it to apply for such a redetermination. If, however, an authority chooses not to apply for a redetermination, we can only assume that it does not do so because it considers that it can live within the external limit determined for it, and then the Secretary of State is denied that opportunity to have regard to contributions to charities in reaching a decision as to the authority's expenditure level.<lb/>
It would be wrong for the Secretary of State to be able to dictate the detailed destination of local authority funds or the amount local authorities should donate to funding charitable organisations. That is a
<col>124</col>
matter for local decision. My noble friend Lord Bellwin said on 18th June at column 76:
<quote>"where an authority was considering cutting its support to charities because of the pressures of the expenditure level, the charities concerned would be in a strong position to press the council to apply for a redetermination simply because of this amendment".</quote>
I am sure that it is the right course for them to take in present circumstances. The selected authorities' failure to apply arises, I believe, largely from political motives, regardless of whether they think they have found a sound financial case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00614"><member>Baroness Faithfull</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when this point was discussed under the Rates Bill several of us&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, being one&#x2014;asked whether local voluntary organisations could be informed that they could apply to the Secretary of State if they were cut and whether he would consider the financial position of the local authority. The Minister later said that he could not send out letters such as that to the voluntary organisations. Therefore it is not surprising that nothing has been received because the voluntary organisations know nothing of this.<lb/>
Secondly, when the Minister says that Mr. Waddington has overall responsibility, has Mr. Waddington responsibility over local authorities which have refused voluntary organisations their grants?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00615"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, regarding the first question, for obvious reasons I have not in front of me the relevant quotations for all the debates which took place in your Lordships' House. I shall study my noble friend's points and let her know the answer, and I shall read the remarks to see what was said on those occasions. As she indicated, the debate goes far wider than just the DHSS, the Home Office, or indeed the Department of the Environment.<lb/>
My noble friend went on to ask whether or not my honourable friend Mr. Waddington would be in a position to negotiate with local authorities in the way that she wants. The Home Office would liaise with the Department of the Environment in this case. Exactly what the mechanism is I cannot tell my noble friend, but I shall look into it and communicate with her.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00616"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord also write to me about the specific question I asked him on the precise mechanism of the operation of Section 3(9)?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00617"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly shall.<lb/>
I have described a number of particular programmes and initiatives in some detail because it is important to emphasise the relationship between the statutory and voluntary sectors and the role of central Government in stimulating and improving that relationship. We shall continue to explore new ways of strengthening these relationships. It seems to me from what has been said this evening that there is a general wish that these relationships should be strengthened&#x2014;and strengthened to the benefit of the community at large.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0071"/>
<col>125</col>
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State gave an indication of the way we hope the social services departments will develop their role of enabling, seeking the most effective use of all the resources of the community to help those who need support. He said this in his speech last month at the social services conference at Buxton.<lb/>
My right honourable friend is now considering the form of a consultative document to promote a wider debate and I hope that that, at least, will give comfort to the noble Lord, Lord Shackleton, who raised a point not dissimilar from it.<lb/>
There is a need for more work to be done before it can be truly said that the needs of the community are fully or most effectively being met, but I am confident that we are moving in the right direction in seeking new ways of mobilising the vast resources which have been referred to tonight which are represented by the voluntary sector in the community.<lb/>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00620"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Glenarthur)</member>: Earlier this year the Government increased their grant to the Health Education Council by half a million pounds in order to finance additional anti-smoking activity. The grant for the current year is &#x00A3;9.1 million, and a significant proportion is being devoted to programmes aimed at discouraging smoking. A new media campaign on this subject is being planned by the council for the spring of 1985.</p>

<title>Death by Reckless Driving: Disqualification</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00623"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00624">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00625">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will introduce legislation to amend Section 93 of the Road Traffic Act 1972 so as to ensure that persons convicted of causing death by reckless driving are disqualified for at least three years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00626"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government agree that there should be severe penalties for those who are guilty of recklessly killing and injuring others on our roads. We have no present plans to change this particular law, but my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport has been giving further thought to the subject of road traffic law generally and hopes to make an announcement shortly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00627"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply. Would he agree that we are not talking about death caused by careless driving but of death caused by deliberate reckless driving, often under the influence of drink or drugs? This being the case, can he visualise any circumstances in which disqualification for as much as three years for this grave offence would be excessive?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00628"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the average disqualification is, in fact, of three years. The last available figures were those for 1982, during which 251 people were convicted of causing death by reckless driving. The vast majority of those people were disqualified, 67 per cent. of them for periods of three years and over. Nearly half those convicted were also given prison sentences, mostly of up to 12 months but in some cases longer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00629"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord not feel that this sort of proposal casts an unwarranted reflection on the competence of the judiciary? Can we not really assume that they are in a better position to judge the appropriate sentence, when they know all the circumstances, than we who know none of them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00630"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would agree. Only the courts have access to all the relevant facts of a particular case. They will therefore be in the best position to make judgments appropriate to those facts. The Magistrates' Association does issue to benches its own suggestions on appropriate sentences for magistrates' courts; and the Lord Chief Justice has
<col>128</col>
recently called for severe sentences, including prison, for those who kill because of drink or extreme recklessness.</membercontribution></p>

<title>The Miners' Strike: Fines</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00631">2.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00632"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00633">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00634">To ask Her Majesty's Government what has been the total of fines levied on the 6,000 pickets who have been arrested in the current miners' dispute. what percentage of these fines have been paid, and how many fines have been less than &#x00A3;5.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00635"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. the information which is available about the 7,318 pickets arrested up to 16th October is not exactly in the form which my noble friend asks for. However, I can tell him that fines for offences committed in England and Wales in connection with the dispute have been imposed on 1,244 people at the following levels:<lb/>
Six people have been fined under &#x00A3;10; 94 people have been fined from &#x00A3; 10 to &#x00A3;24; 167 from &#x00A3;25 to &#x00A3;49; 226 from &#x00A3;50 to &#x00A3;74; 332 from &#x00A3;75 to &#x00A3;99; 265 from &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;149; 50 from &#x00A3;150 to &#x00A3;199; and 104 people have been fined &#x00A3;200 and above. The cost of finding out the percentage of those fines that have been paid would be disproportionate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00636"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether one of the factors in setting the level of fines is the amount of damage done to public property that will have to be met by taxpayers from all over the country? Is it true, as reported, that the current rate is &#x00A3;14 a day for Scargill's private army plus travel expenses? Is it true therefore that at the lowest end some of these pickets are making a very handsome profit out of the operation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00637"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not for Her Majesty's Government to comment on the decisions of individual courts in individual cases. The decision as to what is an appropriate fine in any case must belong entirely to the courts. In making it, they are required under Section 35 of the Magistates' Courts Act 1980 to have regard to the means of offenders so far as they are known.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00638"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord the Minister care to make it abundantly clear to the House&#x2014;if it is not transparently obvious already&#x2014;that to try and judge statistics in regard to criminal offences without knowing the nature of the offence, without knowing the mitigating circumstances or matters relevant to previous character, would be thoroughly injudicious, mischievous and misleading?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00639"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is, as I say, not for Her Majesty's Government to decide on what the courts ought to award in any individual case. But my noble friend of course had an absolute right to ask the substantive Question that stood in his name.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0073"/>
<col>129</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00640"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the duty of the court to award compensation where appropriate is scarcely dependent at all upon the factors mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00641"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware of that fact, but I think that we are discussing fines and not compensation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00642"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord agree that the use of such phrases as "Scargill's private army" reflects more upon the noble Lord who uses them than upon anyone else?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00643"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that anyone who reflects upon the circumstances will regard them as unfortunate and unconstitutional, but the bounds of the Question on the Order Paper forbid us debating that matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00644"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether Her Majesty's Government are reviewing the state of the law in regard to these disturbances and whether they think that the law at present is adequate or that the police are necessarily the best people to deal with it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00645"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the state of the law as regards public order has been under review for some time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00646"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister say what percentage of the arrested pickets were themselves miners by trade?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00647"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my information is that the number arrested who are miners is 6,828, which is about 93 per cent. of all those arrested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00648"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord opposite seems to abhor statistics, but surely it would be in our interests to have some statistics. Is it not rather ridiculous that 2,000 miners from as far away as Durham turned up at a very small pit in Yorkshire this morning in order to picket one man who wished to exercise his right to go to work?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00649"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, Her Majesty's Government have strong views on these matters, but they are not on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00650"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if we are to have statistics, might they include the very large number of miners who are now threatened with dismissal?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Overseas Aid as a Proportion of GNP</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00652">2.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00653"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<col>130</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00654">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00655">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether it is still their intention to attain the 0.7 per cent. of gross national product target for overseas aid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00656"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we remain committed to the United Nations target but, like the previous Government, we are not prepared to set a date for achieving it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00657"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, do not the latest figures show a still further decline in the provision of aid as a percentage of GNP and has not that proportion declined, while this Government have been in office, from 0.52 per cent. to 0.35 per cent.? Are we not, year by year, going in the wrong direction? Is not this a shameful situation in contrast to the European countries, most of which have a very much better record than we have? In the cases of France and the Scandinavian countries, they have already attained the 0.7 UN target. Should we not be reversing the situation and going upwards rather than downwards?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00658"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is true that our aid as a percentage of GNP has fallen since 1979 but I think the figure for that year&#x2014;0.52 per cent., which the noble Lord refered to&#x2014;was exceptionally high for reasons unrelated to the actual level of expenditure. The reason is that the OECD count our aid to the World Bank when we deposit notes at the Bank of England and not when the World Bank actually spends the money. This causes year to year fluctuations in our measured performance. We have consistently exceeded the 1 per cent. UN target with a total of official and private flows. In 1983 the amount was 1.25 per cent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00659"><member>Lord Bauer</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what is the point of such a target? Should not the size of our aid programme depend on its effectiveness and on our economic situation and not on an arbitrary figure derived from the Pearson Report of 1968?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00660"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I certainly think that our aid budget ought to be determined in accordance with the funds that we have available to support it, and, indeed, in accordance with the effect to which those funds are put, as my noble friend says. As to the existence of a target, although we have had to make the observations which we have about reaching that target&#x2014;which incidentally were made by our predecessors in exactly the same way&#x2014;it does perhaps serve a useful purpose with some of the more laggardly nations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00661"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord recall that last Thursday his noble friend Lord Lucas, in answering a Question from me, indicated that the Government, by refusing to give aid and assistance to a tender from British Aerospace, were losing both the contract for Britain and the employment that would have been so provided? Can he tell the House whether it is not the case that British overseas aid provides employment in Britain, and can he say by how much that employment has been<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0074"/>
<col>131</col>
reduced as a result of the reduction of British overseas aid since 1979? Secondly, can he tell the House why it is that the British Government believe they are unable to provide this money because of the world recession when, for instance, the Dutch Government, who are also suffering from the world recession, have now surpassed not just 0.7 per cent. but 1 per cent. of their country's GNP?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00662"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may say so, I think that the noble Lord oversimplifies these matters. It is possible to suggest&#x2014;although it is by no means proven&#x2014;that money spent overseas or granted overseas for aid purposes finds its way back to our economy, but I hope the noble Lord will not overlook the fact that that money in fact came from the British taxpayer in the first place and therefore has been taken out of the economy anyway.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00663"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to a Question yesterday the Minister expressed his deep and genuine concern about conditions in Ethiopia at the moment. Would he accept that it would be a practical expression of that concern if a more determined effort was made to increase the aid funds from the United Kingdom Government and to attain the target of 0.7 per cent. of GDP? Is he further aware that at the end of the war, when this country was devastated, we committed 1 per cent. of our GDP to overseas assistance to less fortunate countries, and would he suggest that moral standards have declined since those days?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00664"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no; I do not think the moral standards of today are any lower than the moral standards of other times. But I do believe that we must determine our aid budget in accordance with the resources that we can make available from the Government's resources generally. I do not think we have done at all badly with regard to aid. The figure for the last couple of years has shown a modest increase and I hope very much that we shall be able to continue that, although I could not guarantee it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00665"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, reverting to the question that was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Bauer, and the answer which the Minister gave to him, is it not perfectly reasonable that the United Nations and UNCTAD should use a percentage of the GNP as the proper yardstick for measuring a country's performance in these matters? Is not the GNP the measure of the resources that are available, to which the Minister referred?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00666"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the figure for which the noble Lord has asked me, and the one which I have given, is, as the noble Lord knows, the percentage of GNP constituted by official development assistance. We in this country, as it happens largely for historical reasons, actually provide very substantial sums for similar purposes from private sources, and that is the figure to which I also referred a little later in my answer.</membercontribution></p>
<col>132</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00667"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord be so courteous as to answer the question which I asked and which was also asked by my noble friend Lord Oram? Why is it that he continues with this gramophone record, saying that we cannot afford it and that we have to tailor our aid according to our resources, when on the continent of Europe, in similar circumstances, that aid has been increased despite the recession?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00668"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not responsible for what countries on the continent of Europe do, but I can say that our predecessors failed to have regard to the level of our resources, and look at the mess that they got us into!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00669"><member>Lord Jacques</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister bear in mind that the previous Government did not have the advantage of &#x00A3;10,000 million in oil taxation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00670"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the disadvantages of the previous Adminstration would take me rather longer to recite than Question Time allows.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Privacy and Media Coverage</title>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00672"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00673">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00674">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they believe that pictures on television and in newspapers of victims of bomb attacks being extricated from rubble amount to an unwarrantable invasion into privacy and ought not to be permitted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00675"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government believe that even in this sensitive area editorial decisions must in the first instance be a matter for the broadcasters and the press themselves, though they can be reviewed by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Press Council in the light of complaints from those who believe that their privacy has been unwarrantably infringed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00676"><member>Lord Airedale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged for that Answer, but are there not intensities of pain, distress and suffering which are such that one has to say, "This person on this occasion must be allowed to suffer in private and not under the public gaze"? Can we really trust the whole of the media always to respect this right to privacy?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00677"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the press and the broadcasters have a clear responsibility to take account of the reasonable susceptibilities of the public, of the dignity and privacy of those who are the victims of this type of outrage and of the need to convey the horror of what has happened. The BBC, the IBA and the Press Council have their own guidelines on the portrayal of violence and suffering. I would hope that reporters and photographers would do unto those whom they observe as they would wish them to do unto them.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0075"/>
<col>133</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00678"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that standards of good taste at editorial level, whether it be in the national press or on television or radio, have to many of us dropped considerably? Is it not the hope of all of us that those standards will be looked at by the persons concerned?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00679"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the advantage of having the bodies to which I have referred is that they can be aware of the expression of opinion which your Lordships so powerfully make.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00680"><member>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend agree that those responsible for the particularly intrusive medium of television frequently give the impression that they are more concerned to excite and to entertain than they are to show regard for the individual, no matter how painful the circumstances?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00681"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in this delicate area there are established bodies which are in position in order to oversee these matters, and it is not for the Government to make pronouncements on them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00682"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while I sympathise with the noble Lord's Question, would the noble Lord, Lord Elton, agree that in this particular case it was perhaps necessary to bring home to the public the true horror of the situation in order that it should be taken seriously?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00683"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is right that there is a balance to be struck here. The privacy of the individual and standards of good taste must at all times be considered. But the nation itself needs to see the degree of horror of some of the deeds committed against it. That is the only qualification that I would put on what I said previously.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00684"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to ask my noble friend the Minister whether Her Majesty's Government have any plans to put the Press Council on a proper statutory basis, because in many quarters there is much dissatisfaction as to the way in which it has worked over the past five or 10 years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00685"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships have turned your attention to the Press Council on a number of occasions in the last few years. At present I am not aware of any intention to revise the situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00686"><member>Lord Broxbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend has referred to guidelines. While these may be very useful and persuasive in their way, is there not a case for them being reinforced with something a little more realistic and substantial in the form of sanctions? Will the Government give consideration to the possibility of a review of that position?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00687"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Press Council is not a statutory body and it does not have sanctions available to it in the same sense as the other two bodies have, which can require publication of their findings. As to guidelines, I am certain that it will be aware of what has been said today because I shall ensure that copies of your Lordships' proceedings are sent to the council,<lb/>
<col>134</col>
and it will be able to consider those in conjunction with its guidelines.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00688"><member>Lord Hunt</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister agree that it would be no bad thing if the Press Council and the Broadcasting Complaints Council gave a clear definition of what is proper in the public interest and what may be of interest to the inquisitive instincts and inclinations of certain members of the public which are pandered to in order to sell newspapers and to make people turn on their television sets?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00689"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the difficulty as I see it is that whereas all of us, when we see something in print or on the screen, have a clear view as to its moral position&#x2014;whether or not it is intrusive or offensive&#x2014;it is very difficult to put that into cold print. I suspect that what your Lordships are in fact in part saying is that you do not agree with the interpretation of the guidelines.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Co-operative Development Agency and Industrial Development Bill</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00691">2.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00692">Read a third time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00693">Clause 2 [<i>Extension of functions and control of Agency</i>]:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00694"><member>Baroness Nicol</member> moved the amendment:
<quote>Page 2, line 44, at end insert&#x2014;</quote>
<quote>("(2) The Agency's Annual Report shall include details of all such directions and of the Agency's replies thereon to the Secretary of State.").</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00695">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move the amendment which stands in my name on the Marshalled List. This amendment is similar to one which we discussed at the Committee stage but which was in fact not moved. At the Report stage the Minister was reassuring about the life of the agency, but the direction of its activities was not discussed. Some of us have doubts about the Government's objectives for the agency in the long term, and it would be reassuring to know that the information asked for in this amendment would be available annually.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00696">The Minster's reply at the Committee stage on 30th July, at col. 565, was as follows:
<quote>"The Secretary of State can be questioned on the use of the power"&#x2014;</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00697">a question which I had particularly asked&#x2014;
<quote>"either in Parliament or through the department".</quote></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0076"/>
<col>135</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00698">However, questions on specific points which may have come to light are no substitute for complete information which will give us the drift of the Secretary of State's control. On several occasions the noble Lord the Minister mentioned that these were reserve powers which might not be much used. If that is so, then our amendment should not add significantly to anyone's workload. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00699"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, very briefly, I rise to support the very reasonable amendment which has been moved by my noble friend Lady Nicol. More than once during the passage of this Bill the Minister has told the House that he has some difficulty in giving illustrations as to why certain powers are being sought, but nevertheless he said that it is better to have them than not to have them.<lb/>
The Minister has sought powers to wind up the agency, but last week he had difficulty in giving us illustrations of the kind of circumstances in which the winding up was likely to be merited. Again, the Minister and his colleagues have gratuitously introduced this power to give directions to the agency and yet have failed to convince me&#x2014;and incidentally his colleagues failed to convince my colleagues in another place&#x2014;that there was a need for it. After all, this is the Government that do not believe in intervention. They believe in electing or appointing people and letting them get on with the job. However, the Minister takes the view that there will be occasions when the Minister concerned will think that the CDA needs to be directed as to the kind of activities and the kind of behaviour that it should adopt.<lb/>
My noble friend has quite simply said that there may very well be a happy resolution of a problem between the Minister and the CDA, where they are satisfied and he is satisfied. The amendment does not seek a cosy relationship; it wants the taxpayers as well as the parliamentary scrutineers to be made aware of what it was that caused the intervention. If the Minister would accept this most reasonable amendment, I think he would be giving aid and comfort to those of us who believe that so far as possible the Government's books should be open. I cannot conceive of any direction which is given by the Minister which would not be proper to be made public. If the Minister is in a reasonable mood I believe that he can do something that he has failed to do during the passage of this Bill&#x2014;that is, accept a reasonable amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00700"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like briefly to oppose this amendment. The amendment falls into two parts. The first part states:
<quote>"The Agency's Annual Report shall include details of all such directions".</quote>
Speaking personally, I can see no objection to that. This is done in many other agencies, Monopolies Commission reports and so forth. But it is the second part to which I object. It reads:
<quote>"and of the Agency's replies thereon to the Secretary of State".</quote>
With the greatest respect to those who have moved this amendment, if under Clause 2(4) the agency has to comply with the directions of the Secretary of State (and this is no longer in question), what on earth, one
<col>136</col>
may ask, is the object of publishing the agency's replies? There is no precedent for this type of situation. Perhaps consideration might be given by Her Majesty's Government as to whether the agency's annual report should include details of directions. As I say, I can see no objection to that. But with the greatest respect I suggest that the second part of the amendment is misconceived.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00701"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Lord Lucas of Chilworth)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for explaining the purpose of her amendment, but I believe that both she and her noble colleague are showing something of an unnecessary concern over what is, after all, a reserve power. I emphasise again that this is a reserve power. I thought I made it quite clear during earlier stages of the Bill that the power of direction has been introduced as a counterpart to the extension of the agency's functions and in particular the removal of the restriction on commercial activities. The Government have thought it proper to take account of the possibility, however remote it may be, that the agency might misuse its new powers at some stage. When I say "might misuse" I do not necessarily mean wittingly; it could, in fact, misuse the powers unwittingly, and I shall explain how I see that in a moment.<lb/>
It is a little invidious to give examples because the Government have confidence in the CDA board, which as I explained in our discussion last week has recently been reappointed with some new members, and they have confidence in the director. Nonetheless, as the noble Lord. Lord Graham, has asked for a specific example, I can only draw on a hypothetical one because I cannot see the need for this reserve power. So I have to use a hypothetical example. Let us suppose that with a different management structure perhaps in a few years' time the CDA developed a particularly lucrative commercial activity, which would be quite within the new functions which are contained in the Bill before us. Let us suppose that it then decided to ignore its other responsibilities in order to concentrate on that activity. It might well be a circumstance in which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State would believe it right to give some direction to turn the attention of the agency back to its main function.<lb/>
That point is not totally academic because complaints about unfair competition have arisen in the past. In explaining his objection to the amendment, in dealing with the first part of it, my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway drew attention to the fact that these powers were contained in a number of other Acts, and he enumerated some of them. In fact, there are a number of others.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Graham, asked: why should I envisage a situation where the CDA needs to be given direction? I think that I have answered that question; I do not see the CDA as needing to be given a direction. The main objection to the amendment is that first we doubt whether it would be necessary to use the power of direction. But if it were used, there is certainly no intention to "gag" the agency in any way if it disagreed with the Secretary of State. We welcome free discussion, particularly in these areas, and during
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0077"/>
<col>137</col>
the passage of this Bill since the summer I have sought to illustrate that to your Lordships. In the event of the Secretary of State giving a direction, I should find it extremely difficult to keep this matter secret because the actions of the agency would demonstrate that something has happened and it would not take very long before the fact that a direction had been given would be elicited.<lb/>
If the Secretary of State made a direction, it may very well not be in the interests of the agency itself that such a direction should be made public in the report. As my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway suggests, having given the direction, there can be no point in the agency's response being printed in an annual report. By that time it would have responded.<lb/>
There may of course be another scenario in which the agency would not want a direction made public, and I say that because I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, shook his head at my earlier remark. For instance, the agency could be involved in negotiations over the acquisition or possibly the disposal of a property. Although it is unlikely, I suggest that it is not inconceivable that a direction might be given regarding such negotiations. If that fell at a time when the annual report were to be published and the amendment before us this afternoon were to be accepted, it would be incumbent upon the agency to report that such a direction had been given in that annual report. Such a report would have to disclose that negotiations were being undertaken. I would think that that could easily be to the detriment of the agency.<lb/>
I have given only two examples because I find it difficult to think up others because it is a reserve power which we quite optimistically do not feel is likely to be used, but for the reasons I have given nevertheless we think it prudent in a matter of this kind that there should be that reserve power. I do not think that I can add anything more to what I have said. Perhaps with that explanation the noble Baroness may feel inclined to withdraw her amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00702">3.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00703"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the House will agree that the Minister has tried hard, but I cannot think that he has convinced many people that he has right on his side. One of the features of this Bill is that there has been a general feeling on all sides of the House that we are after the same objectives. There has been no amendment down that I know about that has not been put down in good faith, and where the spirit of it was not understood by noble Lords opposite. The argument has often been rather narrowly balanced. But with a little more generosity the noble Lord opposite could have accepted some of the amendments, and he really ought to be able to accept this one.<lb/>
The noble Lord went to some lengths to show that they were not intending, and did not expect, to have to use their power of issuing directions very often. I think we accept that. The noble Lord also went to some length to suggest that if the agency went beyond their powers contained in the eventual Act it would probably be unwitting, and I think we accept that. But
<col>138</col>
if there is a difference of opinion as to how the powers of this Bill should be interpreted, a difference between the Government on the one hand and the agency on the other, are we not now trying in this country of ours to get people to understand, to get the general public to understand, what is involved and what the facts are? We have too much misunderstanding. We have too many occasions when there are great arguments in the country, and often based on incomplete information.<lb/>
If there is a difference of opinion between the Government and the agency I, as a member of the public, should like to know what the gradations of opinion are. What are the differences? Why was it that the agency thought that they had powers when the Government decided that they had not powers? Even at this late stage I would hope that the Minister would try at the very last to see whether he could give way on this particular point. He is not giving anything very much away. He is only indicating that they really have faith both in the agency and in the future interpretation of the Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00704"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to prolong the debate but I should like to say for the benefit of those many noble Lords present who were not present at the earlier stages of the Bill that a lot of the amendments arose because the Bill before us is an extension of the life of a body which has been in existence for some years, has been doing a good job which the Government have admitted on many occasions, and indeed they have praised it for the job it has done&#x2014;and suddenly in this Bill extending its life we find a whole range of new powers given to the Minister. They include, although I do not want to dig it up again for too long, the powers to dissolve the agency itself. It seems to us on this side that there must be reasons for the new powers that are being taken. We have failed to find satisfactory reasons for any of them, though the Minister has done his best to reassure us.<lb/>
We therefore can hardly be blamed if we are slightly suspicious of this particular new power. We see it not as a defence of the agency to keep these things secret but as a way of perhaps allowing the Minister to change the direction of the agency, which has been given new commercial powers and which is therefore capable of having its direction changed in ways in which it was never intended to function in the first place. We are therefore worried that these powers may be used to change the direction of the agency. Therefore we simply sought to have the Minister's directions published at the end of the year so that we could satisfy ourselves that these powers were not being misused. Does the Minister wish to intervene?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00705"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I should like to respond to the noble Baroness, and indeed to the noble Lord, Lord Beswick. I can only say again&#x2014;and this must be the fifth or sixth time that I have sought to reassure your Lordships on the intention of the Government with regard to the Co-operative Development Agency&#x2014;that we have provided funding for six years, we have recently appointed a new board, and we have sought to meet the requirements of the agency in opening its functions and its activities.
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0078"/>
<col>139</col>
Noble Lords have spoken about the other amendments. They are behind us. We have debated them. I would only remind your Lordships that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, said last week that he was probing with certainly two of his amendments. He had asked the same question: "What are your intentions?" He had asked it many times, and I had given him the self-same answer to the self-same question. He thanked me for that and said, "Well, at least that message is getting home to some people".<lb/>
There is no subterfuge on the Government's part with regard to the refusal of amendments. I have sought to explain logically our refusal to accept this amendment. I said earlier that perhaps I had nothing else to say. However, the noble Lord, Lord Beswick, sparked off something else. We do not in this Bill forbid the inclusion in the annual report of the CDA anything that the CDA wish to include. They can do what they like. If we accept the amendment that the noble Baroness and others seek to impose on the Bill, what we do is place an obligation upon the agency&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00706"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has said something very important, and I just want to make it clear. Is he saying that the agency would be free in their annual report to give details of the direction and of their reply to it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00707"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know of nothing in the Bill that gives any kind of direction to the agency as to what they shall include in their report. If we accept" the amendment, then we impose upon them an obligation to do certain things. It is an obligation which they may not wish under certain circumstances. I have sought to describe one of them, the property deal. I think that the noble Baroness and her noble friends are being unduly sensitive about this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00708"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not wish to prolong the debate. The Minister has done his best in a rather difficult situation. I am reassured to hear that the agency is free to publish what it will in its annual report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00711">Moved, That the Bill do now pass.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lucas of Chilworth.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00712"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the Bill passes, may I say that I have had a lifelong association with the co-operative movement and the co-operative idea, and I wonder whether I may say a word of welcome and congratulation to the Government on the passing of this Bill. The Government are frequently charged with obsessive belief in the virtues of private enterprise. In passing this Bill and guaranteeing the continued existence of the Co-operative Development Agency they have recognised the relevance of the co-operative idea in the mixed economy of the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I felt only one little twinge of embarrassment about it, because I am not too keen on organisations going to
<col>140</col>
the Government for assistance. I read the balance sheet of the CWS and the CIS today, and noted their massive investments in private enterprise&#x2014;quite rightly. Ordinary shares in the CIS are &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;2 billion. The CWS is the largest wholesale trader in this country&#x2014;successfully, I am glad to say. I can only express, through the Minister, to my friends who represent co-operative interests in this House, that perhaps this encouragement from the Government will stimulate the existing co-operative movement to play its full part in developing co-operative activities within the Co-operative Development Agency.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00713">3.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00714"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, has dealt with the Co-operative Development Agency part of this Bill, but as some of your Lordships may have noticed the Bill also comprises, in Part II, an industrial development Bill. In the course of the Second Reading debate and in Committee I passed some observations as to the incongruity of this position of the Co-operative Development Agency (which deals, if I may say so with respect to my friends in the co-operative movement, with a comparatively small segment of the United Kingdom) forming Part I, whereas the industrial development Bill, which by its implications is of very considerable interest to the entire United Kingdom, comprises Part II. It is of interest particularly to those millions of unemployed who are currently within the development areas, whether they be assisted areas, development areas or special development areas, or whether they are in the West Midlands area, which now qualifies to be a development area but is not, so far, in it, and where there is considerable unemployment at this time.<lb/>
I have protested before, and I renew my protest, that Part II of the Bill ought to have been a Bill on its own, discussed on its own merits within the wider context to which it relates. But this has not been done. It is almost as though the Budget resolutions in another place had been appended as Part II to a gaming Bill, which is a very incongruous position. It is my view and the view of my noble friends that this course of action, taken in haste, was so that the new powers granted to the Minister would pass virtually unnoticed without any regard to the nationwide repercussions that the decisions that he makes, and is empowered to make under the Bill, would have.<lb/>
I do not want to repeat much, if indeed any, if I can help it, of what I have said at previous stages of this Bill. But it is necessary to remind your Lordships&#x2014;at least, it may be necessary&#x2014;that of the 25 identified poor areas in Europe no fewer than 10 are in the United Kingdom. Of the 12 worst poverty areas in Europe, no fewer than five are in the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I have been hopeful, ever since this Bill started in this House, that the Government would be prepared to give a far greater indication of what they propose to do. The only powers that have been taken in this Bill have been to redefine the criteria on which aid is supposed to be granted. What they have not done, and what they could have done, is to tell the House how they propose to use these powers. They could have told the House, as indeed has been the practice before.
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0079"/>
<col>141</col>
what were the new classifications for assisted development and special development areas, and how, if at all, the new areas varied from those in the 1982 Act, which in its turn amended the 1972 Act. But they have done none of these things, and one wonders why. It is true enough that information has been leaking out, not from the Department of Industry but from the Department of Employment. There has been a gradual influx of information, available in the Library, of course, which gives some clues as to what would happen if, for example, the new aid were directed in regard to areas based on travel-to-work areas. But as the noble Lord knows quite well, in the Bill those are not the only criteria. Clause 4 mentions wards in addition, parliamentary constituencies and so on.<lb/>
The Department of Employment <i>Gazette</i> for September this year now gives information on what would happen if these other classifications were brought into effect. For this we are very grateful. Why is it, then, that the Government have not been able to introduce this Bill after a proper explanation of what they propose to do? Is it possibly due to unresolved differences in the Cabinet itself because there are different philosophies, each one of which has some bearing on the decisions that have to be made?<lb/>
Mr. Norman Tebbit, for example, speaking quite recently&#x2014;I am referring to a report in <i>The Times</i> of 12th October&#x2014;said this:
<quote>"The market system, allied with free enterprise, gives a better allocation of capital and human resources than any other yet devised".</quote>
In view of the existence of 20 million unemployed in Europe as a whole and some four million here, one can beg to doubt that bold assertion, which indeed was doubted by his colleague, Mr. Walker, who ventured to qualify the whole matter by saying:
<quote>"The market economy idolises people as consumers and as long as the market mechanism is working it does give consumers a wide freedom of choice. But people are more than just consumers. They are workers, managers, householders and students.</quote>
<quote>Consumer freedom for them is one aspect of a free society, an important aspect &#x2026; Progressive Tories cannot rest easy if Government restricts their activities to just oiling the wheels of the market economy".</quote>
Is there, therefore, a battle in the Cabinet which has produced the indecision which has in turn produced no further information as to how the Government propose to apply regional aid?<lb/>
Regional aid is of great significance in seeking to correct those manifest instances of where the free market economy does not work. If the free market economy worked to the benefit of all in the United Kingdom and all the differences between regions were self-adjusting by the working of the market, that would be one thing; but they are not. The magnitude of the Government's expenditure on the regions&#x2014;expenditure necessary to bring new life and new hope into areas of Wales, the North of England and other areas&#x2014;is based fundamentally on an admission that there, precisely because the free market mechanism has not worked, the state must take corrective and ameliorative action and must by some means inject sums into those localities in order not merely that life can be preserved there&#x2014;and they are now covering a much larger area than they were in 1979&#x2014;but also
<col>142</col>
that those living there, and in particular the young people, are able to formulate purposes in life; are able, yes, my Lords, to have dreams of a future. And there is nothing wrong in having dreams.<lb/>
Therefore, the Government's expenditure under this head and the extent of that expenditure are one measure by which the country as a whole can judge this Government's determination to encourage growth where growth is most sorely needed; to prevent dereliction where there is growing decay; to engender hope and purpose where there is now despair, disillusionment and cynicism. This is, or should be, the whole purpose of the regional development and the funds that are made available to it by the Treasury.<lb/>
We have heard frequent homilies about Government expenditure, and we are told from time to time that the funds made available, coming as they do out of taxpayers' money, must be scrutinised with great care and kept to the absolute minimum. It is quite clear, from the context within which the debates in Committee, on Second Reading and on Report have taken place, that it is the intention of the Government drastically to cut down the money that they have hitherto spent in the regions themselves. A figure of as much as &#x00A3;200 million has been mentioned, although I fully understand that the noble Lord opposite cannot possibly confirm or deny that figure. However, I would remind the House when it comes to social priorities that the Government are quite willing to spend &#x00A3;200 million of taxpayers' money, if we believe the accuracy of the <i>Financial Times</i> article on the subject, on the promotion of the sales of shares in British Telecom&#x2014;money paid out in commission to bankers, commission to accountants, underwriting fees, publicity, printing and all the rest of it. That apparently is good and desirable expenditure of taxpayers' money in order that British Telecom may be piratised by their <i>rentier</i> friends.<lb/>
Are the Government going to take regional development seriously at all? The indications are that they are not. I do not want unduly to trespass on the content of the next debate on the Order Paper, which deals particularly and in very great detail with regional development affairs. It is very convenient, presumably, to have them on the same day&#x2014;and I must commend the Government Chief Whip on this&#x2014;because if I stray into the discussion on the report now I shall be told that I shall have a later opportunity of dealing with the matter, and if in the European Regional Development Fund debate that is going to take place next I omit something that relates to the United Kingdom, I shall then be told that I really ought to have raised it in the previous debate on the passing of the industrial development Bill. So the Government are in a very good position here.<lb/>
The Government's attitude to regional development as a whole in the United Kingdom, particularly when one relates it to the other priorities upon which they are prepared to squander vast sums of taxpayers' money, is a public scandal and should be regarded as such. However, the asperities that I have seen fit to make do not prevent me from saying that we on this side of the House very much appreciate the manner in which the noble Lord. Lord Lucas of Chilworth, has dealt with this Bill. No matter how unpleasant and how inconsequential much of it has been to those of us
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0080"/>
<col>143</col>
on this side of the House, and despite the acerbities that have been hurled at him from time to time, and despite a certain degree of robustness with which the arguments have been addressed to him, he has maintained his unfailing courtesy and has certainly dealt as well as he possibly could with the various matters raised in the Bill. For this we thank him; but it does not prevent us from regarding the Bill itself as the most miserable bit of trivia that has ever been inflicted upon the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00715">3.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00716"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I take a little of the time of the House by first expressing our appreciation, echoing the words of my noble friend Lord Bruce, of the unfailing courtesy of the Minister in piloting this Bill through the House. At all times he has tried to be helpful. Very often he was unable to be helpful, but at all times he tried. The fact that there have been proscriptions upon spelling out what we wanted him to spell out did not stop us from time to time trying to get him to do just that. I speak from these Benches not with the authority but with experience of the co-operative moment, primarily the consumer co-operative movement. I can certainly tell the Minister that the view that is held in the consumer co-operative movement is that we value the extension of the life of the CDA, recognising, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, has said, that there are many ways in which the co-operative idea can be applied.<lb/>
What we have seen&#x2014;and to some extent this is thanks to the work of the CDA in the previous six years&#x2014;has been a flowering of the co-operative idea in many ways which augurs well for the future. At one time the consumer co-operative movement was paramount. Now it has to recognise (and it welcomes) the presence of an extending worker/producer co-operative movement, a housing co-operative movement, a credit co-operative movement and the agricultural co-operative movement, which is not a recent phenomenon and has been well established over time.<lb/>
The Minister is well aware of the two prime reservations that have been mentioned from this side as far as the CDA is concerned. One is the issue of the power to direct, and the other the power to wind up. The Minister has sought to assure us that these are almost benign. We fear that they may very well turn out to be malignant. The Minister has gone some way to assure us that as far as he is concerned he sees a full six years' life ahead for the CDA. As he has pointed out, the funds are there in order to ensure it. The co-operative movement will watch the next six years&#x2014;and we wanted to have six years&#x2014;with a great deal of pride in what we have been able to do so far in establishing the CDA. We recognise that the Minister has said as much as he possibly can to make sure that the CDA has firm directions in the changing of the functions, and also has the cash.<lb/>
Reference was made by the noble Lord. Lord Taylor of Gryfe, to the value that the existing co-operative movement can be to the new co-operative movement. Certainly I can say with some authority that we have been very pleased to make available the expertise and the knowledge which repose inside the co-operative
<col>144</col>
movement, to make sure that our sucessors are given a fair wind. I am very grateful indeed to the Minister for wanting to dispel any gloom which the co-operative movement may have felt. We do not intend to be gloomy. We are optimistic for the future and we certainly wish the CDA well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00717"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I feel that I should respond very briefly. I am obliged to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, for his comments, particularly on Part I of the Bill. The Government firmly believe that the co-operative form of enterprise has a potential and will contribute quite significantly to the creation of new businesses and jobs. We recognise the important role of the CDA, and I can say no more about that.<lb/>
I must confess I was somewhat amused by the noble Lord's remarks with regard to the co-operative movement as a whole; and when the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, said that the movement was pleased to support the agency's activities with their expertise and so on, I was rather hoping that perhaps he was going to add in parenthesis, "We might even put some cash alongside that".<lb/>
I would not say that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, does not speak with authority. It was the authoritative way in which he conducted his arguments during the course of the Bill that I personally found most helpful. The whole House recognises that he is an authority on the Bill. When he says he hopes that the CDA will go for its full term of six years, I say to him, "Six plus what?&#x2014;six plus six plus six?" The aim of the Government, in loosening the bonds of the agency, is that it should become more self-supporting and then go on perhaps to bigger and better things. He and I share that belief, I know.<lb/>
Lastly, I should like to turn to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington. First, let me thank him for the latter remarks in his contribution this afternoon. They followed much the same pattern as his remarks that were made that Friday afternoon in the summer. Today he is pleased that we have got two similar debates on the same day, but we had two that Friday in the summer, of course, but he did not like that and I wondered why.<lb/>
Let me just answer two main points. He said, "This is a wretched little Bill" and he thought there should have been two Bills. He knows as well as I and the rest of your Lordships the pressures of legislation. He knows also&#x2014;because we have discussed it&#x2014;that both Houses of Parliament will have the opportunity of debating the detailed changes this Bill allows for&#x2014;details which he keeps pressing me to give him but which I have told him I am unable to give at this time. I did say last week that most of this would be out by the end of this year. Then we shall have those orders put before Parliament, and both Houses will be able to debate them; so there is nothing hidden at all.<lb/>
The other point he made some fairly heavy weather of, I thought, was when he talked about Cabinet decisions, our monetary policies and the like. I would just finish by saying that of course we recognise the social need for regional grant and regional help. I explained earlier that the Bill was to change the way this was done. We did not believe that the old way was
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0081"/>
<col>145</col>
either cost-effective or well targeted, and this Bill provides for changes in the method. For the first time, the White Paper upon which this Bill is based recognises the social significance of regional policy; and that is why the Bill, as we have explained on a number of occasions during its passage, targets that support on jobs. That, I believe, is a social priority and it is one which this Bill will support in its entirety. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ILEA: Elections</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00719"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (The Earl of Avon)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement about the timing of the first direct elections to the new Inner London Education Authority, which is now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"The Government announced earlier this year that in the light of the consultations which they had carried out they had decided that the new Inner London Education Authority to be formed on the abolition of the Greater London Council should be directly elected. During the passage through Parliament of the Local Government (Interim Provisions) Act 1984, it was also decided that the term of office of the existing GLC members (from whom the bulk of the ILEA membership is drawn) should be extended from May 1985, when elections would have been due, to April 1986, the proposed date of abolition. We have been considering how best to secure continuity for the administration of education in inner London through the transition.<lb/>
"The Government have concluded that the first direct elections to the authority which will succeed the ILEA should be held in May 1986 to coincide with the London borough elections. We propose that the new corporate body which is to take over the functions of the ILEA from 1st April 1986 should be established, like the new joint boards, in September 1985, in order to prepare the budget and fix the precept for 1986&#x2013;87 and make other necessary preparations.<lb/>
"From its establishment until the elections in May 1986, the new body would be composed of the present members of the ILEA (who will, of course, also continue to constitute the existing authority as a special committee of the GLC until 1st April 1986). Later elections would also coincide with those for the borough councils.<lb/>
"Unlike other services for which the GLC has a responsibility, the functions exercised by the ILEA will be exercised by a single directly elected body. The new authority will differ from the existing ILEA only in the method by which it is constituted. In these circumstances it is appropriate to place the responsibility for the preparatory work which the new authority will need to undertake on the existing members of the ILEA.
<col>146</col>
"This provides the best guarantee for continuity of administration and a smooth transition to the new arrangements and is consistent with the Government's decision to enable GLC members, including those who are members of the ILEA, to continue to perform their functions until 1st April 1986."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes my right honourable friend's Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00720"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the Minister for repeating this Statement. We are glad that the elections will be held at the same time as the borough elections in May 1986 and that later elections will also coincide with those for the borough councils. This obviously means a better turn-out at the polls.<lb/>
I have a few questions about the establishing of the new body in September 1985. How will this be done? Under what authority? What powers will it have? Also, is it a case of pre-empting legislation, the GLC abolition Bill, which we have not yet seen?<lb/>
On the second page of the Statement it says:
<quote>"The new authority will differ from the existing ILEA only in the method by which it is constituted".</quote>
How is it to be constituted? What will the representation be? Will there be nominees from the boroughs and from the City of London, as there are now, and will there be co-opted members?<lb/>
We appreciate the Government's desire that there should be continuity of administration and a smooth transition to the new arrangements: that is a sensible recognition of the need for continuity in the best interests of the education service. I should like to ask, in preparing the budget and fixing the precept for 1986&#x2013;87, under what constraints will the members be? In 1985&#x2013;86, the Government say there has to be a &#x00A3;75 million cut in expenditure. Is the new authority to have greater freedom when it is fixing the precept?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00721"><member>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we too should like to welcome the Statement and indeed join the noble Baroness in welcoming the timing of the elections. That seems to be an extremely sensible suggestion and the procedures so far outlined in this Statement appear to be of the right kind. We on these Benches have always been in favour of a directly elected ILEA, unlike some other noble Lords on this side of the House who are late converts to the idea, and we certainly hope that this will be a successful experiment. The question which the noble Baroness, Lady David, raised about the financial constraints under which the new authority will operate is a very pertinent one. Will it in fact have freedom to operate as it should within the limits which are necessary in London, and can we have some assurance&#x2014;this is presumably the case&#x2014;that the costs of the elections for the ILEA&#x2014;and there are bound to be some costs, even though they are taking place at the same time as the borough elections&#x2014;will in no way come out of the education budget?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00722"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful both to the noble Baroness and to the noble Lord for their reception of this Statement and of the idea of these elections in May 1986. As the noble Baroness rightly
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0082"/>
<col>147</col>
thought, the authority for the elections will be in the Bill on the abolition which will be put before the House in the new Session. That is one of the reasons why nothing can happen before September 1985, because one would not expect Royal Assent to the new Bill until July next year.<lb/>
We are looking to exactly the same representation on the interim committee as there is now, and we very much hope that the same people will continue in office. In the same spirit, the same conditions will affect the budget for the year after this one as have affected this one, and the same terms will apply. The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, asked me about the costs of the elections. I do not have a brief on that. It is an interesting point and I shall find out for him what our thinking is on that subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00723"><member>Lord Alport</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask my noble friend whether he realises how difficult it is sometimes for laymen like myself to understand the full implications of a ministerial Statement? But would I be right in supposing that what this means is that the present ILEA will continue until May 1986 in two guises&#x2014;first, as an established committee of the GLC until the GLC ceases to exist, and then subsequently as the new corporate body which will administer education in London until the elections take place? If that is the case, then may I ask my noble friend whether he realises that the discussions which we had in this House earlier in this Session with regard to this particular problem were concerned primarily with the essential continuity of the administration of education in London, and in so far as this plan produces that continuity and enables the future elected body to take over from the existing one in one day, so to speak, it will be greatly welcomed by those who are governors of London schools, the staff of the Inner London Education Authority and all those who have the interests of education in London at heart?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00724"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for my noble friend's welcome and I can say that the whole purport of this is the essential continuity which he describes. What will happen is that the present ILEA will take on a new hat in September 1985 and the same people will be wearing two hats until the abolition of the GLC in 1986.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00725"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has told us that the authority for the new ILEA will come in the abolition Bill. Can he tell us what other details will come in the abolition Bill? Shall we know about the numbers for each borough and the method of election? Does not this timing give the Secretary of State time to issue a consultation document on these important matters; that is, the numbers of representatives from each borough, whether there will be any co-opted members and the method of election?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00726"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that we shall have plenty of time to discuss this during the spring of next year and to listen to any noble Lord's suggestions on this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00727"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the high-spending record of the current ILEA, and my
<col>148</col>
noble friend's reference in his reply to my noble friend Lord Alport as to continuity, may I ask whether he can give some indication as to what constraints will be placed on the new ILEA as to the size of the precepts which it might levy on the London boroughs?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00728"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in answer to my noble friend, of course the precepts will be as they are now&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00729"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: Oh dear!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00730"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: At the moment, we are looking at the expenditure limits of the present budget and we shall continue to look at it in the same way as we are now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00731"><member>Lord Beloff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as one who took some part in the campaign for an elected ILEA, may I indicate that not everyone will be wholly pleased about the fact that the elections are to be on the same date as the borough elections? One of the chief arguments that we put forward was to try to separate in the minds of London's electorate the educational issues of the capital from the other issues concerning local government which come up in ordinary borough elections. It is clearly no use asking the Government to change their mind on this aspect, but might I ask the noble Earl the Minister whether he would put to his honourable friend the idea that in the elections there should certainly be a distinction and that on no account should the ballot paper be a single one for both authorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00732"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, of course I appreciate what my noble friend has said and equally what other Members of the House have said: that this will be an opportunity for people to elect two bodies on the same day. I asked the same question as my noble friend when I was given the briefing on this subject, and of course this is a point which we can raise when we debate the abolition Bill in the new year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00733"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I follow up the question of the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock? Is it proposed that there will be a separate Bill in the form of a representation of the people Bill, which will outline the whole question of the conduct of the elections; will these matters be dealt with in the abolition Bill or merely by a clause there referring to sections on the conduct of elections, or have the Government not considered this aspect?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00734"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the idea is that this will be part of the abolition Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00735"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl agree that the previous speaker's suggestion, that the administration of education can be divorced from local government, is nonsense, bearing in mind that all of the local authorities outside the Greater London area have the responsibility of looking after the education of the people in those areas? Is the Minister aware that that is an accepted fact? Those of us with a history in local government were always taught that there were three political forces in local government&#x2014;Conservative. Labour and the education lobby. I think
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0083"/>
<col>149</col>
that on this occasion the Government have got it right in keeping them separate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00736"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Lord's support and I am sorry that the right reverend Prelate has not spoken also.</membercontribution></p>

<title>European Regional Development Fund: ECC Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00737">3.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00738"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the report of the European Communities Committee on the European Regional Development Fund (23rd Report, 1983&#x2013;84, H.L.274).</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00739">The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is the fund which nowadays is commonly known as the ERDF&#x2014;a piece of shorthand which I shall use frequently in my forthcoming remarks. This is the fourth report by the committee on this subject since 1977. The ERDF was set up in 1975 to correct the structural and regional imbalances within the Community which might impede the realisation of economic and monetary union. Its purpose was to aid the improvement of economic performance in the poorer regions of the Community, with particular emphasis on job creation in order to bring about a higher degree of convergence among member states.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00740">The economic circumstances of the Community have changed radically since 1975, and economic and monetary union has receded into the distant future, even for those who sincerely desire it. It is still accepted, however, that excessive regional disparities are harmful to the Community and that without the ERDF they would be greater than they are.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00741">The Regional Fund therefore has widespread if not universal support. The committee are aware that there are those who question the whole concept of regional aid, feeling that it does more harm than good and that the vast sums spent on it could be put to better use in other ways. Such arguments are not without force, but neither in this nor in their earlier reports on the subject have the committee felt it their duty to enter into a general discussion of the validity of regional aid.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00742">Regional aid programmes exist, and doubtless will continue to exist, on a massive scale in all Community countries. The committee were concerned with how far the ERDF supports or enlarges such programmes and how far it promotes Community rather than national objectives. In the 10 years of its existence, the ERDF has grown to be the second largest regular charge on the Community budget after&#x2014;admittedly a long way after&#x2014;the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00743">At present, the ERDF awards grants each year to a total value of over &#x00A3;1 billion to projects from all over the Community. Even so, it remains a relatively small charge on the budget, absorbing in recent years between 5 and 8 per cent. of the available resources. And, of course, ERDF disbursements are very small compared with member states' own regional spending, which ranges from at least 10 times to 50 times the
<col>150</col>
European contribution. Ninety-five per cent. of this contribution has hitherto been allotted under a system giving fixed quotas to individual countries weighted in favour of the poorest countries, which are Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Our quota at present is 23&#x00B7;8 per cent. of the 95 per cent. The remaining 5 per cent. of the ERDF is distributed on a non-quota basis, reflecting Community rather than national priorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00744">In the mid-1980s the ERDF is making grants each year some seven times the cash value of those made in the first three years of its existence. After making allowance for inflation, this still represents a substantial real increase in Community spending on regional aid, and this larger expenditure has been concentrated increasingly on the poorest and poorer regions of the Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00745">Despite this, disparities in prosperity between the different regions of the Community appear to have widened since the early 1970s. Poorer regions have, not unnaturally, failed to grow as quickly as the richer, and some formerly prosperous regions have fallen on hard times. Happily, these divergences are no longer increasing, but to go further and reverse the trend will not be easy. If present plans, as enunciated at Fontainebleau, for more effective controls over Community budget expenditure are successful&#x2014;and there is no certainty yet that they will be&#x2014;more funds for regional aid should become available. But any such increase is not likely to be anything like big enough to have a massive impact on regional imbalances, even supposing that national governments were prepared to allow Community regional aid to supplement their own regional aid programmes.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00746">This brings me to the vexed question of additionality, which your committee have discussed and probed over many years. Clearly, Community contributions to regional aid would be much more worthwhile if they truly supplemented a national regional aid programme rather than being used just to finance a part of that programme. In some marginal instances this does appear to happen but, in the main, governments simply pocket the Community contributions as a set-off" against their own regional expenditure. Nevertheless, in the United Kingdom, for example, an elaborate process goes on year after year under which numerous proposals for ERDF aid are prepared by local and regional authorities and, if accepted by the Department of Trade and Industry, are submitted to Brussels for consideration. In this laborious way we manage eventually to lay our hands on our quota entitlement, to the minimal advantage, as your committee saw it, of the regional authorities who make successful applications.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00747">Between 1975, when the ERDF was created, up to the end of 1982 almost &#x00A3;1 billion of ERDF aid&#x2014;and the fact that that figure is similar to the one I quoted earlier is quite coincidental&#x2014;has been paid or promised to the United Kingdom in respect of some 4,232 regional projects. Most of these were to create new infrastructure in eligible regions. While there never seems to be a shortage of such projects, it is a little depressing to note that not only in the United Kingdom but in all member countries since 1980 there has been increasing difficulty in generating investment projects suitable for ERDF aid from manufacturing
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0084"/>
<col>151</col>
industry or from the craft or service sectors. This is partly responsible for the inordinate delay in all Community countries in taking up quota entitlements.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00748">The evidence supplied to your committee did not suggest that the general administration of the ERDF was entirely satisfactory. There seemed to be some lack of co-ordination between the various directorates-general in the Commission concerned with these matters while, at the Council of Ministers, regional policy is apparently decided by foreign ministers rather than those directly responsible for regional questions. This led the committee to conclude that there should be a Council of Ministers with specific responsibility for regional policy closely co-ordinating their work with the relevant national authorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00749">Likewise, evidence concerning United Kingdom procedures did not show a reassuring picture. The December White Paper on regional industrial development raised doubts about the whole future of United Kingdom regional policy&#x2014;if, indeed, there is a coherent policy covering the whole country. Some regional authorities are very effective in this area. In other places they hardly exist. The Whitehall departments clearly keep a firm grip on all questions of regional aid but they could do with more forceful advice, not only from some but from all relevant areas. The regional development agencies should cover all areas and be more effectively used. This would perhaps be most likely to happen if one leading minister with one department behind him were to be responsible for regional policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00750">The Council of Ministers have been discussing a reform of the ERDF for some two and a half years and, after sitting on proposals from the Commission for most of that time, in an unexpected burst of activity and decisiveness last May-June approved revised proposals by the Commission which broadened the scope of the ERDF and seek to increase Community influence in the field of regional aid. Almost all the evidence received by the committee was favourable to the new proposals. I shall try briefly to summarise them.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00751">The division of the fund into quota and non-quota sections will go. Each country will in future have a flexible quota range. To achieve the maximum allocation within its range, each country will have to offer programmes for ERDF aid in competition with the other member states. Acceptance will depend on whether proposals meet Community rather than simply national policy objectives.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00752">The regulations of the ERDF will also give formal eligibility to integrated operations&#x2014;that is, those which bring together a number of the Commission's agencies acting in concert: for example, the Social Fund, the Regional Fund and the European Investment Bank. Similar status will be given to the assistance of internally-generated development schemes in poorer regions. Most importantly, there will be a phased replacement of individual proposals for project finance by finance for broader, co-ordinated programmes which it is hoped will have more impact on regional development.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00753">Your committee welcome all these changes but they are at this stage no more than an expression of good
<col>152</col>
intentions. It remains to be seen whether the use of the ERDF can be effectively directed towards Community ends; in particular, whether real and substantial additionality can be achieved. Certainly it cannot be without acceptance by member states. Administrative arrangements both in the Commission and by member states need to be overhauled to eliminate the long delays which now occur in ERDF disbursements. Finally, more attention must be given to the need to create employment&#x2014;especially long-term employment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00754">To conclude, I repeat that there seems to be little prospect that the European Regional Development Fund will be so substantially increased in the foreseeable future as to enable it to make a decisive contribution to the solution of the problems of regional imbalance. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00755">Moved, That this House takes note of the report of the European Communities Committee on the European Regional Development Fund (23 rd Report, 1983&#x2013;84, H.L. 274).&#x2014;(<i>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury.</i>)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00756">4.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00757"><member>Baroness Carnegy of Lour</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we are all grateful to the noble Lord for his clear and concise introduction to what seems to me to be an admirably clear report. In so far as the report goes, and within the limits which the sub-committee set itself, I agree with the contents, and I agree, with certain reservations which the report makes clear, that the new ERDF regulation is an acceptable updating and improvement of previous arrangements.<lb/>
As the noble Lord has said, the committee did not see it as its duty&#x2014;rightly so, in my view&#x2014;to embark upon discussion of the validity of the whole concept of regional aid as part of the Community's activities. But, as the noble Lord also said, it does acknowledge that there are those who have their doubts. I venture to suggest that Parliament and the Government should also have doubts; that your Lordships should not regard endorsement of this regulation in the short term as a satisfactory end to the story in the longer term.<lb/>
The justification for the operation of the regional fund must surely be judged in the context of the objectives of the Community as a whole. As the report says, the objective of economic and monetary union is no longer immediately in front of us. The objective now is seen as mainly political; a growing understanding and sense of unity in Europe&#x2014;a working and acting together to mutual advantage. But what does the regional fund look like to the ordinary person?<lb/>
If I may take the Scottish experience, which is familiar to me, as an example&#x2014;and it is not a bad example because, as the report points out, Scotland's arrangements make it one of the parts of the United Kingdom best placed to take advantage of the fund&#x2014;the first action a person sees being taken by the regional fund in his locality is a notice in the press announcing that the local authority has applied for a certain sum from the fund. The second thing he sees is that the application has or has not been granted. And that is that. The project proceeds with little more mention at all of the EEC&#x2014;but plenty of mention, of course, of the project.
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0085"/>
<col>153</col>
It looks good at the time, although most people perceive this aid as simply part of what has been paid into the fund coming back again&#x2014;and they are not entirely wrong in thinking that. If they knew the actual cost of the bureaucracy involved in that circulation of funds, they might be even less enthusiastic. There is the cost to local government of putting together the application, the cost to the taxpayer of the co-ordination in the industry department within the Scottish Office, the cost of more co-ordination in the United Kingdom's Department of Industry and in the Community, the cost of the decision by the Community, and then of the disbursement of the funds. No figure can ever be stated, but it must be very large.<lb/>
Nor would people be encouraged if they knew what their elected members suspect; that the amount which comes to them by this roundabout route for a road, reservoir, sewerage scheme or coastal protection scheme may simply be docked off the United Kingdom's regional aid which they might otherwise get for something else. So quite apart from doubts about the effectiveness of regional aid as a concept, is it the right way nowadays for the EEC to be operating? Is it the best way of demonstrating to people the importance of belonging to the Community? I would suggest that it is not.<lb/>
This is not the occasion to go into what the alternative might be, but there may be lessons to be learnt from the success of one of the modes of operation of the Social Fund, where pilot schemes are set up in individual member states. Their success or lack of it is closely monitored and reported upon, and that experience is shared and built up within the Community. That system seems to work well.<lb/>
Perhaps innovative pilot schemes could be set up in each member state under the regional fund to try out ideas for creating long-term jobs and self-employment opportunities, with plenty of publicity and interchange of results, and with the countries then building on one another's talents and experience. Perhaps pilot schemes of that kind would help people identify with the Community more than they do at present as a result of the regional fund. That is just one possibility as to how, at much less cost and with much less bureaucratic effort than that involved in the present schemes, the benefits of Community co-operation and shared talent and experience could help and be seen to help the areas which need that help most.<lb/>
In any case, it is, alas, clear from this summer's European elections that the present operation of the Community is as yet worryingly unconvincing to the electorate of Europe as a whole. Despite a campaign and election organisation costing &#x00A3;25&#x00B7;6 million, and with 42 million of the electorate under civic or legal obligation to vote, only 57 per cent. of them voted&#x2014;5 per cent. less than last time. The lowest turnout of all was in this country.<lb/>
I submit that, if it is true that the regional fund should be a major shop window for the European Community, then the present concept of direct regional aid is probably not the best one and that better ideas in the long term should be sought. Until then, I warmly accept this excellent report.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00759"><member>Lord Banks</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the whole House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien of Lothbury, and to his committee for the production of this most valuable report. We are also grateful to the noble Lord for the way in which he introduced the report to the House this afternoon.<lb/>
When we last discussed this subject in June 1982 we were considering the 1981 proposals of the Commission for a revised regulation. After two years of negotiation those proposals were revised by the Commission in November 1983, and a new regulation, partly based upon that revision, was agreed by the Council of Ministers in June 1984. In that debate in 1982 I said that in all three of the reports that the committee had up to that time made&#x2014;in 1977, 1981 and 1982&#x2014;it had been concerned with five main problems: the size of the fund; the vexed question, as the noble Lord called it, of additionality; the method of allocation; the problem of access to the Community; and the participation in decisions by regional and local authorities and the need for a comprehensive and significant overall regional policy.<lb/>
It is clear from this latest report, which we are now considering, that these five issues remain dominant. First of all, there is the size of the fund. It is true, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, said, that in real terms the fund has increased in size and that it is now the second largest regular charge on the Community budget, after agriculture. But as he pointed out, agricultural expenditure is many times greater&#x2014;in fact, about 10 times greater&#x2014;than expenditure under the fund. The fund disburses &#x00A3;1 billion to projects all over the Community. That sounds a large amount of money until one reflects that the United Kingdom Government alone spends over &#x00A3;15 billion a year on defence and over &#x00A3;30 billion a year on social security. The &#x00A3;1 billion is then seen in perspective, and it represents about 0&#x00B7;08 per cent. of the Community's gross domestic product. Other Community policies, of course, particularly the agricultural policy, have a different regional impact upon the fund.<lb/>
The purpose of the fund is stated again in the report and was stated by the noble Lord this afternoon. It is to correct the structural and regional imbalances which might affect realisation of economic and monetary union. While, as the report says, disparaties would have been worse without the fund, we have to acknowledge its very limited nature and face the fact that such a comparatively small fund could not possibly correct the structural and regional imbalances within the Community&#x2014;disparities which have grown considerably since the 1970s, even if there is now evidence that they have ceased to grow further. Clearly we must maintain the pressure for a considerably increased allocation of funds for the regional fund.<lb/>
Additionality is the next point. It is now widely agreed that, while governments may say that they take into account what they expect to get from the European Regional Development Fund in making their plans for development, there can be no proof that they do so. It is not easy to say whether any extra activity takes place as a result of the fund or whether the fund merely relieves the burden on taxpayers and ratepayers of what would happen in any event. This
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0086"/>
<col>155</col>
greatly restricts the incentive to local authorities to take an interest in applying for help from the fund and provides no incentive for private business firms. The committee says that a greater element of additionality is needed if confidence in the usefulness of the fund is to be maintained. I am sure it is right to say that. It also says that additionality will only occur when individual member states decide that that is what they want. It implies that in Britian the reverse is the case because, it states,
<quote>"It seems that the United Kingdom is expecting the European Regional Development Fund to pay in future for a higher share (in money terms) of a much reduced national regional aid scheme".</quote>
I should like to ask the noble Lord the Minister who is to reply to the debate this question: is that the policy of the Government? Does that quotation from the committee's report fairly represent the present policy of the Government?<lb/>
Then there is the method of allocation. It was encouraging to read on 8th October, in newspaper reports of the Commission's annual report on the regional fund, that 10 EC countries, including the United Kingdom, received more than 95 per cent. of the grants last year. Allocations are being increasingly concentrated in the poorest regions of the Community and that is very good news. I should like to ask whether the Government are confident that the sort of distribution which the figures reveal for 1983 will be maintained under the new regulation? Is that the Government's view and expectation?<lb/>
However, nine-tenths of the money distributed in 1983 went to infrastructure projects. The committee's report points out that there is a serious imbalance between infrastructure and industrial projects, which these recent figures confirm. Administrative problems, delays and the lack of additionality are no doubt among the reasons for this. Can the noble Lord say, when replying, what the Government feel about this and how they think the problem should be tackled?<lb/>
Fourthly, there is the question of access to the Community. In all the debates which we have had so far I have expressed concern, as have other noble Lords, about the participation of local authorities and regional agencies in the preparation of projects and programmes. The report has much to say about that. It says that in the United Kingdom local authorities are kept firmly in a subordinate role. The report speaks about insufficient liaison between central Government and local government. It also states:
<quote>"More effective regional machinery. especially in England, would enable the more disadvantaged regions to respond more rapidly to the European Regional Development Fund's call for programmes."</quote>
Again, it states:
<quote>"There are major gaps in the machinery of regional administration in the United Kingdom which must be rectified if the programme approach is to have a wide and successful application."</quote>
Finally. the report states:
<quote>"Greater use should be made of the regional development agencies in the administration of the European Regional Development Fund in the United Kingdom."</quote>
It is clear that there is a serious problem here and that we have not satisfactorily worked out in this country the method of involving the regions in the preparation of projects and programmes. I should welcome a comment from the Minister on that. It will be
<col>156</col>
interesting to learn the Government's view of how the situation can be improved.<lb/>
Of course, all the other large member states have elected regional authorities as well as regional administrative machinery. The United Kingdom has no elected regional authorities and its regional machinery has been reduced. The importance of the regions to the development of the Community cannot be over-emphasised. We on these Benches believe that elected regional government in this country could ensure, among many other benefits, that the best possible use is made of the regional fund.<lb/>
Finally, I come to the need for a comprehensive and significant overall regional policy for the Community. The European Regional Development Fund is one arm of Community regional policy but is there yet an overall policy embracing all the arms of EC policy, including the CAP? I am not clear that there is, and I should like to ask the Minister to say whether he has discerned such a policy, and what the Government are doing to promote such a policy.<lb/>
I would say in conclusion that within such a policy a vital role could be played by a larger European Regional Development Fund, providing genuinely additional resources in close association with regional authorities, working within nationally agreed guidelines. I believe that we must do all that we can to move things in that direction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00760">4.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00761"><member>Lord Bancroft</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, much of what I wanted to say has already been said by the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, with lapidary precision. He guided the subcommittee with the same deftness during our deliberations. During his remarks he defined the policy which the ERDF is there to serve:
<quote>"to aid the improvement of economic performance in the poorer regions of the Community, with particular emphasis on job creation".</quote>
At the end of its fourth examination of regional policy, the committee concluded, rightly or wrongly&#x2014;I think rightly&#x2014;that this definition remains valid, both despite and because of the changes which have taken place during the past eight years. But the committee also felt that both the fund and the policy which it serves need regular examination, not least because both have their critics.<lb/>
There are those who are opposed in principle to Community regional aid in its present form. We have heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, a reasoned statement of that case, put forward with spirit and vigour. That view I respect and understand. There are also those, who have not as yet had a voice in this House, who oppose national regional aid. That view I neither understand nor agree with. In that context a totally untrammelled market place and market forces seem to me neither surrogates nor substitutes for common sense.<lb/>
The energising forces of the market&#x2014;and they are energising&#x2014;need to be adjusted at the margins: encouraged here a bit, restrained there a bit. Regional policy, after all, is only one small component of the total adjustment process, which includes fiscal policy, public expenditure policy, employment policy and
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0087"/>
<col>157</col>
physical planning policy&#x2014;a whole range of policies of different sorts.<lb/>
In truth, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, said, regional aid represents only a small charge on the Community budget&#x2014;between 5 per cent. and 8 per cent., as compared with about 65 per cent. for the common agricultural policy. It is therefore a modest piece of Community policy, with perhaps rather too much of it to be modest about. National regional aid, as has been said, is of course much bigger, but it is still marginal in terms of gross domestic product and total public expenditure.<lb/>
So far as Community policy is concerned&#x2014;and so long as there is an ERDF&#x2014;I think most of us would agree that we owe it to our deprived regions to secure for them a share of the development fund. We have contributed to it; they have contributed to it. There is no charity involved. It should be, but, alas, too often is not, an investment vehicle. I repeat that our objective ought to be to use it sensibly and, where at all possible, profitably for our poorer areas. I think that the record of successive British Governments in achieving that objective has on the whole not been a bad one, though there is room for improvement&#x2014;but, after all, there always is.<lb/>
How can we best continue to pursue that objective? I ask the question on the assumption that we are not suddenly going to turn our backs on the concept of regional policy and a European regional development fund&#x2014;we are not going to turn our backs on it either out of settled conviction or in pursuit of an ideological whim.<lb/>
The committee's report makes a number of suggestions on that point, and I intend to pursue just two of them. To a certain extent I shall be a bit repetitive but I hope not too much. By way of preface, I observe, as previous speakers have done, that any national government can if it wishes (and most of them, alas, do) frustrate much of the policy and its instrument by a simple device&#x2014;that is, to dock national aid to its regions by the amount that it receives from a fund. We then have no additionality. The fund's support for that country thus becomes a very cumbrous way of shovelling negative amounts of money (if I may use that curious term) across the frontiers of Europe.<lb/>
My two points are these. First, following the noble Lord, Lord Banks, I ask whether the balance between infrastructure and industrial development is right. I suppose that one answer is that they both form part of a continuum and that it is rather profitless to talk about rightness in that context. But, as the noble Lord observed, it is interesting that in the last three years almost 90 per cent. of the fund Community-wide has gone on infrastructure projects. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned&#x2014;and this time taking an eight-year period&#x2014;about 30 per cent. of the projects financed from the fund's quota section were industrial and 70 per cent. infrastructure. This 30/70 split compares with a West German split of 60/40 over the same period, but I think that it is generally agreed that the German trend is, in gardening terms, a sport. The Community-wide bias, Germany excepted, in favour of infrastructure is partly&#x2014;perhaps mainly&#x2014;a
<col>158</col>
reflection of the fact that private industry does not want to invest in the poorer regions.<lb/>
As the noble Baroness implied, unless governments, and the Commission, are prepared to face that issue, the basic policy underpinning the fund will remain faintly unreal. There are two extreme scenarios: on the one hand, cutting losses in these regions and moving people out of them into jobs; on the other, moving productive jobs to people in the deprived regions. In practice, as we know, a mix of both is bound to be involved. But what seems to be a doubtful course is to pour investment into the infrastructure and then simply hold one's thumbs and hope that that in itself will attract enough industrial investment. It does not always happen, as the under-used trunk road network in North-West and North-East England demonstrates. In short, incentives for private productive industry in the deprived regions remain an essential element.<lb/>
This leads me to my second and last point. It is the case that structure, organisation, administration, management, call it what you will, is the servant of policy. It is not a policy end in itself. It should be made, however, to serve the ends of policy efficiently. I think that all of us would agree with that. As already noted by earlier speakers, there is room for the organisation both of the Commission and of the Council of Ministers to be tilted a bit more in the direction of purposeful decision-making and action-taking. The fact that regional development policy, with its industrial and employment detail and importance, and its funding, should be dealt with by the Council of Foreign Ministers has really a touch of Ruritania about it. But it is, in fact, deadly serious. There ought, surely, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, pointed out, to be a forum for the more relevant Ministers to meet, discuss, decide and act.<lb/>
In the case of England, the report comments not unkindly that
<quote>"regional planning appears to be undertaken at present in a vacuum".</quote>
This is at a time when, and I quote the report again:
<quote>"Community pressures are now pointing Member States in the direction of regional planning".</quote>
The report notes that it was the Commission that indicated that there were major gaps in member states' own regional incentive schemes regarding the development and application of innovation in small firms. No one, least of all myself, wants to see more layers of expensive officialdom. But so long as we have an ERDF, I think that there is a case for making what exists, or used to exist, work a bit better. I note without comment the abolition of the regional economic planning councils, themselves an unpaid system of decentralised consultation. I note, too, the resulting attenuation in the roles of the regional economic planning boards.<lb/>
I think that I am probably the last Member of this House to believe that deep-seated problems can be solved by some artful juggling of the machinery of government. I doubt, for example, whether any form of physical activity was materially assisted by the creation of the office of Minister for Sport and Children's Play. None the less, I do commend to your Lordships the report's suggestion that a single Minister and department should be designated to take the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0088"/>
<col>159</col>
lead&#x2014;not to take the sole responsibility, but to take the lead&#x2014;in handling regional policy.<lb/>
I conclude by saying that much has happened to the machinery of government&#x2014;perhaps, indeed, too much&#x2014;since the 1970 White Paper on the reorganisation of central government. This stated that the Department of the Environment would have the leading responsibility for regional policy but that the Department of Trade and Industry would retain responsibility for certain economic aspects including industrial development in the regions. That was a bit of a fudge. And, despite all that has been done, said and written, some of it very recently, on the subject, it does remain a bit of a fudge still on the ground. It has not helped in the formation of a coherent regional policy. I fancy that the unemployed men and women in Skinningrove and Millom do not really spend their evenings discussing nice points about the machinery of government. But they do care about the effects that it has on the prosperity of their region.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00762">4.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00763"><member>Lord Tranmire</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, has, with great clarity, exposed the problems covered by this report. Those of us who served on the sub-committee I know would wish me to pay tribute to the unfailing courtesy and the penetrating wisdom that he used when he occupied the chair. Having been over this course four times, I have come to know some of the fences, particularly the rather awesome water jump, "Additionality". It has perhaps left me, rather like my noble friend Lady Carnegy, with some misgivings about the European Regional Development Fund. Coming straight to the water jump, the principle of "additionality" was meant as a safeguard against reimbursement of national budgetary expenditure. It is quite incapable of proof and may be inclined in fact to encourage evasive tactics in certain of the member states.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bancroft, talked about the division between infrastructure and industrial problems. It is not surprising that there has been a great decline in the number of applications for industrial grant in all countries of the Community when you realise that a successful applicant never handles the grant. It is quite immaterial to him whether the application succeeds or is rejected, except that if it succeeds he probably gets rather more involved in bureaucracy than he does otherwise. Even in the case of the infrastructure investment application, the only advantage really that the successful applicant gets is that he will have his loan charges somewhat reduced. I do not know what the solution is. I do not attempt to offer a solution. But it is I think an inherent defect of the ERDF.<lb/>
What is clear, as I think all speakers have agreed, is that today the need for help towards regional development is more pressing than ever. Although the ERDF budget, as the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, has pointed out, has increased sevenfold since its inception, regional disparities are more wide today than they were in 1975. Rising unemployment throughout the Community and prospect of the results of enlargement have aggravated and changed the nature of the problem. Notwithstanding these facts, Mr. Mathijsen,<lb/>
<col>160</col>
the director general responsible for the Regional Development Fund, told the Committee in evidence:
<quote>"Maybe regional policy as such does not exist. It is rather regional politics that exist".</quote>
He described the regional fund as just an instrument towards a policy.<lb/>
I am afraid that I keep on having to repeat what the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, has said because he has covered the report so well. Although there are at Brussels a Council for Social Policy, a Council for Agriculture, a Council for Industry, a Council for Finance and a Council for Economics, there is no Council for Regional Policy. The regional fund is to a certain extent circumscribed by each Government's decision in declaring an area to be an assisted area even though, as a consequence of that, areas denied assisted area status may be in greater need of regional help than areas in other member states that are receiving grants.<lb/>
A further weakness I believe is where industrial problems are closely linked with the agricultural problems in less favoured areas. While the former are assisted by the European Regional Development Fund, with all the limitations that noble Lords have outlined, the latter are more generously provided for by the Agricultural Guidance Fund. On enlargement, this will become even more evident. Already it has led the Commission to create an integrated development programme for the Mediterranean countries. The Court of Auditors, in their last report, criticised the vagueness of the screening by the Commission for some of the project's finance.<lb/>
How far can Britain's regional policies be solved by an integrated development programme? We really have only the example of the Belfast integrated programme to guide us. This has been extremely slow in producing results, leading to the suspicion that the Community's administrative machine is not geared for such programmes and that the Regional Development Fund has not sufficient staff to oversee them. That was admitted by the director-general in charge of regional policy.<lb/>
Although we should beware of creating more bureaucratic log-jams at Brussels, the solution may possibly be&#x2014;I suggest&#x2014;to hive off the European Agricultural Guidance Fund from the Council of Agriculture and attach it to a new Council for Regional Policy, so that the problems of industry and the less favoured areas may be together under one council at Brussels. This development, I believe, might encourage the richer countries of the Community to take more interest in, and to be more generous to, the European Regional Development Fund.<lb/>
In conclusion, I wish to stress that while the new regulation represents a substantial advance upon its predecessors, the Regional Development Fund could be doing far more to rectify disparities throughout the Community. Its future success will depend on the progress it makes with integrated development operations and how far these can raise the standard of living in areas of industrial decline, in travel-to-work areas and in agricultural, less-favoured areas. It would appear that the Commission has at present inadequate staff to tackle these problems and has not the overall policy required for this purpose. I believe that it is in
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0089"/>
<col>161</col>
the interests of the Community that further thought should be given to devoting more of its initiative and resources to reducing the disparities throughout the enlarged Community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00764">4.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00765"><member>Lord Ezra</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to intervene very briefly in this debate, so ably introduced by the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien. I wish to make only one point. That point is to remind ourselves that the Community's regional development policy can form only one part of a wider-ranging initiative which is now required to address itself to the basic economic, industrial and social problems facing the Community as a whole.<lb/>
As my noble friend Lord Banks made clear, the Regional Development Fund is in itself now totally inadequate to achieve the objective for which it was initially proposed. Less than I per cent. of the Community's overall GDP is clearly not going to be sufficient to deal with the massive regional disparities which exist within the Community. This limited fund has itself been further weakened by the lack of the application of additionality, as many noble Lords have made clear.<lb/>
But, of course, since the fund was introduced in its present form in 1975, and subsequently revised, a lot has happened in the world, as the report itself makes clear. It would seem to me that, now that the major budgetary problems have been overcome, the next biggest question to which the Community should be addressing itself is the whole problem of how we try to deal with the basic economic difficulties within the Community. It might well be that as a result of such a review a much larger Regional Development Fund, under new principles and new guidelines, would be required. Therefore, although that fund and its allocation have recently been reviewed, I should like to suggest that the time might well be near when we should be looking at this whole question on a much wider basis.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00767"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, tribute has already been paid by other speakers to the reasoned way in which this report has been introduced by the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien of Lothbury. I should like to add my tribute to his conduct as chairman of this committee. This is the second report with which I have been privileged to be associated under his chairmanship. While we spend long hours listening to witnesses and reading evidence in the room upstairs, one must occasionally ask oneself whether it is worthwhile. I hope the speeches that have been made this afternoon will continue the process begun by an earlier report&#x2014;a complicated report on membership of the European Monetary Fund&#x2014;which seemed to revive a general interest in that matter. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, and his colleagues will feel encouraged to use their talents, their probing, their objectivity in the interests of this House and the production of reports similar to the one that is before us this afternoon.<lb/>
<col>162</col>
As has been pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, this is regional policy day in the House of Lords. We have already passed the Cooperative Development Agency and Industrial Development Bill, which provides for the restructuring of regional assistance. A White Paper already exists and the map of the restructuring of regional assistance is promised and I welcome very much the assurance of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, that that will be the subject of debate, because some of us have a great deal to say about it even if I cannot match the eloquence of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington.<lb/>
The question of regional aid, with which this report is associated, is of great importance. Anyone who, like the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, and me, lives in Scotland, will appreciate how significant is the application of regional aid in the reconstruction of the devastated areas of the Scottish economy. One thinks of firms like Motoralo, East Kilbride, National Semiconductor at Greenock, IBM, Hoffman Laroche in Dairy. Eighty per cent. of UK production of intergrated circuits now takes place in Scotland. This does not happen by accident, and questionnaires sent to the firms concerned, which have expanded their investment in Scotland, confirm that regional assistance is a very important factor in making these decisions.<lb/>
Yet many of us, not only in Scotland but in other parts of the country represented in this House, are increasingly apprehensive about the Government's intentions as regards regional aid. I refer to the report of the committee on the Industrial Development Act which has just been published, of which my late colleague and good friend Bill Mackworth Young was chairman. The report points out that from the quality of the cases which it considered:
<quote>"the board remains of the view that selective financial assistance has a vital role to play in developing the industrial strength of the United Kingdom, particularly so in the new high technology areas".</quote>
Yet the report contains some interesting facts. For example, automatic grants to special development areas and to development areas dropped by more than a third to &#x00A3;438 million in the year to 31st March 1984 compared with &#x00A3;689 million in the previous year.<lb/>
So the cut in regional assistance is already being imposed. What is particularly significant for people who live in Scotland and who have benefited from regional aid is that the highest fall affected Scotland and payments fell by half to &#x00A3;142 million compared with &#x00A3;287 million in the previous year. As the <i>Financial Times</i> said when referring to this report:
<quote>"These figures will make especially grim reading".</quote>
We are in a situation where regional aid can make an important contribution to restructuring industry and creating economic growth. These cuts have already been imposed and a few more are no doubt promised in the redrawing of the map which will shortly come before us.<lb/>
In Europe, just as in the United Kingdom, there can be no sense of community if there is a wide divergence in standards of living. If we have an increasing disparity in the standards of living and the state of economic well-being in the constituent parts of Europe we shall never develop a strong sense of community. I
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0090"/>
<col>163</col>
as a pro-European and the Alliance Benches&#x2014;who are committed to Europe even if occasionally it is unpopular&#x2014;believe strongly in the strengthening of the European Community, and we wish to support any efforts which will prevent the regional disparities from widening. In our own life, in our own country and in our own cities we know that the division between rich and poor is the most destructive element in the establishment of happy communites.<lb/>
As has been said by other speakers, there is a total inadequacy in the &#x00A3;1 billion which is spent under the fund on projects throughout the Community. As has been said in the report at paragraph 84:
<quote>"Member States' own regional spending account for at least ten times and sometimes up to 50 times this amount".</quote>
Nevertheless, although the ERDF contribution is limited in the total picture of regional aid, at the same time it is an important gesture, it is an important symbol of European interest in this important area. I always hoped that the lobby of the unemployed in Europe might be almost as powerful as the lobby of the French farmers.<lb/>
It is very disappointing when we look at United Kingdom regional policy to find that in paragraph 93 dealing with the subject of additionality, which has been much aired this afternoon, the report says:
<quote>"evidence from the Department of Trade and Industry, is not encouraging, since it seems that the United Kingdom is expecting the ERDF to pay in future for a higher share (in money terms) of a much reduced national regional aid scheme".</quote>
So the Government are practising something of a sleight of hand hoping to attract more money from the European fund and at the same time cutting drastically the aid from the Exchequer.<lb/>
I was particularly interested in the evidence that was received from the local authorities during the Committee's consideration of this matter. The Strathclyde Region and other regional authorities made it abundantly clear that so long as the fund is centrally administered the whole thing looks like a handout from Whitehall, and the sense of European involvement in assisting regional development is not fully realised. That is not helpful to those of us who are anxious to develop the European idea, and the importance of Europe in providing regional aid is frequently not recognised.<lb/>
May I also draw your Lordships' attention to paragraph 98. While we recognise that the present &#x00A3;1 billion spread over Europe is inadequate, we are shortly to be faced with the possible entry of Spain and Portugal who will also be claimants on the fund, and we shall never be able to discharge our Community responsibilities unless there is a substantial increase to take care of the new members.<lb/>
I hope that the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien of Lothbury, will not feel that his labours have been in vain in producing this excellent report. I can only hope that the Government in replying to this debate will give assurances that this is a matter of high priority. I hope that they will give certain assurances with regard to the promised new policy in support of regional aid. I hope they can assure us that it will not be a case of depending to a much greater extent on European aid in order to get the Exchequer off the hook.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00768">5.7 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00769"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Select Committee's Report on the European Development Fund, No. 274, is one of the most interesting reports that it has been my privilege to read since I have had the honour to be a Member of your Lordships' House. It has been most cogently put together. It is not only that the conclusions of the committee have commanded such support this afternoon; it is not only that the recommendations are important; but some of the evidence which has been given by officials of the departments concerned has been most illuminating and more informative than some ministerial utterances to which we have been privileged to listen from time to time. It is a report that should command the widest attention; and for my part I should like also to offer my congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien of Lothbury, for the very calm and dispassionate way (I was almost going to say the unenthusiastic way) in which he introduced it.<lb/>
Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the contributions that have come from all sides of the House this afternoon have cast a little doubt on the efficacy of the European Regional Development Fund. I believe that there is a little unease as regards its administration; and to say the least, there has certainly been a degree of unease about the way in which Her Majesty's Government have delt with the question of additionality. In fact, in expressing my own appreciation to the Select Committee and its members I am bound to say, somewhat uniquely for me, that I have found very little in any speech delivered by any Member of your Lordships' House this afternoon with which I can violently disagree.<lb/>
I well recall when the European Regional Development Fund came into existence. If I may venture to remind your Lordships, it was the result of the Dublin re-negotiations which took place in 1974, which were a prelude to a referendum that was held in this country in 1975 as to whether or not we should remain in the European Community. I well recall the arguments that were adduced in those days concerning the strong desirability of this country for retaining its membership; and one of the reasons given for that was the vista that was held out to Europe, and particularly to the United Kingdom, of what the establishment of the European Regional Development Fund would do. A new directorate was created. We were assured that it would develop into an instrument that would powerfully assist in the vast discrepancies of resources of fortune that existed throughout Europe and, indeed, in this country.<lb/>
What has happened in the event? The point was made very well by the noble Lord, Lord Tranmire, I thought&#x2014;and it is undoubtedly true, and is in the report&#x2014;that despite this the richer areas of Europe have become richer and the poorer areas have become poorer. There is now no doubt about that at all. It is within the context of that undoubted fact that we have to consider this report and the suggestions that it makes.<lb/>
The Members of your Lordships' House who were members of the Select Committee were at one that the funds at the disposal of the European Regional Development Fund should be substantially increased
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0091"/>
<col>165</col>
in exactly the same way as that renowned firm of accountants who investigated the operation of the regional policy in the North-East recommended that the state contribution in this country ought to be doubled from &#x00A3;600 million to &#x00A3;1,200 million. The noble Lord the Minister will recall the report because I referred to it in an earlier contribution that I was privileged to make in another debate.<lb/>
What are the possibilities? As a former member of the European Parliament, as one who was interested in budgetary matters and who for a little time was the president of the European Parliament's regional committee, I shall recount to your Lordships exactly what happens. In the preliminary draft budget as submitted to the European Parliament the Commission includes certain suggestions as to the total amount of payments into the Regional Development Fund during the year. It does this in two ways. It lays down the figures which it thinks the payments should be limited to, and, on top of that and absorbing them, what commitments should be allowed to be entered into in regard to the regional fund. The preliminary draft budget is then considered by the Parliament, by its regional affairs committee and by the Parliament's budgetary committee, which invariably add a very significant sum to that suggested by the Commission. Amendments are put down and are ultimately passed, and the preliminary draft budget as amended by Parliament goes to the Council of Ministers.<lb/>
There is one thing of which we can be dead certain&#x2014;and this has applied right from the beginning, and still applies. Any significant increase in the Regional Development Fund or, for that matter, the Social Fund is invariably turned down by the Council of Ministers, on which our own Government are fully represented, because, of course, as many noble Lords have pointed out this afternoon, agricultural expenditure (which is sacrosanct, which is completely out of control and which, in point of fact, is demand-led) invariably squashes everything else out of the budget. The draft budget is returned from the Council of Ministers to Parliament with possibly a token increase over the original suggestion for regional aid, but certainly it does not concede power.<lb/>
I have been present at numerous conciliation proceedings between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in which our own representatives, including those of a previous Administration&#x2014;I want to be quite fair to the noble Lord the Minister&#x2014;have invariably resisted any significant increases in this fund. I venture to suggest that the prospects of increasing it this time are fairly remote.<lb/>
One other matter has to be borne in mind. It is alleged that the application of the Regional Development Fund, even at its reduced level and even at a level which is inadequate, is some heaven-sent benefit conferred by the European Community on the places which ultimately benefit from grants from the fund. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, touched upon this indirectly when he referred to the question of additionality. But there is an additional factor, because in the course of evidence that was given by Mr. Walmsley at page 15 of the report he said:
<quote>"we already contribute 22 per cent of the 24 per cent we take out [of the European Development Fund]".</quote>
<col>166</col>
It is all very well to say that we have had this contribution to this or that part of Scotland or Wales and notices are required to be displayed saying, "This development is with the aid of the European Community", and so on. In point of fact we contribute 22 per cent. of the fund and take out 24 per cent., and the benefit to the United Kingdom is exactly 2 per cent., which is a fact that is not generally recognised. Indeed, miniscule though it may be&#x2014;and the profit is &#x00A3;25 million in all&#x2014;it is the one profitable item to be offset against these thousands or millions of pounds that go directly from the United Kingdom taxpayers' pockets into the agricultural fund for the subsidisation not only of our own farmers but of others. Those are the facts.<lb/>
Therefore, after a lapse of nine years from its establishment one cannot wonder why a sign of disillusionment, however politely expressed, begins to creep in as to the effectiveness of this part of the EEC. Added to that there is the question of additionality. The committee expressed itself temperately on this matter, but on going through the evidence upon which it based its judgment&#x2014;and I have been all through every bit of the evidence incorporated in the report&#x2014;there can be no doubt whatsoever that the United Kingdom, before it determines what it is itself going to spend in connection with the distressed, the special development and the development areas of this country, should take into account what it expects to get out of the Regional Development Fund. There is abundant evidence of it. And yet when they speak in the Council of Ministers and elsewhere they pay tribute to the whole question of additionality.<lb/>
On financial grounds one of course cannot complain, because it saves money. It saves a contribution, or part thereof, into the European Community itself. But for any Government really concerned with bringing aid to the distressed areas of this country&#x2014;and there are now hundreds with unemployment going above the average of 12 per cent.&#x2014;to avoid additionality by what amounts to, in Community terms, a subterfuge is not something for which it should take great credit.<lb/>
I found myself in considerable agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, in what she said. What she said is true: applications go in for regional aid; they are vetted by the government department; they then go up to the Commission itself&#x2014;DG 16, I think it is&#x2014;and they are considered there. Then, once every three months there is a management committee composed of representatives of all the nations. Usually they are ambassadors, or people who are appointed by the ambassadors, who solemnly get round the table and determine the carve-up. After that projects are approved, and they come back. I agree with the noble Baroness that all this, going right the way through channels up and down again, must be costly. It may satisfy those who desire, or who have any lingering desire, to preserve the reputation of the Community as an institution, as a mere fig leaf to show the world that it is useful, but in financial terms it is not very productive.<lb/>
One of the most remarkable things is the extent to which local authorities themselves are involved. With the permission of your Lordships I shall give a quotation from the report which indicates the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0092"/>
<col>167</col>
ambivalence of the Government in this matter. At page 8 of the evidence your Lordships will find that my noble friend Lady Llewelyn-Davies of Hastoe asked Mr. Walmsley, of the Department of Trade and Industry, the following question:
<quote>"When you apply for grant do you have to have local authority support for your project to begin with or can you apply without that?"</quote>
That seems to be a question which should be capable of an immediate and direct answer. But the reply given by Mr. Walmsley, I think your Lordships will find, was slightly reminiscent of the style adopted in, "Yes, Minister". Mr. Walmsley did not reply whether the local authority came into the picture or not. These are the words he used:
<quote>"In the case of infrastructure projects, the only projects which are eligible are those which are financed by the public sector in one form or another".</quote>
This was the way in which the direct question of my noble friend was answered. Whereas, of course, we all know perfectly well, and it is made clear in the evidence&#x2014;and this was touched upon by the noble Lord, Lord Banks, and the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, and indeed by other noble Lords&#x2014;that the local authorities are virtually excluded from any creative participation in the ERDF or, for that matter, in the development of regional policy.<lb/>
There are emphatic statements in the report to that effect. This is not surprising when one considers the remarks made by Professor Goddard, who gave evidence before the committee on the state of regional planning. The committee itself arrived at the conclusion that regional planning in England appears to be undertaken at present in a vacuum. At page 36 of the evidence, in reply to a question by the noble Lord, Lord Croham, Professor Goddard, of the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said this:
<quote>"The problem is that at the present time we do not have a machinery for regional economic development planning in the United Kingdom and it might be quite difficult to prepare those sorts of programmes because we have put the machinery on one side for the time being".</quote>
I am merely quoting from the report, but if anything that the report has said is inaccurate then I shall be glad if the noble Lord would correct me. If the report is incorrect in saying that there is no machinery for regional economic planning, then, if there is, perhaps the noble Lord will tell us what it is. If there is not, it of course explains the strange reluctance to which I referred in a previous debate to set out any future plans for what regional development is going to be in this country.<lb/>
I regrettably have to agree with the sentiment expressed, I thought somewhat wistfully, by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Gryfe, when he inferred that the Regional Development Fund is rather more of a symbol than anything else of the existence of the Community at this time in any fields outside the CAP. Surely, has not the time come when we ought to admit that the emperor has no clothes, and when to these peripheral activities (including the European Regional Development Fund), however much we ought to support them&#x2014;and I agree this on the basis of getting as much as we can for our own country, ourselves being a net contributor to the Community&#x2014;we ought
<col>168</col>
to give such support with our eyes wide open, and not place any great hopes upon their future development?<lb/>
I invite those noble Lords who have not done so to read through this document&#x2014;which, I repeat, is a good and informative document. I sincerely hope they will. I am quite sure that when they have done so they will come to the conclusion that the Select Committee have done a very good job indeed, and that the contributions made in your Lordships' House this afternoon have been well worth while and are a tribute to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00770">5.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00771"><member>Lord Lucas of Chilworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, and indeed the Select Committee as a whole on the wealth of information they have managed to pack into what is, as the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington has said, a most interesting and informative report. At this time perhaps I may also thank all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate this afternoon, which has made it most interesting.<lb/>
As we are about to enter a new phase of the fund's activities this is a good moment to take stock. I deal first with the general but important question of enlargement of the Community, which has been touched upon by one or two noble Lords.<lb/>
Although recommending a proportional increase in ERDF resources on the entry of Spain and Portugal, the Committee quite properly related this to future development of the overall budgetary resources of the Community. This is also the Government's position. The Government welcome the forthcoming accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community, which we believe is in the interest of all member states.<lb/>
The fund's declared aim under the old 1975 regulation was to "correct the principal imbalances within the Community." The new regulation rather more sensibly moderates this to contributing to the correction of these imbalances. For as the Committee have pointed out in paragraph 84&#x2014;and I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Banks, made this point&#x2014;member states' own regional spending is very much larger than spending by the ERDF. This will continue to be so. It is sensible that the principal role of the ERDF should continue to be to contribute to and support member states' own regional policies.<lb/>
As regards the future under the new regulation, which was adopted on 19th June 1984, from the Commission's first proposals in 1981 through to the amended proposals of last year, the United Kingdom has pressed for early agreement of a new regulation in pursuit of its belief that the ERDF should continue to develop, with the conviction that every opportunity should be taken to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the fund's operations. I am glad to note that the weight of the evidence recieved by the committee has led them in their own report&#x2014;and this is also true of the weight of comment by nearly every noble Lord who has contributed this afternoon&#x2014;to welcome the new regulation. This is also the Governments' view, and our aim is to make the new regulation work and to work well.<lb/>
It was perhaps disappointing for both the Government and the Commission that it did not prove possible to reach complete agreement between member states on the Commission's original 1981
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0093"/>
<col>169</col>
proposals. It is perhaps not surprising that new proposals for allocating resources should have given rise to difficulties, particularly when they would have meant that most member states would have received little or nothing. The Committee has, in fact, noted that there may be important political advantages in allowing every member state to have a share of the fund and there is something to be said for that view. I note the distinction that my noble friend Lady Carnegy made in this respect.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, made some comment with regard to the United Kingdom's input and net receipts. It is difficult totally to foresee how the new system will operate in practice. What is clear is that the United Kingdom can now aspire to 28.56 per cent. of the fund by comparison with our previous 23.8 per cent. The House may be sure that the Government will be pressing very hard indeed for such a share. Whether we can achieve this will depend on a variety of circumstances, many of which are outside our control, and not least the bids submitted by other member states and the extent to which we may or may not benefit from any Community programmes proposed by the Commission.<lb/>
The other big changes have been in the operation of the fund. All member states want improved efficiency in the operation of the fund. We therefore attach considerable importance to the provisions in the new regulation for the financing of programmes rather than a multiplicity of individual projects. We are now considering, with the Commission, how to make best use of these new arrangements.<lb/>
In the case of Community programmes, the Commission must first make a framework proposal to the Council, which the Council may then adopt by qualified majority&#x2014;so here there will be no question of a one-state veto. The detail of the Community programmes would be settled in the same way as that of national programmes&#x2014;by the member states concerned and the Commission, in consultation with the fund management committee. However, there is one important and reasonable qualification: a Community programme could not be approved without the agreement of a member state in whose territory it would apply. I think that is only right. That is set down in Article 7, Section 2.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Tranmire, among others, spoke upon the subject of Community procedures. I note particularly the Select Committee's proposal that regional policy should be dealt with by a specific Council of Ministers rather than by the Foreign Affairs Council. That is in paragraph 98 of the report. There may have been an argument for this when the ERDF regulation was under review, though not necessarily, I would suggest, a convincing argument. Now, however, that the new regulation has been settled, the Government do not believe there would be sufficient ministerial work to warrant setting up a separate council. The Government will not therefore be pursuing this proposal for the time being. However we recognise the case for <i>ad hoc</i> meetings of Ministers particularly responsible for regional policy.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bancroft, asked about who might take the overall lead. I noted that the committee recommends that for England there should be a
<col>170</col>
leading Minister and department to handle regional policy. How one reads that recommendation is, I think, open to question, because I believe that the recommendation itself has arisen from a misunderstanding. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has overall responsibility for regional policy for all the United Kingdom, but this should not obscure the fact that he is also the Minister who takes the overall lead for regional policy questions in England.<lb/>
Of course, my right honourable friend does not work in isolation. The Secretary of State's White Paper on Regional Industrial Development, dealing with the review of regional industrial policy, referred to the need to take account of the regional dimensions in a wide range of central and local government policies, and to the close working relationship between the Department of Trade and Industry and other departments. Decisions are always taken in close consultation with all interested departments of state. The valuable and essential contributions made particularly by the Scottish, the Welsh and the Northern Ireland departments and by, among others, the Departments of the Environment, Energy and Transport are all taken into account.<lb/>
The committee's report refers to "gaps in the machinery of regional administration" and to the Government's reappraisal of regional planning in 1979. I would remind the House that the regional planning at that time was primarily concerned with the use of land. At no time were the tripartite regional planning strategies or the appointed regional economic planning councils capable of directing the scale and location of capital investment undertaken by the public authorities charged with providing infrastructure services, still less the commercial and industrial developments undertaken by the private sector.<lb/>
The committee also raised the important question of the link between United Kingdom regional policy and eligibility for ERDF assistance. This was in paragraph 97. The report suggests that the Government's regional industrial development White Paper raised doubts about the future direction of United Kingdom regional policy in this country and in particular whether there will be a sufficient number of projects and sufficiently wide coverage by assisted area or other status to provide an adequate number of industrial and service projects. The White Paper clearly spelt out the Government's firm commitment to an effective domestic regional policy. We discussed this earlier this afternoon and indeed last week and I think therefore that it would not be helpful if I returned to the arguments that I deployed earlier.<lb/>
Perhaps I may turn to some of the more general points which were made during the course of our interesting debate and to one about which without exception&#x2014;unless perhaps it was the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, in his brief intervention&#x2014;all noble Lords spoke. That is the question of additionality. This, I believe, is an issue which, again, is often the subject of misunderstanding. The principle that it expressses is that grants should not lead to reduction in national expenditure. The report suggests in paragraph 79 that the supposed lack of additionality may discourage
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0094"/>
<col>171</col>
local authorities from making application to the ERDF.<lb/>
The simple fact is that this additionality can only be provided for at the level of overall public expenditure planning; and that is exactly what we do. The Government plan their expenditure on the basis that a certain level of ERDF receipts will be forthcoming; with the result that the total level of expenditure&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;is higher than it would be without those receipts. The total number of projects which can be implemented is obviously greater. Quite contrary to what the Committee has implied, this practice has by no means discouraged local authorities from applying for support for their projects. Quite the reverse! They fall over themselves to secure assisted-area status and the coveted ERDF eligibility; because by this means they are able to undertake more, and perhaps even more expensive, projects.<lb/>
The Committee's report also suggested in paragraph 80 that greater visibility in relation to ERDF receipts in the national accounts of member states would be an advance. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the public expenditure White Paper already shows the expected amount of ERDF receipts alongside the planned levels of domestic expenditure under the same headings; and separate ERDF figures are also given in the supply estimates and the appropriation accounts. My noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour spoke about the administrative costs of the operation of ERDF. Regrettably, the administrative costs in any system of regional aid are fairly high. We recognise this and this is why the Government hope to make good use of the new provisions that there are for the national programmes.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, in his speech and I think also the noble Lord, Lord Banks, in his, spoke about the need for the creation of permanent employment. The committee recommended that more attention should be given to the creation of this, particularly with the help of ERDF. So far as we are concerned, I remind noble Lords that the Government made clear in the White Paper on regional industrial development that their own view is that it is essential to ensure that regional policies are effective in creating genuine jobs. Again, we discussed that earlier this afternoon. Both the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, and Lord Banks, spoke about the development agencies. I noted what they had to say about development agencies to cover the whole country.<lb/>
But, with respect, regional policy is about a part of the country rather than about the whole. It is true that there are no agencies in England that are comparable with the Scottish and the Welsh Development Agencies; but, through the activities that are carried on through the regional offices and the discussions that take place with local authorities, we feel that although the package may be a different shape, the contents are essentially the same. Much was said by a number of noble Lords, notably, I think, by the noble Lord, Lord Bancroft, about the industry infrastructure balance. This was a point that the committee noted. This imbalance to which he referred is quite simply because the Community's economic situation, coupled with the large growth of the fund and its restrictive rules, has made it impossible for most member states to
<col>172</col>
maintain the 70/30 infrastructure industry balance which was provided for in the old regulations. Last year it would have been quite impossible for the Commission to have used all the available resources of the fund if the Council had not waived that provision. The new regulation sensibly provides that member states and the Commission should merely try to allocate at least 30 per cent. of the fund to industry projects. I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Bancroft, made a comparison between the United Kingdom and Germany. The fact is that there have not been enough industrial applications coming forward that, even had they been accepted, would have brought our 70/30 balance more into line with what I believe the noble Lord sees as the more ideal situation which obtains in Germany.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, said that ERDF resources should be expanded proportionately on the entry of Spain and Portugal. I suppose that that is a fair comment and I suppose that when any grant or fund is set up there are those who say for a variety of reasons that there should be more spent or that it should be expanded. I think that we have to accept that, in considering the ERDF budget more broadly, it is noteworthy that the fund has grown since its inception in 1975, when expenditure was &#x00A3;125 million, to &#x00A3;1,220 million or so this year. The fund, I believe, is unlikely to grow at the same rate in coming years but the United Kingdom firmly supports the conclusion of the Brussels European Council that the financial resources allocated to aid from the fund should continue to increase in real terms, again within the limits of financing possibilities. I take much account of what was contained in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, on that subject.<lb/>
A number of other interesting points arose. They were perhaps more expressions of view than questions addressed to me. I think that I have answered those that were specifically put in that spirit. Perhaps I may conclude therefore by saying that I thank the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, and the Members of the select committee for their report. This afternoon has been most interesting and it has provided an opportunity to air really important matters. I hope that I have been able to make it clear that the Government are committed to maintaining an effective domestic regional policy. We are committed to a continuing effort to support and develop the work of the European Regional Development Fund, and we are committed to explore the new possibilities which will arise from the implementation of the new regulation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00773"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my first pleasant duty is to thank Her Majesty's Government for enabling this debate to take place this afternoon, and if I may say so at such a civilised hour. I should also like to thank all noble Lords who were good enough to take part in the debate both for their contributions and for the tributes that they have been good enough to pay to the Committee&#x2014;and, indeed, to me. little though that was deserved. The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, said in the course of his remarks that he had agreed with all the speakers up to that point, and I began to wonder where we had gone wrong. But I came to the conclusion that there was one exception
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0095"/>
<col>173</col>
even to the best of rules, and so I decided to press on. He said he thought that my introduction of the report was a little unenthusiastic. We all know that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, is a passionate politician, and I suppose he is a stranger to the cool objectivity which is what I tried to use in my approach to this subject, and indeed so did the Committee as a whole.<lb/>
Certainly I can say that we are not in any way unenthusiastic about the European Community idea. We are certainly not unethusiastic about the great desirability of minimising the disparity between regions in the Community&#x2014;a formidable task at all times. We are not unenthusiastic about the ERDF as such, but we are very worried about the bureaucratic jungle in which it seems to operate in all countries, not least in this, and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, said, the cost involved. Although I could be said to have been a bureaucrat all my life, I have an intense hatred of the creation of mountains of paper by bureaucrats when a straight forward approach to problems could solve them without all that trouble and expense.<lb/>
We have also been greatly troubled by the lack of additionality, as indeed all speakers this afternoon have been; and despite what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, has said. I think we shall remain troubled about that until we see evidence that it has changed. He says that the Government are not willing to set up a Minister in charge of regional affairs. I wonder really how strong the case is for not doing that. If we can have a Minister of Sport, surely regional affairs and the problems associated therewith are infinitely more important even than sport.<lb/>
I was attracted by the proposal made by the noble Lord, Lord Tranmire, that the Agriculture Guidance Fund should be tied up with the Regional Development Fund in our consideration of the future financing of the Community and the place which the Common Agricultural Policy plays in it. We have been worried, as indeed everybody has, by the immense expenditure on the common agricultural policy, and the thought of how this might be minimised by giving help to those who are poor in agriculture, like the hill farmers, without giving blessings to the whole farming community&#x2014;and excessive blessings in many cases. An idea of this sort might help in that direction. I also welcome the plea of the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, for a wider view on this question. It certainly should not be concentrated simply on the operation of the European Development Fund or indeed on the regional policies of individual countries. It is a Community problem of immense importance.<lb/>
The part played by local authorities in this country was also discussed by the Minister and we heard a lot about it in the Committee, of course. The regional authorities do play a part: they do have contracts with Brussels and they value those contacts. It seems to me they could be used in a much more productive manner. I hope we shall see under the new regime which is now being established a greater Community element in the programmes. The Minister has said that if the Community has ideas of a regional policy, each country affected by that policy must agree with it. That is something which I believe is indispensable, but I hope our country in particular, and indeed all
<col>174</col>
European Countries, will approach this desire for a Community element in regional aid positvely and creatively. Again, I thank everybody for taking part in the debate, and the Minister for replying to it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Oil and Gas: Planning Control</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00775">5.54 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00776"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what are their intentions with regard to the draft Department of the Environment/Welsh Office Circular <i>Planning Control over Oil and Gas Operations.</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00777">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg to ask the Unstarred Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. In August this year the Department of the Environment sent out to all local authorities and other interested bodies an advance circular of new guidance lines on the granting of planning consent for the development of on-shore gas and oil in the United Kingdom. The theme of the circular is broadly to encourage the exploration of on-shore oil and gas and development where justified, with a slight bow to the conservation of the environment as being in the best interests of economic recovery, both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00778">Although the circular is published by the Department of the Environment, its guidance on conservation of the environment falls far short of the strength to be expected from the Ministry which is specifically responsible for this. Indeed, I could say with Isaac, being beguiled by Jacob,
<quote>"The hands are the hands of Esau, but the voice is the voice of Jacob".</quote>
The hands are the hands of Department of the Environment but the voice is the voice of the Department of Energy. Towards the end of paragraph 11 of the circular comes this sentence:
<quote>"There is now a wide measure of agreement on all sides that it is feasible to draw up sensible planning policies to balance oil and gas exploration and the protection of the environment".</quote>
If my noble friend Lord Avon or indeed the Secretary of State for the Environment himself will visit the villages bordering on Surrey, West Sussex and Hampshire, where proposals to drill for oil and gas are now becoming public, he will hear a completely different version of the subject. This is an undeveloped&#x2014;and I should declare an immediate personal interest because I live there&#x2014;unspoilt rural area immediately beyond the outer boundary of the London Green Belt and indeed some of it was proposed for an extension of the Green Belt. Virtually all this area is classified as of great landscape value or as areas of outstanding natural beauty. Existing planning controls prohibit any development outside each village area and very tight control within it. Thus the local inhabitants are very conscious of their continuing responsibility for the protection of the beautiful environment in which they live.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00779">I should also draw attention to the fact that the Surrey County Council's structure plan permits development outside villages only to meet needs of agriculture and forestry. So local inhabitants foresee that the drilling of exploration boreholes followed by
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0096"/>
<col>175</col>
exploitation and production wells is going to change the character and amenity of their villages and the surrounding countryside for up to the next 25 years, and change it in a way which is far from pleasant. It would change from being unspoilt countryside to being spoilt countryside. Currently there is a planning application for drilling an exploration well at Dunsfold but it is opposed by the two parish councils of Dunsfold and Alfold and also by the rural district council's planning committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00780">I come now to the precise nature of the damage to the environment which would follow exploitation and production. The boreholes are drilled by a derrick 128 feet high, working day and night, with a heavy noise factor. The estimated time for the exploration is given as only four to six weeks, but I did note that in the neighbouring village of Chiddingfold they took some 38 weeks. If oil is found it will probably take a few months to install the pumps and pipelines; and further disturbance would probably be small. If gas is found the production process is of a completely different nature. An industrial site of some eight to 10 acres is established at each find, equipped with pumps, compressors and other processing plant in order to gather and clean the gas before pumping to the nearest arterial gas pipe.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00781">This industrial site will work 24 hours per day with a noise factor which will be heard in a rural area up to 1&#x00BD; kilometres. It will also have a smell factor, probably hydrogen-sulphide, and also a sight factor, not consonant with rural countryside.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00782">I now return to the DoE circular. This circular makes no mention whatsoever of the difference between gas abstraction and oil abstraction. It gives no guidance at all. It is evident from my description that the damage to the environment from gas abstraction is of a very different nature from oil abstraction, so four questions arise on this. Why does the circular say nothing about the potential objections to gas abstraction? Is the DoE not informed on this?&#x2014;at least they are now. Do they think that planning authorities should ignore these factors? I hope not. And how many full-scale on-shore gas abstractions are there in the United Kingdom? We know that there is some oil. What gas abstractions are there? The impression is given that not very much is known about on-shore gas abstraction and that the DoE is hoping for the best.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00783">Now it happens that the proposals for exploration and production in my neck of the woods&#x2014;Dunsfold, Alfold and Chiddingfold&#x2014;are all expected to be for gas. Only the Chiddingfold exploration borehole has been drilled so far and that has proved gas. The oil company promoting this work has gradually, in answer to much questioning, given information about what will be involved, which the company has learned from its seismological survey over a very big area.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00784">The gas deposit at Dunsfold runs across the middle of the village from east to west, in a cigar shape pattern about two miles long. I am informed that one of the favoured positions for the industrial site is about half a mile from the village church and half a mile from where I live, so my interest is a fairly close one. No doubt, other threatened villages have similar problems. So I have said enough, I think, to indicate
<col>176</col>
that the arrival of commercial gas abstraction in a village will drastically change the character of the village. Incidentally, to add insult to injury, the local community, which does not have a main gas supply now, will not even get a main gas supply after all this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00785">So I turn to the questions of national policy. It is clear that on-shore abstraction of gas raises serious environmental objections. It is also clear that experience in the United Kingdom is in its infancy, and I cannot believe that the technology of management could not be greatly improved. So I should like to ask these questions of my noble friend.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00786">First, at the present time, when North Sea oil and gas supply is in such abundant surplus that the price has had to be cut, despite the serious financial implications, is it really in the national interest to press on with development of all on-shore finds of oil and gas, irrespective of the environment? Secondly, would it not be better in the national interest, after proving the presence and capacity of an oil or gas deposit, to delay development to a time when the market is strong enough to absorb it?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00787">Thirdly, in view of the prospect of an industrial site, as I have described, of eight to 10 acres containing compressors and cleaning plant at every gas deposit which is to be developed, operating for 20 to 25 years, in the interests of conserving the environment of these attractive rural villages should not on-shore gas abstraction for production be postponed until the technique has been developed to pipe the gas away to a central processing plant sited in some suitable industrial estate, thus reducing the damage to the environment to the same dimensions as oil abstraction?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00788">I conclude by referring to the debate which is to take place next Monday on the 1984 Report of the Royal Commission. The burden of the report is to survey the progress which has been made in the past 10 years in reducing pollution in land, water and air and to examine what still remains to be done. All noble Lords will know that the story is that thousands of millions of pounds have been spent and immense efforts made to overcome the neglect of past generations and to repair the damage done. Today we are conscious of the continuing need to conserve the environment&#x2014;above all, to prevent fresh arrears accruing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00789">To permit these unspoilt rural areas of Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire to be defaced by a rash of oil and gas developments, especially gas, without ensuring adequate protection of the environment would be to do just that&#x2014;creating new pollution for our successors to clear up in the future. I am sure that this is not the intention of my noble friend, so I look forward to hearing what steps he can take to strengthen this offending circular to help local planning authorities protect our beautiful countryside.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00791"><member>Lord Campbell of Croy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend Lord Nugent of Guildford for having drawn attention to this recent draft circular and bringing to our notice in your Lordships'House the important matters with which it deals. I believe that they need to be widely understood and then handled with care by the authorities, both Government departments and local authorities.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0097"/>
<col>177</col>
The draft circular, coming from the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office, deals with England and Wales, and I should like to make a brief contribution, having myself been involved in one way and another in the discovery and production of off-shore oil since 1970. On-shore activities and installations were created by that, which produced similar problems but on a larger scale than those produced by on-shore drilling. I declare again an interest to the House in that I have spent the past nine years working in the oil industry with a company which is the operator of one of the largest fields in the North Sea.<lb/>
I should like to offer two propositions: first, there need not be conflict between the national need to realise our resources of oil and gas and the requirements of preserving the countryside and amenity; secondly, there is a danger that, because this is a new industry within Britain, unfounded alarm and distress can arise from fear of the unknown. On this second proposition, I am acutely aware, from my own experience in the early 1970s as Secretary of State for Scotland, of what can happen in the way of almost hysteria about the development of a new industry.<lb/>
The platform building sites on the seashore which were required are of massive proportions, as are the structures which they build. There are also other onshore installations, such as the terminal on Flotta in Scapa Flow. Those were all proposals which excited great concern and anxiety in Scotland and elsewhere. Of course, the environmental bodies immediately registered their worries. But the general public also, particularly in the areas of Scotland concerned, were naturally alarmed. They raised objections because they were unsure what was coming from this new industry, and what was needed quickly was the dissemination of clear and accurate information about what was in fact involved. I remind your Lordships that this was all to be done in areas of great natural beauty, mostly in the Highlands, in the Firths. The concern was not only about the areas, but also about the wildlife that might be threatened.<lb/>
I am glad to record that the fears of the responsible objectors were met, and in those cases it was consequently possible to avoid public inquiries which might have delayed North Sea oil production for up to two years. The Forties field, for example, the first very large field to be discovered, would have been delayed for about two years had there been a public inquiry, because two of the platform jackets were built at Nigg Bay. Her Majesty the Queen would not have been able to perform the inauguration ceremony for about two years after the date when she did so.<lb/>
It is fortuitous that my own home is in northern Scotland, the scene of this action. I have been known there for many years as one who is interested in protecting the environment and as one who has a knowledge of shore birds. They knew me first in that area as somebody who is an environmentalist and secondly as a Secretary of State who was concerned with the planning procedures. I suggest that this demonstrates a healthy sense of priorities. The message which I hope I can contribute to this debate is that these installations&#x2014;terminals, yards, associated
<col>178</col>
pipelines and other equipment on site&#x2014;have not since then given rise to any further serious objections, although they are situated in areas of outstanding natural beauty. Indeed, the reverse has been the case. There is universal concern in these areas when there are reports that these installations may not be needed in future years due to advances in technology and because of the facts of geography.<lb/>
Speaking therefore from the point of view of my personal interest in protecting the environment, coupled with some knowledge of the oil industry, may I make a few comments on the draft circular. In a large number of the cases which one can foresee, it should be possible for an oil company to accept the planning requirements for the site, though this may mean extra expense. The technology which is being developed in the North Sea offers various possibilities which could also be used onshore. I believe that the oil companies should go out of their way to comply with the requirements of good and sound planning.<lb/>
My next point is that the local authorities and the oil companies concerned should take the trouble to inform local communities about their plans. Perhaps this could be done at public meetings, as has been shore oil wells in operation which are so very well concealed or disguised that one would have no idea that they were connected with the industry. I am pleased to see that the nuisance of noise is mentioned several times in the circular. I believe it to be right that noise nuisance should be emphasised, particularly if it is a noise which continues throughout the night, as a result of which nearby communities would suffer.<lb/>
My next point is that the local authorities and the oil companies concerned should take the trouble to inform local communities about their plans. Perhaps this could be done at public meetings, as has been suggested in paragraph 14 of the draft circular. They could then dispel the rumours and exaggerated fears which can build up quickly. They could also learn of particular problems in the area and adapt their plans accordingly. This has been done on several occasions in different areas of Scotland, with very good results.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will consider with the greatest care the comments of my noble friend Lord Nugent of Guildford on additional provisions in the draft circular to improve the protection of local communities. I foresee the Government, local authorities and operating companies being able in this way to proceed with the confidence of those local communities.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00793"><member>Lord Teviot</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with some embarrassment I have to say that owing to a long-standing engagement I must crave the indulgence of your Lordships. I shall be unable to remain for the winding-up speeches and my noble friend's reply. This is the first occasion upon which I have had to leave before the end of a debate. I hope that it will be a long time before it ever happens again.<lb/>
Your Lordships may be aware that I asked a Question concerning the Government's policy on drilling for oil in areas of outstanding natural beauty&#x2014;in particular, Ditchling Beacon&#x2014;in November of last year. I am very pleased that my noble friend Lord
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0098"/>
<col>179</col>
Nugent of Guildford has seen fit to raise again more or less the same subject. I agree with him about the additional hazard of gas. However, the essence of my argument in November of last year was that areas of outstanding natural beauty are, first, as much a part of the nation's natural resources as are oil and gas and, secondly, that governments of all complexions have recognised this by designating them. Furthermore, a fixed and finite amount of beautiful landscape, peace and solitude are available in this crowded island, whereas oil and gas reserves, if not infinite, at least are currently in surplus and, unlike landscape, are ultimately replaceable by alternative energy resources.<lb/>
Again one must say that the Government have abrogated their responsibility, particularly with respect to areas of outstanding natural beauty, by leaving planning decisions relating to oil and gas exploration and production in the hands of local authorities which, for a variety of reasons, are not the best people to handle them. Furthermore, having left the planning decisions to local authorities, the Government have not provided them with either the means or the policies by which to make sound judgments as to the relative merits of the case for oil and gas against landscape and social amenity. I said also&#x2014;this is a particularly important point&#x2014;that it was evident that local authorities were catching up with the flood of applications too late and are only now developing their policies.<lb/>
My noble friend's objections to gas exploration at Dunsfold are similar to the objections raised by the residents of Ditchling. Dunsfold is not in an area of outstanding natural beauty. Nevertheless, it is just as pleasant an area, though the AONB label is not attached to it. The Government were prepared to let the normal planning process take its course when responding to my Question in November 1983, so why should they take any more notice now? The answer is that since November 1983 there has been substantial experience of the effects of on-shore oil and gas exploration upon local communities and landscapes. There is also evidence of how seemingly innocuous applications for single exploratory wells and well sites can grow like Topsy, once commercial interests have taken control.<lb/>
May I give to your Lordships two examples. The first is Graffham in West Sussex. As a result of their direct experience of oil exploration at Graffham, West Sussex County Council have tightened up their planning policies. There are indications that they wish they had never started, but it is now too late. My second example is Humbly Grove in Hampshire. No fewer than 70 wells on the Humbly Grove site have been sunk&#x2014;far in excess of anything which was envisaged at the time of the original exploration application. As a result, a local residents committee has been formed to fight it, but again it is too late. The Government have at last produced some guidelines for local authorities. These are too late. I reiterate also that I believe such decisions should be taken out of the hands of local authorities.<lb/>
That said, what can one say about the draft proposals? In my view, three points can be made. First, the Government appear to lack the courage of their own convictions. There are occasions when their
<col>180</col>
proposed actions do not match the merits of their own arguments. Secondly, there are still many areas where important policies and operating procedures remain to be developed. Thirdly, there are some potentially misleading statements. Let me give to your Lordships a few examples.<lb/>
The draft proposal acknowledges that there is currently a surplus of oil and gas from the North Sea. It also states that new fields are even now being developed off shore, particularly in estuaries and in relatively shallow water off the coastline. If that is the case, what is the importance and urgency of developing on-shore fields? We already have a surplus; and oil and gas developments in shallow water are far cheaper than in deep water. So economically, and in future energy supplies, the Government's requirements are being met without recourse to on-shore wells.<lb/>
Section 9 of the draft acknowledges proposed developments in specially designated areas of the landscape, and it specifically mentions that AONBs should be subject to the same "rigorous examination" as national parks are currently accorded. That is from Department of the Environment Circular 4/76. Yet nowhere in the text of these draft proposals are local authorities told how to apply "rigorous examination". No special provision whatever is made. Indeed, Section 11 states that the Government believed that,
<quote>"The provisions operative for all minerals [a decade ago] provided a sufficiently comprehensive and distinctive framework of control to meet the Committee's concern, and this remains the position".</quote>
Section 24 of the draft states that
<quote>"The new edition of the Memorandum on the Control of Minerals Working (the Green Paper) will cover in general terms all those detailed environmental factors which mineral planning authorities should have regard to in deciding mineral applications".</quote>
Once again we are talking of the future tense. Is it not time that applications were considered under properly considered and fully developed policies?<lb/>
In summary, I believe that these draft proposals are too little and too late to have any real impact. I urge the Government to take closer control over on-shore development and, to use their own phrase, to be more "rigorous" in their examination of all the issues involved. I wish my noble friend great success in his opposition to gas developments on his doorstep. Furthermore, having read the report put up by the local protection association&#x2014;an excellent document&#x2014;I will refer to one particular road. It is the A.281 which runs between Horsham and Guildford. It is one of the most unpleasant of roads to drive along. It is very dangerous and if Surrey County Council goes ahead, I suggest that they dare not do so until the M.25 is finished. The A.281 is a very dangerous road now and it will be made very much worse by the proposed development.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00795"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we had in the last sentence of the speech made by my noble friend Lord Teviot a perfect example of the quandary we all face. He complained, justifiably, about the state of the A281, which I, too, drive down. The answer would be to straighten it, widen it and make it into a dual carriageway&#x2014;whereupon the same noble Lords would all be on their feet complaining about the horrendous
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0099"/>
<col>181</col>
damage being done to the environment. We have to be extremely careful. When we take objection to any form of development or progress, we have to be very careful that we do not fall into that very easy trap.<lb/>
As a fellow Surrey Peer I am delighted that my noble friend Lord Nugent of Guildford has raised this matter in your Lordships' House today. I will try to confine my remarks to the Surrey development plans. Of course we need energy, and certainly gas is one of the cheapest and most efficient forms of energy we have. The creation of jobs and employment is an important objective for good and sensible government&#x2014;but so is the preservation and protection of the qualities of a civilised and beautiful countryside a prerequisite of sensitive Ministers.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Nugent has pointed to the lack of sufficient emphasis on environmental factors in this particular circular as well as the failure to differentiate between the undoubted dissimilarities between oil wells and gas processing plants. I should like to add what little emphasis I can to the criticism of that lack of emphasis.<lb/>
Paragraph 21 of the circular says it is essential to screen or landscape sites. But a later paragraph shows that an oil site on land is one of the longest surviving of these particular sites, and should last for about 25 years. An oak tree barely reaches shoulder height in 25 years, so it means that we have either to build earth banks or bury the site, or use those enormous friends of every single garden centre owner&#x2014;and here I declare an interest as one of them&#x2014;the Leylandii cypress. I see that my noble friend on the Front Bench also has some experience of these factors and knows about the Leylandii. They offer an instant screen in the area where I live.<lb/>
This brings me straight on to the prospective drilling for gas by Conoco in the area where my noble friend Lord Nugent lives. Perhaps one would be slightly more sympathetic to Conoco if this development was going to turn my noble friend into an instant J. R. Ewing; but the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934 nationalised (as always by a Conservative Government) the oil rights, and it thus effectively denies my noble friend his stetson.<lb/>
The part of the south Surrey/Hampshire/Sussex border where all this is due to take place is an exceptionally attractive area in a very English way. It is the countryside of Cobbett. It is a close countryside full of oak trees; and the hedges still continue their old pattern, produced by early enclosure. The contrast with the much larger and more open Scottish countryside is very marked. I drove to the north of Scotland the other day. One saw the oil rigs being built on Nigg Bay, and in a funny way they are very beautiful, because they are so far away. They are not close in. I said to my wife, with whom I was driving to Scotland, "In a funny way they remind me of Chartres Cathedral, in that they come straight out of the surrounding countryside". That is a very subjective judgment, but one thing of which I am absolutely certain is that an eight to 10-acre concrete gas processing site can never produce that kind of reaction in the Surrey countryside or in a close English countryside. It is a difference of perception between different countrysides.<lb/>
<col>182</col>
If one travels on the M6 on the way to Scotland, just south of Carlisle the road cuts through and there is an enormous contrast between great banks of hills on one side and the road going through the middle. There is something essentially beautiful about that. That beauty is totally absent on the M25, cutting through the close English countryside. I am totally prepared to accept that what I am saying is totally subjective and probably personal to me only. There may be people who think that the M25 cutting through close English countryside is much more beautiful than the M6 cutting through big, open countryside. On the whole, I believe that more people tend to agree with me.<lb/>
The countryside where my noble friend lives really has got to be protected from the pressures. Of course, that protection must not be an absolute dead hand on any development. Succumbing to the threat that this development produces for a maximum find of gas for six months for the use of the South Eastern Gas Board&#x2014;and, as my noble friend said, the threat is to villages that do not even have gas&#x2014;is not worth the damage that it is going to cause. I hope it will be looked at in enormous detail and with even greater compassion and care.<lb/>
Rightly, the agriculture industry is being criticised for some of its more insensitive environmental habits. The gas industry can cause much more damage than farmers, so it must take heed of the warning. Above all, I hope that the county councils of Surrey, Hampshire and Sussex, who are obviously in the forefront of our minds, will be Bismarckian in their iron determination not to allow any drilling or production development without the strictest of all conditions being imposed. All I am asking is that enormous care and even greater concern are shown by those in authority. If it is not, they will have committed an outrage on an area of especially subtle and gentle perspective which is a beautiful and natural part of our inheritance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00797"><member>Viscount Torrington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Nugent of Guildford, for bringing this interesting document to the attention of this House. As usual, before I continue I must declare an interest in this subject. While I have no connection with the company which has applied to drill at Dunsfold, I am attached to a company which is involved in precisely the same kind of business. I live in Hampshire, where there is a lot of this sort of activity, but I have to say to your Lordships that most of my company's activities are in Scotland, although shortly to move south.<lb/>
Having declared that interest, I suppose that if I were to say that it is a good and balanced paper it would be to condemn it out of hand. I certainly have to agree with earlier speakers that the paper does not address the subject of gas development in the detail which it perhaps ought to do. However, my noble friend Lord Nugent lives at Dunsfold, where these sort of developments are not welcome. I have seen two areas in Scotland where planning applications have been made for drilling, one of them not so far from one of those rig-building yards, admittedly, but another in a fairly attractive part of Fife, where both the local authorities and indeed the local people have been very
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0100"/>
<col>183</col>
glad to see this sort of development happen. I am sad to say that the wells concerned resulted in dry holes and there has been no further development to please the locals.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Nugent brings a great deal of experience to this topic, in that he served in the past in the Ministry of Agriculture and later on the London and South-East Regional Planning Council. Perhaps after the debate he can explain to me why there seems to be a system of planning for agricultural matters which is totally different from that for, for example, oil and gas. The valley which runs past my village in Hampshire has recently been disfigured by the erection of an agricultural feed mill in the name of an agricultural building. In fact, it is hardly an agricultural process. It is the most insensitive development I have ever seen. I think I can honestly assure the House that the oil industry would never contemplate onshore in the south of England or in any other part of the United Kingdom, anything like so insensitive a development.<lb/>
In this paper the phrase "good oilfield practice" is mentioned. This is perhaps an industry term of art. In the old days it meant using the right steel pipe, the right pieces of gadgetry and the right weight of mud while drilling a hole. However, in recent years this has come to mean a great deal more and, in the context of exploration on-shore in the United Kingdom, good oilfield practice has one chapter on the technical side and several chapters on the preservation and care of the environment. The oil industry is only too aware that it has to live, not by public acceptability, perhaps, so much as by public forbearance, because, as an earlier speaker mentioned, there are no financial benefits to the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, from the fact that he may live within the drainage area of an oil or gas well.<lb/>
I know little about the development by Conoco at Dunsfold, but no one seems to have mentioned the fact that the well concerned is to be drilled on an airfield which is in active use. I am surprised that it causes so many ruffled feathers. It seems to me that it is an activity which is&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00798"><member>The Earl of Onslow</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not sure whether I am in order but perhaps I may be allowed to help the noble Viscount on this point. That airfield is not like other airfields. In fact it is extremely sensitively done and is surrounded by trees. In itself it is a very nice piece of countryside. That is the point. It is not like London Airport or Gatwick.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00799"><member>Viscount Torrington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Onslow for that. Nevertheless, it is an airfield.<lb/>
I should also like to point out that, as I understand it, we are talking of a possible deposit at Dunsfold of some seven kilometres by three kilometres. That is the technical people's view of the possible size of the field. I should like to point out that if this was an oilfield it might require about 100 wells to develop it. Due to the fact that it is gas&#x2014;and I understand the reservoir is fairly permeable&#x2014;the whole field may be developed with as few as two or three wells. Therefore, from the point of view of disruption from drilling there is not too much to fear. The actual surface facility left at the<lb/>
<col>184</col>
wellside afterwards will amount to something a little bigger than a pillar-box. There are regulations which require it to be fenced within a certain distance but intrinsically it should be very inconspicuous. Certainly, in the context of a producing well on the airfield, one would not know that it was not a hydrant for aviation fuel.<lb/>
I agree that the gathering system is a greater problem. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, was quite correct. He seemed to imply&#x2014;and no doubt he will forgive me if I misheard him&#x2014;that there was to be more than one gathering system. He said, I think, that there would be one for each well site. I do not think that that would be the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00800"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I help my noble friend? I said one for each find or deposit. One for the whole deposit. I also described, for the information of my noble friend, the dimensions of the gas deposit, as forecast now by the company, as stretching some two miles from east to west across the centre of the village. The proposal to drill a well on the extreme end of it on the airfield, therefore, does not describe the effect it would have on the village itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00801"><member>Viscount Torrington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate that. Until at least one more well is drilled no one has any idea of how big this field will be and whether ultimately it will be an economic field.<lb/>
It is obviously necessary to have a balance between the environment, the potential for employment and the needs of the oil industry. I was interested to see that a number of objections to the development at Dunsfold queried whether gas development was really necessary. The sort of field which might be there could in fact contain, at import replacement values, some &#x00A3;100 million to &#x00A3;200 million-worth of gas. When we are about to buy Sleipner gas from Norway very expensively, that is obviously quite important. If cumulatively we developed a number of fields through southern England, that could do quite a major job in replacing those proposed imports, and, personally, I should rather overlook a sensitive oil development than the operations of an insensitive farmer.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00803"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, for giving us the opportuniity once again to discuss this subject. Some of us remember the debate last November in which we all took part. I sympathise very much with the noble Lord in his local difficulty, but I apologise; I do not know the area and therefore cannot comment on the likely effects on it.<lb/>
It seemed to me that the circular indicated that a better system was being sought. I know that there are faults in it, but it is a consultative document and one hopes that during the consultations improvements will be made. After all, discussion of whether something is beautiful is very subjective. If one lives in an area that has been without electricity for a long time, the sight of a line of electric pylons marching towards you can be very beautiful indeed. If one is out of work and the local community is depressed, the prospect of employment from a local industry can, again, be a very attractive thought.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0101"/>
<col>185</col>
I have one or two little comments that I should like to make on the beginning of the circular. At the end of page 1 it says:
<quote>"This Circular is not considered to have significant expenditure and manpower implications for mineral planning authorities".</quote>
I should like to remind the Minister that during the time of the discussion last year the Association of County Councils was very worried because it was said that the amount allowed in the planning regulations to deal with planning applications for these oil developments was nothing like enough to cover the cost of the officers' time. I wonder whether anything has been done about that. When one considers the profit in a successful oil strike, the fact that ratepayers may have to subsidise the cost of the planning application is not acceptable. Perhaps I may be told about that at the end of the debate.<lb/>
I am also concerned, as is the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, that the Secretary of State for Energy still appears to have sole responsibility for the issue of licences. It seems to me that there should at least be discussion with the Department of the Environment at a very early stage before any licences are issued.<lb/>
However, the fact that licences for the three major stages&#x2014;exploration, appraisal and development&#x2014;now require planning permission is an improvement on the old system, although I wonder whether the vibroseis stage should not also require planning permission. Once the initial seismic exploration has revealed the possibility of an oil or gas deposit, the pressures will be very great to go on from there. The pressures on the local authority to refuse if it is told that it is in the national interest are very great indeed. Therefore, I wonder whether planning permission should be required at the very beginning or whether there should be much wider consultation at the stage when the initial vibroseis exploration shows possibilities.<lb/>
Also I believe&#x2014;and this was something, again, that we discussed last year&#x2014;that there should be no-go areas. The best safeguard of all, of course, is to establish consistent standards of planning control throughout the country. I do not agree with the noble Earl that local authorities are not capable of implementing the planning requirements, but there must be a consistent standard. I think at the moment it varies very much from authority to authority. I shall return to that in a moment.<lb/>
There is a temptation to give special consideration to national parks and areas of natural beauty. Every environment is important to the people who live in it. That is another reason why I feel that standards should be uniform Every resident of every area where exploration is likely to occur is entitled to have good standards of control and reinstatement. The control of air pollution, noise and traffic have all been mentioned. They are just as essential whether or not the village or town is labelled an area of natural beauty.<lb/>
We understand the need to establish the existence of national resources. There are just a few areas in which exploration should never be permitted at all. I refer particularly to SSSIs and some nature reserves, where restoration would be impossible. Some SSSIs&#x2014;the
<col>186</col>
Minister seems to be in difficulty: SSSI stands for site of special scientific interest. Some of them date from the ice age. To disturb them for any purpose whatsoever is unthinkable. They are our heritage from long ago. They cannot be restored and must not be disturbed. It is our duty to maintain them and hand them on to the next generation. I think that from them all threats should be removed.<lb/>
The East Sussex County Council, whose wish to amend its structure plan was discussed in detail last year&#x2014;which I criticised rather heavily at the time&#x2014;has, after wide consultation and after listening to the debate in this House, come up with a very acceptable document. I commend it to your Lordships. I believe that it is before the Minister at the moment. It has not yet been approved by him. It has within it all the difficulties which are explored in the document, and I think that it gives very good protection to all the aspects. It is a long document and I do not propose to read all of it to your Lordships. I should like to mention just one or two of the things that it says:
<quote>"The County Council supports in principle exploration for oil and gas. It supports production of oil and gas insofar as it is in the national interest but this does not imply any precedence over the countryside and conservation policies in this plan. Development will not be permitted which"&#x2014;</quote>
and it lists a number of instances; I will not go into them all because they are not all applicable everywhere&#x2014;
<quote>"is inconsistent with the objectives of an area of outstanding natural beauty or a conservation area &#x2026; would damage an ancient monument &#x2026; would prejudice the reasons for which a site of special scientific interest was notified or for which any nature reserve was declared".</quote>
If that became an accepted practice throughout the country, I think that it would meet most of the objections raised by most of the conservationists and environmentalists who at the moment are so worried about these possible developments. As I say, the document goes on at great length but I shall not weary your Lordships with it. I recommend those who are involved in such worry to read it and press the Minister to make this a national standard.<lb/>
To come back to the original discussions that we had, as I understand it, the drilling rig, which is so high and which cannot be screened, is normally a very short-term development. When it goes, it is replaced by a "Christmas tree", which is like a glorified water hydrant. It is a bit larger but not much. It can easily be disguised. I think perhaps it is unreasonable not to say that that would be acceptable, given that there are proper consultations with the local authorities and that it is properly disguised when eventually it is put into use.<lb/>
I cannot speak about gas development. I do not really know enough about what is involved in the end. But I know that all the time new technology is occurring which will reduce the impact of all these developments on the countryside. Provided proper consultation is undertaken, the local authorities keep up to date and the oil companies are made to keep up to date in their application of the new technology, it is perfectly possible for developments to be made which will not have too much impact on the surrounding area.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0102"/>
<col>187</col>
But we have to ask ourselves the last question of all. It is this. We should be seeking to conserve for future generations not only the environment but our resources. Are we making proper use of the resources that we have? Are we making proper attempts at the conservation of our resources? Do we really need to go ahead with many of the explorations that we are doing? If the answer to that last question is, yes, then we must accept it, but I really wonder whether the first two questions have been properly explored.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00805"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I welcome the debate initiated this evening by my noble friend Lord Nugent of Guildford. Oil and gas on shore is a most topical subject and my recent spell away from Environment at the Department of Energy has certainly given me an added insight into the subjects. I am therefore grateful to my noble friend for asking this Question and, indeed, to other noble Lords, whose contributions have been both balanced and constructive. My noble friend asked specifically about the Government's intentions as to the draft circular produced by the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office. I can, of course, assure him that they are wholly honourable. I can also respond in the knowledge that this is the most straightforward question to answer of the many asked this evening.<lb/>
The draft circular on <i>Planning Control over Oil and Gas Operations</i> is at present out for consultation with interested parties. We have asked for comments by the end of this month. We shall then consider all the representations that we have received together with the views expressed in discussions with the local authority associations, the industry and others. We intend to publish a final version by the end of the year. I have no doubt that this consultation period will prove most valuable.<lb/>
Interest in the draft circular has been considerable. So far we have had an encouraging response. Some comments have been kinder, like those of the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, some not so kind like those of my noble friend Lord Teviot. I should perhaps correct something that I think my noble friend Lord Teviot said about the Hampshire County Council. I do not believe that they were surprised by the expansion of oil development. The planning application for which approval was given in August included seeking approval for 65 wells, and this was closely examined by the planning authority before permission was granted. The existing exploration wells were given planning permission several years ago.<lb/>
Many of the points raised so far in the consultation&#x2014;I stress that we still await the views of a number of important interests&#x2014;have been touched upon this evening. I shall seek to respond to these. But we have some way to go before we are in a position to assess what exact changes are needed in order to secure the correct balance between the need to satisfy our energy requirements and our wish to protect the environment. My noble friend Lord Onslow touched on this subject. I can assure the House that all the comments that we receive&#x2014;and I should like to stress in particular those made this evening&#x2014;will be considered most carefully. We intend to get the
<col>188</col>
balance right and to produce a document that will command as wide a range of support as possible.<lb/>
There are conflicting views and, indeed, we have heard them tonight. But I have no doubt that some considerable measure of agreement can be reached. I might mention to my noble friend Lord Onslow that I am told that Kimmeridge, for instance, which has been going for 20 years now, is very well screened and quite attractively landscaped. I understand equally that Wytch Farm is in an area surrounded by trees. The draft circular aims to provide guidance to mineral planning authorities on the exercise of their powers over on-shore oil and gas development. In particular it indicates the national policy considerations that need to be taken into account, the respective roles of licensing and planning systems in regulating and controlling such development, and some of the particular factors that need to be considered when determining individual planning applications. It also explains just what is involved in the exploration, appraisal and production stages of oil and gas development, although it is not designed to provide a fully exhaustive account of this technical subject.<lb/>
The first question that I should like to answer is, why do we need to go for oil and gas on shore at all when we are so blessed with our North Sea reserves and when there is a worldwide oil glut? There is no one response. I should like to put it this way. We are not concerned just for the present. We need to look ahead against the prospect of uncertain world energy supplies. Oil and gas are both extractive industries, and supplies are inevitably depleted over time. I should perhaps mention that even today we import 25 per cent. of our gas needs. It is not clear how long production from the North Sea can be maintained at present levels. That depends on very many factors. But it is the Government's intention to maintain a large share of domestic production into the next century. To achieve this, we need to maintain a high level of exploration activity. I believe that the Government have a clear duty to establish the extent of our oil and gas reserves and to ensure that this is done in an environmentally acceptable manner.<lb/>
Our policy is also to ensure that proven resources are developed economically and expeditiously consistent with good oilfield practice and the protection of the environment. In this way, we can look forward to a responsible and creative contribution. Particular supply investments in oil and gas on shore as in other energy sectors are for the industry itself to justify in the first instance against commercial criteria. But, on-shore as well as off-shore, companies must first obtain a licence from my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy. The licensing system is first and foremost designed to achieve a satisfactory balance of safeguards and rights between the Government in whom the resources are vested and the licensee. It is also designed to provide a framework for the orderly development of the resource itself, so that fields are exploited safely and responsibly and individual drilling proposals are rigorously scrutinised. So I hope that the House will agree that it is hardly a free-for-all.<lb/>
Nor is there the implication that exploitation will inevitably follow the finding of commercial quantities
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0103"/>
<col>189</col>
of oil or gas. Possession of a licence confers no right of entry onto the land nor does it confer planning permission on any proposed development. A licence always requires planning permission before the deep drilling of exploration and appraisal boreholes can be undertaken. And the Department of Energy requires evidence that the necessary planning permission has been obtained before authorising development wells and production facilities. In addition, under the new licensing arrangements to be introduced early next year, production licences will not be awarded unless and until a company has obtained planning permission.<lb/>
I make no apology for emphasising these controls. I do so because they indicate our concern that development of our on-shore oil and gas reserves should go ahead only under the most stringent conditions. These apply whether or not the proposals relate to development in the most sensitive environmental areas and we shall continue to strengthen them whenever we consider it necessary to do so. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, that the expression "sites of special scientific interest" is absolutely emblazoned on my heart after taking something called the Wildlife and Countryside Act through this House. We cannot but be aware that interest in on-shore oil and gas tends to lead companies to areas where there is strong national interest in preserving the landscape and in protecting particular environments and communities. However, it is an uncomfortable fact&#x2014;and it has been said many times before&#x2014;that the geology that harbours our oil and gas reserves is also responsible for the special landscape features and habitats that prompted their designation as areas of outstanding natural beauty or sites of special scientific interest.<lb/>
Of course, special policy considerations apply to all development proposals in such areas and to those areas where oil and gas lie beneath high quality agricultural land. My right honourable friend and his predecessors have made very clear that we expect any such proposals to be subjected to the most rigorous examination as to their effect on the environment. I am more than happy to repeat that assurance tonight. There is no way in which oil and gas development can be permitted to proceed unless proposals are environmentally acceptable. The industry knows this and the local authorities know it. However, we have to face the fact&#x2014;and my noble friend Lord Nugent has brought that out tonight&#x2014;that, for example, in southern England, over 20 per cent. of the land area is protected in some way or another, and a large proportion of the remainder is either already developed or highly valued by farmers and other members of the community. There can be few areas where so rich a heritage of national environment occurs side by side with so well informed and knowledgeable a sector of the population. May I tell the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, that I have frequently driven through his village of Dunsfold, and next time I hope that I may stop and visit him. But, of course, that will have to wait until any application has been prejudged.<lb/>
In these circumstances I believe it makes no sense at all to look for no-go areas. We have to find ways of reconciling these sometimes conflicting interests, each wholly legitimate in its own terms. Part of the search
<col>190</col>
for acceptable solutions means facing up to the fact that the more we know about the structure and location of oil and gas reserves in an area the more options are available from which to choose an acceptable pattern of development. This applies as much to areas where oil or gas bearing structures lie off-shore as it does on-shore, and this is why our draft circular gives explicit encouragement to exploration and appraisal, subject to the effects on the environment being assessed fully. Without this knowledge we do not know what we have and what options are open to us should we wish to exploit it.<lb/>
A second strand in our search for acceptable ways of reconciling energy and environmental interests is to recognise that such choices are best made by those elected by the communities most affected. The Government are firmly of the view that planning decisions on on-shore oil and gas should rest as far as possible with the mineral planning authorities. It is demonstrably the case that local authorities are best suited to draw up sensible policies for such development following full consultation with the local people, and I pay tribute to those members and officers in local authorities who have done so to date.<lb/>
Of course some applications, most particularly the larger ones, present difficult choices, and the policies which my right honourable friend approves in structure plans have to be designed to meet these cases as well as the less controversial ones. Our circular, when published, will give further guidance on the factors to consider in handling specific proposals. It is only in exceptional circumstances that my right honourable friend will wish to call in an application for his own decision.<lb/>
The guidance in the circular will aim to be as positive as possible. It cannot, however, anticipate each and every case. Circumstances will vary markedly between different sites and proposals, and what is acceptable in one part of an authority's area may perhaps be rejected by that authority elsewhere. We shall look for consistency in the way proposals are considered and acted upon.<lb/>
My noble friend expressed particular concern about the effects on the environment of gas exploration and development as distinct from those of oil. I should like, if I may, to turn to this question for a minute. A gas development is not necessarily larger or more obtrusive than oil. The size of the site depends to a degree on the size of the field and on other factors such as whether unwanted compounds like hydrogen sulphide need to be removed, and what other treatment is needed. This holds true for both gas and oil. I understand that if gas is confirmed at Dunsfold&#x2014;I underline "if because there is uncertainty in exploration&#x2014;the likely size of the site required would be somewhere around five to eight acres. Should hydrogen sulphide be present, I am told that it can be removed by a through, smell-free process and that the noise level would be minimal. It could even be inaudible from outside the site. My noble friend has produced his idea on gas to me fairly recently and I should like to continue to pursue it and let him know any further information which I might find.</membercontribution></p>

<col>191</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00806"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend leaves that point, will he deal with my question about the possibility of improving technology so that gas can be piped, as is oil, to an arterial point where it can be treated on an industrial site centrally, rather than <i>in situ</i> in the rural area where it is so objectionable?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00807"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I will indeed pursue this subject generally with my noble friend. Later on in my notes I have something about technology.<lb/>
I believe that we neglect at our peril the important fund of expertise and advice available in those who live and work locally and who are most immediately affected by any proposals. Our planning system is designed to use constructively such skills and advice. I would say to the noble Baroness, Lady Nicol, who asked a question on planning fees, that these have been reviewed from time to time but no specific adjustment has been made to deal with oil and gas. It would, I believe, be difficult to produce such a refined set of fees, if I can put it that way, to reflect exactly the amount of work involved.<lb/>
I should like to say, although my noble friend Lord Torrington has spent some time on the subject, that I, too, have been impressed by the awareness for the environment of those concerned with the exploration for gas and oil. I believe they really do care, and have been persuaded to care, for the environment, and I believe also that we should pay tribute to their willingness to return the countryside and keep the countryside in its beautiful state.<lb/>
I should like to make two further points about on-shore oil and gas. Because it is an extractive industry, even the largest oil and gas fields will be depleted in due course. Production will cease and restoration of the site can begin. Mineral planning authorities do have the powers to impose proper restoration and after-care conditions on such development, both in relation to well sites and to the larger gathering and handling facilities, and we expect these to be used imaginatively.<lb/>
Secondly, I know that some noble Lords and others outside are worried about the possible proliferation of surface development facilities. This is not uncommon in the North Sea. In these circumstances the Government have the powers to ensure that the exploitation of such fields is carried out as one, and we shall use these powers if it proves necessary to do so.<lb/>
I have welcomed the opportunity, so early after my return to the Department of the Environment, afforded by my noble friend's Question, first to listen to your Lordships' views and then to respond to them by explaining the thinking behind our advice in the draft circular. One of the benefits of issuing advice in draft form for consultation is that those who have a point can express it before we go to the printers and commit our thoughts to posterity. I can assure your Lordships that I and my department will consider very carefully all the points that have been put tonight. I am most grateful to my noble friends and other noble Lords for what has been a most interesting debate.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Sunday Observance: Licensing Legislation</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00823"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00824">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00825">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in view of the fact that rigid licensing restrictions forced the cancellation of a charity ball in Suffolk arranged for Saturday 21st July, which had been expected to raise a substantial sum of money for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, they will forthwith introduce legislation to liberalise or repeal the licensing laws and the Sunday observance laws.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00826"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the difficulty in this case was that the proposed function was thought likely by the justices to run foul of the restrictions on public dancing in the Sunday Observance Act 1780. The view taken by successive Governments on proposals to amend this Act has been that this is a matter more suitable for Private Members' than for Government legislation. We therefore have no plans of our own for legislation in this field. As regards the law on liquor licensing, there is no immediate prospect of legislation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00827"><member>Lord Monson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that reply. Whatever the precise facts&#x2014;and my information is that the organisers of the event did comply with all the correct procedures&#x2014;may I put to the noble Baroness two questions arising from this unfortunate affair? Is it not time that the licensing laws in England and Wales were brought into line with the more liberal licensing laws which apply in Scotland and which have caused no difficulty over the last seven years or so? Secondly, is it not time that the Government plucked up their courage and decided to stand up to the Lord's Day Observance Society, which represents no more than one-tenth of 1 per cent. of the population?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00828"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have said, successive Governments have taken the view that legislation relating to Sundays is a matter affecting the conscience of individual Members and is therefore more suitable for Private Members' than for Government legislation. With regard to Scotland, certain relaxations have been made, as the noble Lord indicated. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has announced that a survey is to be undertaken on the workings of the Scottish legislation. We shall want to see the results of that survey and
<col>196</col>
evaluate carefully the effects of extended opening hours in Scotland before deciding whether similar relaxation should be introduced in England and Wales. Actually, these changes would not have affected the particular ball to which the Question refers.<lb/>
In reply to the second part of the noble Lord's question, I would say that really it is a question of balance. It is quite true that many people believe that our opening hours are too restrictive, and we receive many representations in favour of greater flexibility of hours from those involved in the catering, leisure, tourist and licensed trades. On the other hand, there are those deeply concerned about the problems of alcohol misuse who are worried about the possibility that longer permitted hours may lead to an increase in alcohol consumption. The Government clearly have to take both arguments into consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00829"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not a fact that investigations all over the world, and over many years, have shown that the more restricted the licensing hours the more drunkenness in fact occurs?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00830"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, personally speaking (even though I should take the view of the Government) I do not know the answer to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00831"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that the noble Lord who has just spoken could not produce any evidence whatsoever in support of his statement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00832"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is still a matter for a Private Member's Bill, and not a Government one.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00834"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I have already said, when one speaks from this particular position one speaks on behalf of the Government and not from a personal point of view.</membercontribution></p>

That money would have been better used for investment into our manufacturing base to retain jobs rather than being distributed, not needlessly but in a way that was no use whatsoever in an objective sense in the creation of jobs, in unemployment and related social benefit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00842"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would not draw the conclusion that the noble Lord has drawn from my Answer. The Government want to see an efficient and competitive manufacturing sector, and I believe that we are going a long way towards achieving that end. The fact of the matter is that manufacturing output is now rising whereas it fell between 1974 and 1979. The noble Lord mentioned investment. Investment in manufacturing rose by 9.5 per cent. in the first half of this year and was up 15 per cent. on the previous year. The difficulty about the figures is that there is of course a long-term trend towards services, which is to be found in many countries and that trend we have also made use of in the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00843"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret coming back to the Dispatch Box so soon; but I think that it is accepted that in the search for more jobs the service sector will have to take a larger percentage of people into employment in order to have some effect on the dole queue. However, the main area for provision will once again be the manufacturing sector. The Minister would do well to look at the figures and say whether the Government have any ideas when they will increase the 9 per cent. investment into a more realistic figure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00844"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all I would say is that investment in manufacturing is increasing. I believe that if we stick to our guns it will continue to do so.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00845"><member>Lord Gisborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend say whether or not productivity has risen during that period? Secondly, what is the position as regards vacancies?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00846"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said in my original Answer, productivity has risen very considerably. I am glad that my noble friend has asked me about vacancies because it really does not seem very much
<col>198</col>
good our being worried, as we all are, about the level of unemployment if vacancies are not taken up. The fact of the matter is that vacancies in September were at their highest level for four and a half years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00847"><member>Lord Kaldor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as compared with the peak reached in the first quarter of 1979, manufacturing output is still down about 13 to 15 per cent. and manufacturing investment&#x2014;despite the 9 per cent. rise that has been mentioned, I believe, for the past year&#x2014;is still more than 40 per cent. lower than it was before the present Government came in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00848"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to look at those figures; I do not know that I agree with the noble Lord, but I do not have figures today to rebut them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00849"><member>Lord Rochester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not inevitable that, in order to remain internationally competitive and to do this by continuing to improve productivity, there will continue for some time to come to be a decline in employment in manufacturing industry, particularly in large-scale organisations? But does not this accentuate the need to focus attention increasingly on measures designed to increase employment in such diverse units as co-operatives, enterprise trusts, community businesses and science parks?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00850"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that the Government would disagree in the very least with what the noble Lord, Lord Rochester, has said, speaking as I know he does from long experience of these matters. However, let me add two other points. First, as the noble Lord will well know, there are certain sectors of manufacturing which are successful at the present time and which are showing encouraging increases in employment. Secondly, surely we also need to train for the future; and of course that is what the Manpower Services Commission is all about and that is what the debate in your Lordships' House two nights ago was all about.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00851"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the noble Lord agree that this is merely part of a very long-term trend and that the same thing has happened in agriculture over more than a century? Originally agriculture was the occupation of the great majority of the people of this country, but it is now the occupation of only a very small percentage. Is it not true that the same is clearly happening in the industrial sector and that it is probably irreversible? Moreover, is it not true that the only people who fail to recognise this are the dinosaurs on the Labour Party Benches?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00852"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Viscount that the trend in the reduction in employment in manufacturing is something which has been going on since the 1960s. If I may just refer to what the noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, said just now, the fact of the matter is that, despite that long-term trend in employment, we have today a situation where productivity is up, investment is up, employment in services is up, vacancies are up and the total numbers in employment compared with last year are up. I think that that is a reasonable outlook for the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00853"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the risk of being classified as one of the dinosaurs, may I ask the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0108"/>
<col>199</col>
Minister to confirm that, even in industries such as textiles where the trend downwards has been going on for a long time, there has been an increase in trade at the upper end of the industry where they are trading up market and have adjusted to new types of demand?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00854"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that that is true. I should like to confirm that that is so, and if in any way it is wrong I shall write immediately to the noble Baroness, but I believe that what she says is indeed true.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00855"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord said that there were the increases in percentages; would he not agree that in each of those cases the reason why he can give an increase in the percentage is that he is talking now about such a low base compared with 1979? Secondly, the noble Lord says that there are many vacancies in manufacturing industry that are not being taken up. Would he be kind enough to tell us to which industries he is referring?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00856"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely right; I invariably find myself in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Beswick. It is indeed the case that we start off from a low base in so many things because when the present Government came into office we had just passed through one of the most ghastly winters that this country can ever remember which was presided over in the dying months of the Labour Government of that time. Therefore, the noble Lord is absolutely right on that point. So far as the increase in employment in certain sections of manufacturing is concerned, if the noble Lord would care to glance some time at the electrical and electrical engineering industries, metal goods of various kinds, instrument engineering, industrial plant and steel work and processing of plastics, he will find that there has been an increase in employment in those various occupations bordering on 30,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00857"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the horrendous figures which he has been kind enough to give in his Answer to the first part of the Question are, in the main, a reflection on the gross incompetence of the Government in pursuing policies which, outside the limited number of economic acolytes close to the Prime Minister, are elsewhere regarded as 100 years out of date?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00858"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the noble Lord is being less than fair. It is clear from the exchange that we have had that the reduction in employment in manufacturing has probably been taking place for about 20 years. It is also the case that employment in services in this country has gone up by 1&#x2153; million people in the past 10 years. Surely we need to recognise what is needed for the future: we need to put our investment where it will do most good. I am very glad to have been able to confirm at this Question Time that investment in this country is going up.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00859"><member>Lord Kaldor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm that Britain's share in world trade in manufactured goods, which showed a slowly rising trend in the 1970s, has fallen by 19 per cent. since 1979 and is now barely over 7 per cent.? Will he also confirm that
<col>200</col>
service industries could never provide the foreign exchange and the exports that this country essentially needs for both food and raw materials?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00860"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I must say that I am astonished that the noble Lord, with all his experience, starts to talk to me about overseas trade from this country. I am no expert, but one thing I do know: if we go into the sort of siege economy that the Labour Party would want if they were in power, we would find that the figures for overseas trade from this county would be disastrous. I do not think that there is any more to be said on that particular subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00861"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may help my noble friend by asking him to confirm that the main loss in the share of the market for manufactured goods referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kaldor, took place between 1960 and 1978, when our share of world markets was halved, and that this was because we were completely uncompetitive with the rest of the world? Will my noble friend also confirm once more that the only reason this did not show in massive linemployment under administrations prior to 1979 was that the period between 1960 and 1979 was one of phenomenal growth, when the trade of the free world doubled, which has never happened before and which will probably never happen again?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00862"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for pointing out both those points with which I agree. Perhaps I could end this exchange by commenting on something of which I have personal knowledge. Today the exports of food and drink from this county, for which many people work very hard and for which the Ministry for which I work is ultimately responsible, are worth some &#x00A3;4,000 million a year, which represents an increase of some 10 per cent. a year in those exports over the past five years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00863"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the noble Lord himself has raised the question of exports, is it not the case that this Question has to be seen against the very sad background of the fact that manufactured imports into this country have exceeded manufactured exports for the first time since the Industrial Revolution?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00864"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps we had better not go down this road too far. However, as the noble Lord will know, we have surpluses in oil and in invisibles, and it is neither necessary nor desirable to balance our trade in every commodity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00865"><member>Baroness Ewart-Biggs</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the matter of vacancies, to which the Minister referred, can he say how they are spread over the whole county? Will he also say whether they are vacancies appropriate to take in the young people who leave the youth training schemes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00866"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not have that information for the noble Baroness. However, as the vacancies are now very numerous&#x2014;as I say, they are now the highest that they have ever been for the past 4&#x00BD; years&#x2014;it can reasonably be taken that they have a good spread across different sorts of jobs and also a wide spread across geographical areas.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00867"><member>Lord George-Brown</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that two remarks he has made must be considered bothersome, even to him, when he reads them tomorrow? First, he said that employment in service industries has risen by I think 1.3 million; he also said that our investment in that had increased enormously. A little later, in answer to the noble Lord who is sitting below me, he said that exports of food and drink&#x2014;and he was involved in drink&#x2014;had increased enormously. I mean in the production of drink, my Lord Chancellor, not what you choose to think! Perhaps he knows his colleague better than I do! These two matters take&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00869"><member>Lord George-Brown</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that these two matters bother those of us concerned with manufacturing, either on the capitalist side (the provision of capital) or on the labour side (the provision of labour)? They bother us most. Of all the figures that the noble Lord has given, there is nothing that can possibly disprove that when our population is greater than ever, we are moving from a manufacturing country to a service industry country, which cannot possibly support the population. Would he please ask&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00870"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Oh!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00871"><member>Lord George-Brown</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry if I am talking too long, but it is worth it. Would the noble Lord please note that all these figures show that Great Britain, which built itself great as an industrial manufacturing country, is trying to become a Switzerland, when it cannot possibly be one?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00872"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect to the noble Lord, I said that investment in manufacturing at the present time is increasing, but there is nonetheless in this country&#x2014;as there is in other countries&#x2014;a long-term trend towards services. When we looked at the services we found that in the past 10 years the increase in employment has been of the order of 1&#x2153; million people.</membercontribution></p>

<title>US Strategic Defence Initiative</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00875">2.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00876"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00877">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00878">To ask Her Majesty's Government what communications they have received from the United States Administration about the Strategic Defence Initiative, and whether they will make a statement.</p>
<col>202</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00879"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are in close and continuous contact, through bilateral and other channels, with the United States Administration as research proceeds in the context of their Strategic Defence Initiative. The precise substance of these exchanges must, as usual, remain confidential.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00880"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the fact that of all the many statements which have come out of Washington over the last 18 months, only one has remained unchanged in that time, can the Government give the House any indication of when they may be prepared to make a statement about this matter? The statement to which I refer was the original statement of the President himself, 18 months ago, which he repeated on television in his debate with Mr. Mondale two days ago. That statement referred to the maximum form of the Strategic Defence Initiative, which would be bound to have extremely severe effects one way or another on Western Europe. Is it not the case that such an initiative would require missiles for the boost stage intercept of Soviet ICBMs to be stationed in Western Europe? Do the Government face that with equanimity and, if not, can they tell us what they are doing to avert it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00881"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is too early for the Government to be able to reach a conclusion on this matter. We are carefully studying the situation. As the noble Lord will be well aware and as he has already indicated, the implications are far reaching. Indeed, the United States' programme is a long-term one and is limited to research. Decisions on whether or not to deploy defences against ballistic missiles are several years away.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00882"><member>Lord Gladwyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, am I right in thinking that the Government do not accept the conception of the "Air Land Battle"?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00883"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with respect to the noble Lord, that is another matter, but speaking from memory, I recall that that is something which the United States has advanced outside the context of NATO.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00884"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the noble Lord say whether the Government are discussing this matter with the United States' Administration at the present time? In view of the admittedly serious implication of the initiative if it is carried out, can he give an indication as to whether any estimate has been made of its cost and what long-term effect that might have on America's commitment to NATO? Finally, what effect would it have on the future of the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00885"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so far as contacts go, they are continuing on an almost regular basis. A number of communications in both directions have taken place. With regard to cost, I am afraid that it is too early to make an estimate of what would be the cost, but I am certain that it would be very substantial. So far as the implications for the ABM treaty are concerned, neither side has signalled any intention of breaking the ABM treaty. The Government have
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0110"/>
<col>203</col>
repeatedly made clear that we regard the ABM treaty as an important element in preserving international peace and security, requiring no amendment at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00886"><member>Lord Carver</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Lord the Minister whether the Government when they come to try to express some opinion on this subject, will take note of the views expressed publicly by Professor Lawrence Freedman, professor of war studies at King's College, London, who is perhaps one of the greatest experts in this country on this subject?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00887"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we shall certainly want to take notice of all the important views that have been expressed on these matters, including the ones referred to by the noble and gallant Lord, as well as indeed those of the noble and gallant Lord himself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00888"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not time for the Government to make some representations to the United States' Government that their actions in these matters appear to be taken without full consultation? Since we are likely to be either the beneficiaries or sufferers from such actions, would it not be right that they should consult us more fully before making these changes in their policies?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00889"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is really not the case that the United States' Government have proceeded without consultation in this matter. As I said in the main reply, consultations are now continuing most fruitfully.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00890"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the Minister is obviously right to distinguish research from procurement, does he really imagine that once 28 billion dollars have been spent on research, any American President, whoever he is, will be able to face down the military industrial complex when they demand continuity of employment and the purchase of the weapons which would have been developed through the research?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00891"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no question of taking any decisions about procurement in this matter at this time. Indeed, the kind of sums of money which have so far been spent on ABM defence are nowhere near the sort of figures to which the noble Lord has referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00892"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not the case that 28 billion dollars is scheduled to be spent on research by the United States' Administration over the next four to six years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00893"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there is no question of arriving at a conclusion on these matters overnight, any more than there is of spending overnight the kind of sums of money to which the noble Lord has referred.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Race Relations in Employment</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00894">3.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00895"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<col>204</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00896">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00897">To ask Her Majesty's Government what actions they have taken to promote good race relations in employment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00898"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government have firmly set themselves against all unlawful discrimination and are resolutely committed to promoting good race relations in employment by securing equal treatment and opportunity. The Commission for Racial Equality has a statutory duty to work towards these ends, and has produced a Code of Practice, which came into operation on 1st April.<lb/>
The Department of Employment's Race Relations Employment Advisory Service gives help and guidance to employers and trade unions on issues which can arise in the management of a multiracial workforce. It is currently giving priority to advising on the Code of Practice.<lb/>
The Manpower Services Commission seeks to ensure equal access for people of different races to all its public employment and training services and also supports language training to improve the employment prospects of members of ethnic minorities.<lb/>
In addition, the Government have adopted, in agreement with the Council of Civil Service unions, a policy for race relations in the Civil Service. The Government are determined to ensure full equality of opportunity in the Civil Service for people from the ethnic minorities both at the recruitment stage and in their subsequent careers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00899"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that it will give considerable satisfaction in all parts of the House that the Government have taken an initiative in this field? Could he say whether not just manufacturing industries but service industries, recreation and sport, are all being encouraged? Has he any special areas where there is a good success story of achievement?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00900"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his welcome to the reply which I gave. In the difficult employment climate that we are in there are two hopeful signs so far as this question is concerned. Black people have undoubtedly made some advances in employment in the public health and transport services, and there has been a significant growth in self-employment and private businesses among Asian people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00901"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Government, as an employer themselves, say what evidence there is of the results of their own equal opportunities policy, which I think they produced in 1974? What evidence have they to show that this policy is achieving results? In particular have the Government at any time as an employer made use of those sections of the Race Relations Act which allow special training for members of ethnic minority groups for areas of occupation in which they are greatly under-represented?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00902"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are no recent Government statistics available of unemployment
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0111"/>
<col>205</col>
among the ethnic minorities. So far as concerns the second question that the noble Baroness asked, it is appropriate and helpful under Section 37 of the Race Relations Act for my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment to designate other bodies to provide discriminatory training. I understand that some of the London boroughs and the industrial training boards have been so designated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00903"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord agree that on this question not really a great deal can be done by legislation and that it is much more a question of education generally? Would he also agree that it would be a good thing if those who came to this country from abroad were a little more prepared to adopt our way of life, and that all the effort cannot be made just on one side?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00904"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord mentions education. I think that the House will be glad to hear that the Manpower Services Commission language training for linemployed young people under the training opportunities scheme last year reached out to 1,750 people in the ethnic minorities who needed language training. The industrial training service, which is funded by the Manpower Services Commission and is administered by local education authorities in areas of high ethnic population, reached out to over 11,500 people last year. The third point which is interesting is that this year we are spending some &#x00A3;70 million on Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1966, which of course is money precisely for trying to reduce racial disadvantage, including support for salaries of training and career officers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00905"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while the House will welcome the statement of the noble Lord on the actions of the Government in the field of employment in regard to ethnic minorities, is it nevertheless not an unhappy fact that the percentage of linemployment among ethnic minorities, especially, alas, the young blacks, is far higher than in regard to the rest of the population?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00906"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that that is undoubtedly true. The remedy of course must lie in the success of the Government's policies to promote an economic climate conducive to competitiveness and growth, but at the same time we must not underestimate the importance of the employment and training special measures of the Manpower Services Commission on which &#x00A3;2&#x00BC; billion are being spent this year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00907"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that he did not really answer my question? Perhaps I did not make myself clear. I was concerned to find out what the Government as a direct employer inside the Civil Service have done to promote the employment and promotion to appropriate levels of members of ethnic minorities and whether they have made use for their own internal purposes of the special training facilities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00908"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I said in my. original Answer, a policy was worked out with the Council of
<col>206</col>
Civil Service Unions earlier so that we have a written document about non-discrimination with the Civil Service, but that indeed is not to say that the Government were not recognising and complying with the provisions of the 1976 Act since that Act came into force: indeed they were.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-00910">3.11 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00911"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Lord Lyell)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 17th July be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00912">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am sure your Lordships will be interested to know that this order deals with two aspects of the fire services in Northern Ireland. First it deals with the constitution, the powers and the duties of the fire authority for Northern Ireland, and then it goes on to deal with fire precautions. The order will re-enact, with two important amendments to which I shall return, the legislation which establishes the fire authority for Northern Ireland as the sole fire authority for the Province, and sets out its composition and functions. Part II of the order corresponds largely to the Fire Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 as modified by the Fire Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00913">The first amendment relates to the method of appointment of the chairman and vice-chairman of the authority. At present they are elected from among 17 members of the authority. It is now proposed that, while the authority will still consist of 17 members, the chairman and vice-chairman will be appointed for a four-year term with 15 other members. In adopting this new procedure no criticism is implied of the present or previous holders of these posts, for each has rendered service to the authority and to the community: rather the amendment seeks to bring the fire authority into line with other major public bodies in the Province. The housing executive, police authority and electricity service&#x2014;those three important bodies&#x2014;have their chairman and vice-chairman appointed rather than elected. The second amendment which I mentioned seeks to bring the position of the chief fire officer into line with that in Great Britain. At present the chief fire officer is responsible to the authority for the work of the brigade while the secretary reports to the authority on administrative matters. It is proposed now that the chief fire officer be responsible to the authority for both operational and administrative matters.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0112"/>
<col>207</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00914">Part III of the order deals with fire precautions, and again the intention is to align the law in Northern Ireland with that in Great Britain. Some premises are of course already required to be provided with what we call means of escape and fire precautions under existing legislation, but under the designation order system which we propose and set out in Article 22 a much wider range of premises can be brought within the scope of the fire precautions system. Once designated, then all premises in that particular class will be required to obtain from the authority a fire certificate which will be issued only when the authority is satisfied that the premises are provided with adequate means of escape and, if appropriate, efficient alarms, fire fighting and other fire precautions equipment. Much of Part III is concerned with the detailed workings of the fire certification system, and I do not propose to describe it in detail, although I would mention that penalties for contravention of the order are being brought into line with those for similar offences in Great Britain.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00915">The implementation of Part III will involve the authority in a considerable number of additional responsibilities, the importance of which was highlighted by the tragic fire earlier this year at the Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast. As has already been indicated, additional funds are being made available to the authority to provide for the creation of a further 10 fire precautions posts. In case noble Lords are in doubt, these posts are people, human beings, not stakes or things driven into the ground. I, too, was a little confused by this.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00916">Finally, Part IV restates the functions of the Department of the Environment in relation to the department's power to appoint inspectors to report on the performance of the authority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00917">I have been fairly brief. I hope that I have not cut too many comers; and I beg to move that the draft order be approved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00918">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 17th July be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00919">3.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00920"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for introducing this order. I regret that I cannot be as brief as the noble Lord has been, and I must apologise in advance. May I first say, as I have said on most of the Northern Ireland orders, that, although this is said to be mainly a consolidation measure, again we have an item of 53 articles and five schedules which we cannot amend; we can only endorse.<lb/>
My particular interest in this order is not only because of my Front Bench responsibilities but because for some five years I served in our own National Fire Service and was chairman of quite a number of Fire Brigades Union committees. The Fire Brigades Union, in a letter to the Assembly in November 1983, stressed that it is the only recognised representative body for firemen in Northern Ireland, with nearly 100 per cent. of the full-time personnel in membership and a substantial proportion of retained members. On some of the matters to which I refer I am advised by the Fire Brigades Union.<lb/>
At this stage I am certain that we ought to pay a tribute to the fire service personnel in Northern
<col>208</col>
Ireland, who are not only engaged in fire fighting work but, as we saw in the case of the fire services called to the recent tragic incident in Brighton, are also heavily involved in rescue work in addition to fighting fires.<lb/>
There was a very helpful report from the Northern Ireland Assembly, which considered this order. No doubt as other noble Lords have done, I have read the proceedings and the evidence with great care. It was unfortunate that for some reason the Fire Brigades Union had not received any communication. I say it was unfortunate. In my experience the Northern Ireland Office is very efficient, and the last thing they will do is overlook a matter of this kind; but the union did not receive communication, did not receive the order, and the secretary concerned had to obtain a copy personally. Having now had an opportunity to consider the order, which they had not when they were before the committee, there are a number of points in addition to others that I shall raise, and the information will be helpful not only to the union but to the public in general.<lb/>
I note that no evidence was given on behalf of the new fire authority, although they were invited twice so to do. The authority sent a letter after the committee had interviewed various bodies, and I shall refer to one or two of the points. I note that the noble Lord referred to the agreement of the Government to accept the recommendation of the Assembly that the position of the chief officer should be changed, and that he should act as the chief administrative officer, and not that the secretary, as previously, should undertake some of those duties. The Assembly and the fire authority wanted that, as did the unions.<lb/>
The Minister also referred to the new decision to have the Secretary of State (or, as it says, the department) appoint the chairman and vice-chairman of the new authority. The Assembly has made it absolutely clear that it would wish that the members of the authority should be left to elect their own chairman and vice-chairman. I note from the annual report of the fire authority that the Minister (then Mr. David Mitchell, Parliamentary Under-Secretary) sought the authority's view on this particular proposal. The authority replied that in its view the practice that the members should appoint the officers should continue. It sent a letter to that effect to the Assembly.<lb/>
Despite having asked for and received the authority's view, the Minister rejected it. I should like to know why it was rejected. The Assembly wants it, the fire authority wants it, and the Fire Brigades Union wants it. Although the noble Lord said that this brings the matter into line with other public bodies in Northern Ireland, it does not bring it into line with all other fire authorities in Great Britain, which act as committees of local authorities and elect their own chairmen.<lb/>
Article 8 lists various sections of the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) which are to apply to the fire authority as if it were to a district council, but there appear to be two glaring omissions. Sections 121 and 122 of the 1972 Act, which relate to the minutes of proceedings and public notices of meetings, are not included in the list under Article 8. I need hardly stress that the fire authority is a public body, which spends public money, but it would appear that the public are not informed of meetings of the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0113"/>
<col>209</col>
authority. Yet I understand that if a member of the public got to know that there was a meeting and attended, he could claim a public seat under Section 23 of the 1972 Act, which is embodied in this particular article. It would appear that the fire authority should be in the same position as the fire committee of other councils in Great Britain.<lb/>
Minutes should also be available. I understand that even the regional secretary of the Fire Brigades Union of Northern Ireland does not have this information about meetings and does not have copies of the minutes. May I say in passing that I showed the secretary of the Fire Brigades Union a copy of the annual report of the previous fire authority, and the union had never seen that either.<lb/>
Under Articles 6 and 7 are the requirements involving the fire authority for the provision and maintenance of hydrants and water supplies. These are at present embodied in various sections (Sections 5, 6 and 7) of the Fire Services Act 1969. These requirements are to be withdrawn from the fire authority and handed over to the DoE's water division. I need hardly stress that hydrants and open water supplies are vital to any fire service, and this provision in the new order will mean that the fire authority's expertise will be lost and the authority's own direct labour force will be jeopardised in this matter.<lb/>
The sections of the 1969 Act are compatible with Sections 13 to 16 of the Fire Service Act 1947, which applies to Great Britain, and I note that this particular question was raised not only by the unions but in the consideration given to the matter by the Northern Ireland Assembly. I note that views were expressed on behalf of the department that a lesser body&#x2014;namely, the fire authority&#x2014;cannot give directions to a higher authority, the department or the Government.<lb/>
Nevertheless, I see in the annual report, on page 20, under the heading, "Provision of Water for Fire Fighting", an extract from Section 5 of the Fire Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. I quote:
<quote>"It shall be the duty of a fire authority to provide and maintain &#x2026; such fire hydrants as are necessary for securing &#x2026; water in case of fire".</quote>
If a lesser authority cannot instruct a higher authority, how did that happen in the case of the two fire authorities which existed before the completely new Northern Ireland Fire Authority was established? I should like to ask the Minister why they could not accept the Northern Ireland recommendation 2.3 in Chapter II. Perhaps I may quote it:
<quote>"The Committee notes the Department's contention that a Government cannot be required to do something by a subordinate authority. It recommends, therefore, that Article 6 be amended to require the Department to provide a constant supply at an adequate pressure to hydrants located on the advice of the authority within 28 days of being notified of the need to do so, and that such other consequential amendments of Article 6 as may be required are also made".</quote>
I cannot understand why the Government cannot accept that particular recommendation.<lb/>
While on the subject of hydrants and water supplies, I note that the annual report of the previous fire authority states that no provision is made for formal recording or maintenance of open water supplies apart from the preparation of particular cards. Naturally, it
<col>210</col>
is common sense that cards of open water supply should be available for the personnel on fire appliances. It seems incredible to me that there is not available at the central headquarters a general record of open water supplies. The whole general question was raised by the Assembly, and I have asked about that particular point.<lb/>
Article 9 deals with the preparation and submission of an establishment scheme. There is some concern at the reluctance of the Government to provide some sort of safety valve on this question similar to that which is in the Great Britain Act. That provides for a public inquiry at the discretion of the Secretary of State. Article 9 contains no such provision for Northern Ireland. I cannot see any just reason for not doing so.<lb/>
In that connection it is convenient to move on to Article 50 because that retains a previous provision for the appointment of an inspector or inspectors. But the new order omits any reference to special practical experience required of a person or persons appointed to such posts. I am advised that there has been no actual appointment since 1969, even though the provision has been there. Instead, on occasions as required the Home Office inspectorate has been requested by the Department of the Environment to carry out inspections of the Northern Ireland fire brigade and to make recommendations. As this provision for the appointment of an inspector or inspectors is included in the new order, may I ask this question? Is it intended to continue with arrangements to make an appointment, or is it intended to use the Home Office inspectorate for this purpose? If an appointment is to be made, what specialist knowledge and expertise will such an appointee be required to possess; and why is that point not included in the article?<lb/>
I referred to the absence of provision for a public inquiry on matters relating to the establishment scheme. I note that Article 51 refers to inquiries, but there is a difference from Section 33 of the Fire Service Act 1947 as it applies to Great Britain. That provides for public inquiries. Article 51 refers to "local or other inquiries". It does not include the word "public". Clarification is needed here. What is the Government's intention with regard to the possibility of holding public inquiries where they seem to be appropriate; and could Article 51 be used for an inquiry or investigation into a particular incident or a particular outbreak of fire?<lb/>
The 1969 Northern Ireland Act included provisions for the establishment of a fire service advisory council similar to the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council in Great Britain. But by referring to Schedule 5 of the new order we see that these provisions&#x2014;that is, Section 32 and Schedule 4&#x2014;are repealed. This will leave the Fire Authority for Northern Ireland without a specific advisory body to deal with standards of appliances, equipment, procedures and similar matters.<lb/>
I understand that the advisory council was never actually appointed. There was mutual agreement that the work of such an advisory council would be repetitive of that established in Great Britain. However, can the House be assured&#x2014;this is the important point&#x2014;that in the absence of provision for an advisory council within this order, the department
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0114"/>
<col>211</col>
and the fire authority, together with its brigade, will continue to accept and maintain Great Britain's Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council standards and recommendations? We note also that Schedule 5 repeals Article 6 of the Fire Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973, especially the addendum to paragraph (<i>b</i>)of Section 16 of the main Act of 1969. That protected the standards of terms and conditions of employment of personnel. If we give praise to the Northern Ireland fire personnel, we ought to ensure that their standards of employment and conditions are properly observed.<lb/>
In the light of the repeals I have mentioned, we need a definitive statement from the Minister. I am certain he will agree that the firemen of Northern Ireland must be treated no less favourably than their colleagues in Great Britain. Can the House be assured that the department, the fire authority and the brigade will accept standards and recommendations of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities' Fire Brigades and will continue the Northern Ireland Fire Authority's membership of that body?<lb/>
Reference is also made to Article 10, where the Assembly has urged that the word "may" should be changed to "shall". This is on the question of a pension scheme. I note also that the Assembly urged that retained personnel shall be included in a pension scheme. The DoE and the Fire Brigades Union are in complete agreement that matters such as this should be considered on a Great Britain basis, applicable also to Northern Ireland. There is also at present a pension scheme for whole-time personnel, so that particular question is somewhat academic. However, the Fire Brigades Union points out that it tabled a proposal for a pension scheme for retained personnel. That matter was involved in a court action and therefore has been <i>sub judice</i>; but I should be very grateful if the noble Lord could say what is the present situation.<lb/>
The last point I have to raise concerns Part III of the order, which deals with fire precautions. As the noble Lord has done, we welcome the fact that these points are included. My advisers on this issue have studied this order and the provisions for fire precautions along with the Great Britain legislation. I am told that there are a number of omissions and differences; and there is one example in particular. Article 27 is identical, word for word, with Section 6 of the Great Britain legislation, but with one important exception. Subparagraph (<i>f</i>) of the Great Britain legislation is left out of the Northern Ireland article. I quote:
<quote>"In the case of factory premises, particulars as to any explosive or highly flammable materials which may be stored or used in the premises".</quote>
I am assured that this is a very important matter in relation to the contents of the fire certificate, the issue of which was referred to by the noble Lord in his opening statement. Can the Minister explain why this important point is left out of Article 27?<lb/>
In conclusion, can the Minister also say whether or not there are any provisions in the Great Britain legislation on fire precautions which are not included in this order, which may mean that the provisions for Northern Ireland are less favourable than those for Great Britain? When the Assembly considered the issue of fire certificates, they raised the question of
<col>212</col>
occasional entertainment letting of premises which are used for worship. While the Assembly recognised that the fire risk concerning premises used mainly for worship is rather low, there is a possible danger where the question of occasional entertainment activities is concerned. The DoE's view is that this is a matter which ought to be considered as being applicable to the whole of Great Britain; and it is a point that I can accept. However, in addition to considering this matter in particular, the Assembly recommended that the Government should examine the adequacy of legislation regarding the granting of entertainment licences, particularly occasional licences. I therefore ask the Minister whether this is to be done.<lb/>
I apologise for having taken up time, but as we cannot amend this order, and as the personnel represented through the Fire Brigades Union are agitated about some of those points, any information that the Minister can give in reply and any assurances that he can give in answer to those requested will be important.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Foreign Affairs Council: Luxembourg</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00921">3.35 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00922"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that your Lordships will forgive me if I intervene now to repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement about the Foreign Affairs Council which I attended in Luxembourg on 22nd&#x2013;23rd October, as well as on the main developments in the Community during the Recess.<lb/>
"I am arranging for a note on the other issues discussed at this and other Councils during the Recess to be published in the <i>Official Report</i>.<lb/>
"Considerable progress was made in the negotiations on the accession of Spain and Portugal. Community positions were agreed and communicated to the Spanish and Portugese Foreign Ministers on a number of matters including olive oil, where a position designed to prevent the development of a surplus was adopted; and to the Spanish Foreign Minister on industrial tariffs, where the Community's position provides for the more rapid reduction of high Spanish tariffs and an extended reduced duty quota for cars. The Council adopted a declaration noting that agreement had been reached on most of the main issues in the negotiations with Portugal and looking forward to the accession of both countries to the Community on 1st January 1986.<lb/>
"In addition to the Ministerial meetings held with Spain and Portugal there was also a meeting of the EC/Jordan Co-operation Council.<lb/>
"In the Council, I made clear our concern at the Commission's latest scheme for sales of intervention butter and whether in particular this was compatible with the Community's obligations under the GATT.<lb/>
"More generally, considerable progress has been made in the Council towards implementing the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0115"/>
<col>213</col>
Fountainebleau agreement and resolving the outstanding budget issues. The Foreign Affairs Council on 2nd&#x2013;3rd October adopted the 1985 provisional draft budget within the one per cent. VAT ceiling and sent it forward to the European Parliament. Agreement was also reached to provide 1,000 mecu of supplementary finance through an inter-governmental agreement to cover the Community's inescapable financial obligations for 1984. The Council noted that our willingness to participate in that agreement would depend on release by the European Parliament of the United Kingdom's refunds for 1983 and agreement on the measures necessary to guarantee the effective implementation of the principles of budget discipline agreed at the European Council. The Council reaffirmed the commitment of the European Council that the 1,000 mecus abatement of our contribution in respect of 1984 will be made on the revenue side of the budget in 1985.<lb/>
"Substantial agreement on a satisfactory text on budget discipline was reached at the ECOFIN Council on 1st October. The Irish presidency is now conducting further consultations with a view to reaching final agreement at an early meeting of the council.<lb/>
"On 10th October the European Parliament voted to release the United Kingdom's refunds, amounting to about &#x00A3;440 million net. Ninety per cent. of gross refund, i.e. &#x00A3;538 million, is due to be paid to the United Kingdom in the course of the next few days."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>

<section>
<title>WRITTEN REPORT ON OTHER FAC ISSUES</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00924">There were three meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council during the summer recess. That on 2nd and 3rd September, at which my honourable friend the Minister of State represented the United Kingdom, dealt exclusively with the negotiations for Portuguese and Spanish accession which I covered in my Statement to the House earlier today. At the other two Councils, on 17th and 18th September and 2nd and 3rd October, I represented the United Kingdom accompanied by my right honourable friend the Minister of Overseas Development. My right honourable friend the Minister for Trade was present at the 17th and 18th September meeting. My right honourable friend the Minister of State attended the 2nd and 3rd October meeting.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00925">At both councils Ministers discussed the negotiations on a successor to the second Lom&#x00E9; Convention, in preparation for the EC/ACP Ministerial Negotiating Conference which was subsequently held in Brussels from 9th to 12th October. Negotiations between the Community and the ACP countries are continuing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00926">The 17th and 18th September Council adopted the regulation on the strengthening of the common commercial policy. This improves the Community's ability to respond to illicit trading practices by third countries, in a manner consistent with the Community's existing international obligations. The council also adopted the long-delayed package of 15 directives laying down common standards for a range of industrial products. Her Majesty's Government welcome this useful step in opening up the internal market.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00927">At the September meeting we drew attention to the need for a further supplement to the 1984 duty-free newsprint quota sufficient to meet the requirements of Community users to the end of the year. This has now been agreed. There was also discussion of Portuguese demands for greater access this year for her textile exports. The Commission stressed the urgency of a new agreement with Portugal.
<col>214</col>
The Council considered the problem of the famine in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially Ethiopia. The Commission reported on what the Community has already done to help and undertook to assess what further action was required. As my honourable friend the Minister of State (Mr. Rifkind) told the House on 22nd October, the Community subsequently agreed to ship a further 35,000 tonnes of wheat to Ethiopia.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00928">The 2nd and 3rd October Foreign Affairs Council agreed a strongly worded declaration, emphasising the Community's concern at the protectionist provisions in the Omnibus Trade Bill before the US Congress and the potentially serious consequences were they to be adopted. Many of the more objectionable provisions were eliminated or modified in the final version of the Bill.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00929">On 22nd and 23rd October the Council approved the transfer of &#x00A3;37.8 million from the general budget of the communities to the European Coal and Steel Community in order to finance social measures to accompany restructuring of the steel industry. This follows previous allocations for this purpose in 1981&#x2013;83 amounting to &#x00A3;127 million. The United Kingdom is a net beneficiary from the programme of social measures in the steel industry. The council confirmed the Commission's negotiating mandate for the 1985 voluntary restraint arrangements with major third country suppliers under the external steel regime. Ministers also agreed that accelerated Tokyo Round tariff cuts should be implemented on 1st January 1985 for a number of products of interest to developing countries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00930"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement, and I am of course very pleased that the negotiations on the entry of Spain and Portugal into the European Community appear now to be making some progress after the protracted meetings held during the summer. Earlier this month, we learnt about the agreement with Portugal regarding the level of permissible imported sugar cane, and today's press reports tell us that the Community are virtually prepared to receive Portugal.<lb/>
Spain however appears to be a more complex problem. Will the noble Lord comment on this and say whether progress is being made on lifting restrictions over Gibraltar, because that, throughout the period, has seemed to be one of the main obstacles&#x2014;an obstacle which we wish could be removed if the settlement was a fair one from the Gibraltese point of view. Does the noble Lord agree that the problems of the EEC budget have been only temporarily allayed? Even now they seem to be looming large, because we know that the agreed 1985 budget is too little and that demands for budgetary discipline, while giving rise to a good deal of debate, have not materialised into effective proposals as yet.<lb/>
The Statement goes into some detail about Spain, and can the noble Lord say what will be the effect of Spanish membership on Community finances? I read in the press today that the Community already has a wine surplus of 3 billion litres, which is costing in the region of &#x00A3;600 million a year either to distil or to store, and &#x00A3;600 million is also the amount agreed for the 1984 supplementary budget. Will the noble Lord agree that we cannot afford to enlarge this burden, even in the good cause of assisting Spain and Portugal, and will he be able to assure the House that this will not in the event be permitted?<lb/>
The Statement refers to progress on fisheries policy. We have read a great deal about fisheries recently and about the incident in the Irish Sea. Spain has a fishing fleet of around 17,000 vessels&#x2014;I think about 70 per cent. of the Community total. Does the noble Lord agree that we could not possibly contemplate the continuation of such a large figure by comparison with the fleets of all the rest of the Community put together, including our own?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0116"/>
<col>215</col>
It is an unhappy task to have to reiterate and emphasise our concern about the Community budget and the direction in which it is tending, especially when at the same time we wish to welcome Spain and Portugal into the Community. We look forward to trading more freely with Spain and Portugal as tariffs are lowered and trade restrictions removed. Can the noble Lord predict whether the cutting of the present 34 per cent. tariff on British cars into Spain will have ramifications for the linemployment in this country, high enough as it is, and the car industry generally in Britain?<lb/>
However, the budget question remains a sensitive and serious issue which could still threaten the harmony between member states. Will the noble Lord assure the House that all efforts will be made at the Brussels enlargement meeting on 12th and 13th November to secure firm expenditure control, which seems to us to be absolutely essential? Is the Minister optimistic about the success of that meeting, and is he now confident that enlargement will occur as planned on 1st January 1986?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00931"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while associating myself with the very pertinent questions of the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, I must say that, on the face of it, this Statement is very welcome if rather surprising in the circumstances. I had not thought it would be so forward-looking as it is. I have only two questions. One is that, like the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, I imagine that most people have thought that the most difficult of all the problems under discussion will be that of fisheries, for obvious reasons. The difficulties were emphasised by the recent happenings off the coast of Ireland. But happily, as it seems, if we take the Statement as gospel, it says that
<quote>"Progress has also been made towards a common position on fisheries".</quote>
Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether this represents substantial progress and whether there is, on the face of it, reason to suppose that even on this most difficult of all questions agreement will be reached fairly soon, thereby permitting the entry of Spain into the Community.<lb/>
I have only one other small question. I note that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made clear our concern at the Commission's latest scheme for sales of intervention butter and wondered whether, in particular, this was compatible with the Community's obligations under the GATT. If it is incompatible under the GATT, perhaps the Minister can say how it is now proposed that the butter mountain, which has reached very considerable proportions, should be reduced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00932"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00933"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord will allow me first to answer the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, and the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn. On the question of Gibraltar, I do not think I have very much more to add on that matter than the answers that I gave in the House the other day on a similar question. We certainly continue to regard it as inconceivable that the restrictions presently in force, particularly on the land border, can remain in place after Spain joins the Community. The Spaniards are
<col>216</col>
well aware of our views on that matter, and indeed have subscribed to the Lisbon agreement which provides for the removal of those restrictions and for other matters. We ourselves stand ready to implement, of course, and now look to the Spaniards to do likewise.<lb/>
Many of the other matters raised by the noble Lord, Lord Cledwyn, will, I think, be covered in the reports that I shall be circulating in the <i>Official Report</i> and the noble Lord may like to study those in due course. Certainly I agree with the noble Lord that the problems of the budget, particularly the common agricultural policy, which really is at the core of the budget problems of the Community, need very careful attention between now and the time when Spain joins the Community. She is, of course, a substantial agricultural producer. Indeed, she is a rather efficient agricultural producer and the other members of the Community will need to have regard to that.<lb/>
We certainly look for an early and significant reduction in the duty on cars entering Spain, which is at a very high level compared with the duty charged on Spanish cars entering the United Kingdom. This is a problem which is not peculiar to the United Kingdom but is certainly one which we feel very keenly, and indeed some progress was made on that matter at the recent Council to which I have referred. Certainly we believe that we are on course for Spanish accession to the European Community in January 1986, but I have to agree that there are a number of difficulties still to be resolved.<lb/>
On the question of fisheries, I cannot say that that matter has been solved. It certainly has not. A little progress was I believe made at the Council recently, but there are still many difficulties to be overcome in that particular regard and further discussions will certainly be necessary. On the question of butter, I do not think I have anything in particular to add to what was in the Statement. In fact, the Commission's proposals fall into two parts. There is the prospect of butter being sold within the Community generally at concessionary rates at Christmas time and there is now an additional aspect to the same proposal, which is a disposal of considerable quantities of older butter, which no doubt will find its way to the Soviet Union. The Government have made their views plain on that matter and we have, as the Statement said, raised the question of whether or not such disposals strictly fall within the GATT agreements. Those, I think, were all, or at least the main, points raised by noble Lords. As I said, I will circulate additional reports in <i>Hansard</i> which I hope will be of assistance to noble Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00934"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can there be a distribution of wine at Christmas?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00935"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a happy thought, but the matter to which Foreign Affairs Ministers addressed their attention at the recent Council was the distribution of butter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00936"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of your Select Committee on the European Communities, which, as your Lordships will be aware, recently reported on these matters which the Council of Ministers have now been considering, may I ask the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0117"/>
<col>217</col>
Minister whether in the note which he is going to provide to the House there will be details of agreements reached about the effective containing of expenditure under the budget, and particularly the containing of expenditure under the common agricultural policy, which is an essential prelude to any agreement by this House and the other place to the increasing of the VAT contribution to the European Community?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00937"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that the noble Lord has put his finger upon one of the most important issues at present facing the European Community. The views of the British Government on this matter have never been in any doubt. Nevertheless, we wish to be constructive, and I shall ascertain what additional information I can make available to the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00938"><member>Lord Merrivale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could my noble friend say in what areas agreement was not reached, to what extent this will delay progress in the negotiations and whether this could affect Spain's accession to the Community on 1st January 1986? Would my noble friend agree that in effect the Lisbon agreement is a dead duck?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00939"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not agree for a moment that the Lisbon agreement is a dead duck. As my noble friend may recall, the Lisbon agreement was signed in 1980. The British Government have stood ready to implement that agreement ever since. The Spaniards have from time to time asked for clarification of certain aspects of the agreement, which we have endeavoured to provide. They have confirmed that they hope to be able to implement the agreement in due course. But the Government's view on the matter is very clear, and I hope that it will be in the mind of my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00940"><member>Lord Merrivale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could my noble friend answer the first part of my question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00941"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend asked me to tell him the areas upon which agreement has not yet been reached. I have to say that on the matters to which I have referred final agreement has not yet been reached. I have reported progress to your Lordships, but not final agreement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00942"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those who were at the meetings which took place so recently and which Ministers attended must have been aware to some extent of the dreadful situation in Ethiopia. I am wondering whether that situation featured at all on the agenda, and, if not, whether any initiatives are likely to be taken by the Minister through his connections with the European Community over the distribution of surpluses in order to assist Ethiopia.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00943"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although this matter was not specifically discussed at the Council of Foreign Ministers to which I referred, I understand that my right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has decided that we should make a further major contribution by directing that the balance of our national food aid allocated for this
<col>218</col>
year&#x2014;over 6,000 tonnes&#x2014;should be made available to Ethiopia. In addition, we shall provide &#x00A3;5 million in drought-related assistance to Ethiopia and to other African countries which are in need. I am told that &#x00A3;5 million will buy about 20,000 tonnes of grain. If the other members of the Community contributed proportionately, that would mean an extra 100,000 tonnes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00944"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could my noble friend clear up a point on Gibraltar, which he dealt with the other day with less than his usual high standard of clarity? Do my noble friend and the Government accept that it would be inconsistent with membership of the European Community for Spain to continue to obstruct the use of her airspace to aircraft seeking to use Gibraltar airport?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00945"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to tell my noble friend that this is not a matter for the European Community. Spain is not preventing access to Gibraltar airport although, as the noble Lord is well aware, difficulties arise over the Spanish prohibited area which lies adjacent to it. As I have already said, this is not a matter which lies within the competence of the European Community, but it is one upon which the Spanish Government are in no doubt as to our views. My noble friend wrote to me immediately following our exchange the other day. I have it in mind to reply at some length to my noble friend as soon as I can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00946"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while welcoming the statement made by the Minister with regard to the assistance given by the United Kingdom Government to Ethiopia, could he answer the question as to whether Her Majesty's Government propose to take initiatives through the Community in order to encourage the Community to respond to this situation by the distribution of some of their vast surpluses?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00947"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is for the Commission to initiate action. Nevertheless, I do not believe we can do better than to create an example which we hope others will follow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00948"><member>Lord Ardwick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the Minister could end this exchange on a cheerful note by agreeing that one important blockage has at last been removed, and that life can begin again at Brussels, with all its difficulties and complications?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00949"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not quite sure to which great new dawn the noble Lord is referring. I recall quite a number of those during the course of the life of the European Community. Progress has certainly been made on this matter, and we hope for a successful conclusion in due course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00950"><member>Baroness Llewelyn-Davies of Hastoe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, could the noble Lord help the House over the position on enlargement? We very much welcome the statement from the Commission that they look forward to the accession of Portugal and Spain in January 1986. We note also from the statement that the Community positions were agreed and communicated to the Spanish and Portuguese Foreign
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0118"/>
<col>219</col>
Ministers, and that all appears to be happy and optimistic. Yet, as reported in <i>The Times</i> today, the Spanish Foreign Minister said, "At first glance the Community seems a long way away from us". There seems to be a little uncertainty in many parts of the House about the position on enlargement. I wonder whether the Minister could enlarge upon that subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00951"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can do no better than to repeat the words which I used the other day&#x2014;not verbatim, but in essence&#x2014;when we discussed this matter. The Government very much support the principle of Spanish and Portuguese accession to the European Community. We are working to negotiate our way through the inevitable difficulties which are created by that proposal. We have passed quite a number of the difficulties, and have solved some of them. We are now working to resolve the remainder. We still believe that it is desirable and probable that the European Community will be enlarged by the addition of Spain and Portugal in January 1986.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00952"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although the appalling problem of starvation in Ethiopia and elsewhere was no part of the discussions in the council, none the less we are grateful to the noble Lord for the information that he has been able to let us have today. I believe that I speak on behalf of the whole House when I say that in view of the information which has come forward following the exchange on this subject which we had in the House on Friday of last week, we would expect Her Majesty's Government to take action with our partners in the Community, or, if necessary, alone, up to the point of chartering ships to take grain to Ethiopia, just as we chartered ships to go to the Falklands. Would the noble Lord be good enough to press this point on his right honourable friend?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00953"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly take note of what the noble Lord says, but I have announced today an additional bilateral contribution to the problems of drought and famine in Ethiopia. It is difficult to imagine setting a better example than that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00954"><member>Baroness Llewelyn-Davies of Hastoe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise for returning to the subject, but may I ask the noble Lord whether the reports which he is to place in the <i>Official Report</i> will more clearly define the Community positions on Spanish and Portuguese accession which are referred to in the Statement? Will they more clearly define what exactly the Community positions are?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00955"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there will be some additional information in the documents which are to be incorporated in the <i>Official Report</i>. However, I am not today in a position to announce the completion of the negotiations. That has not yet been achieved. There are still some difficulties to be overcome. That is why I cannot go further than I have.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Fire Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1984</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00956">3.59 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00957">Debate resumed.</p>
<col>220</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00958"><member>Lord Hampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, for introducing the order. The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, put many questions. I, too, have a few questions to ask. The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, paid tribute to the brave efforts of the fire services in the Province, with which we should like to be associated.<lb/>
We are told that this order consolidates, with amendments, the law relating to fire services in Northern Ireland and makes fresh provision with respect to fire precautions. The noble Lord the Minister has done something to clarify the amendments to the law and the changes to the system. Can he please further clarify if and how&#x2014;I am not quite clear about this&#x2014;the law in Northern Ireland will differ from the law in the rest of the United Kingdom?<lb/>
The troubles in the Province have been going on for some 15 years and the battle against the danger of fire is comparable to the battle against terrorism in general. In each case, total success is unattainable without quite exceptionally severe restrictions which would be intolerable in a free society. I shall be grateful if the noble Lord can comment. In Part II of the order, Article 4(2) states:
<quote>"The Authority shall make the provision required under paragraph (1)(<i>a</i>) by securing&#x2014;(<i>a</i>) the services of the fire brigade to meet efficiently all normal requirements"&#x2014;</quote>
and I emphasise the word "normal". In times of accepted threat from terrorist bombings, what would abnormal requirements be? Perhaps the noble Lord will comment also on Article 5(1)(<i>e</i>), which states that the powers of the authority shall include the power:
<quote>"to pay to any persons who render services in connection with the extinction of fires and the protection of life and property in case of fire such rewards as it thinks fit, which in the case of a member of the fire brigade may be"&#x2014;</quote>
and here is my emphasis&#x2014;
<quote>"in addition to the renumeration of any such member".</quote>
What is the significance of those words?<lb/>
In Article 10(1)(<i>a</i>) there is the rather surprising statement that the department may by order provide:
<quote>"for the establishment and maintenance of one or more pension schemes"&#x2014;</quote>
and so on. Does this mean that a pension scheme is only just being considered? It also amazes me that it is felt necessary to state in Article 12(1), dealing with accounts, that:
<quote>"The Authority shall keep, in such form as the Department, with the approval of the Department of Finance and Personnel may direct, accounts of all moneys received and of all moneys paid out by it".</quote>
Am I right in thinking that one penalty of consolidation is that nothing, however obvious, can be left out?<lb/>
Article 22 contains a list of uses of premises for which a fire certificate is compulsory. This is difficult because one tragic accident will bring the call for tighter precautions. I know of charitable organisations in Britain who have been put to great expense by having to install fireproof doors where none has been considered necessary before. I shall be glad if the noble Lord can comment on why no fire certificate is required in respect of Article 23(<i>a</i>):
<quote>"any premises appropriated to, and used solely or mainly for, public religious worship".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0119"/>
<col>221</col>
Presumably the fire-fighting techniques of the congregation are considered adequate in themselves.<lb/>
Finally, can the Minister say how the proportion of Protestants to Catholics is balanced in the fire service?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00959"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank both noble Lords&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00960"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: I am sorry, my Lords, but may I ask one short question before my noble friend the Minister replies? What scope is there under this order for a voluntary element or for a part-time element in the fire services? Such elements are very prominent and useful in some countries on the Continent, and could be very useful in Northern Ireland. I am sorry to interrupt my noble friend in that way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00961"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: Not at all, my Lords. I thank all three noble Lords who have spoken and all noble Lords who listened to my exposition of this somewhat complicated order this afternoon. The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, was kind enough to give me more than adequate warning of the points he was going to raise. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, since my necessary absence in the Province prevented me from getting in touch with him. Perhaps I might have done better, but I will certainly ensure that the channels of communication will be better on future occasions. However, I believe that I shall be able to satisfy most of the noble Lord's questions.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, mentioned the Assembly and its recommendations. I am sure your Lordships will be interested to know that the Assembly made no fewer than 13 recommendations on the draft order. Of these, the Government accepted one for immediate action; they accepted four for action at the appropriate time&#x2014;when, for example, other regulations are in the course of passing through your Lordships' House&#x2014;and they accepted six further recommendations on which there was agreement following some clarification.<lb/>
It follows that the Government found themselves unable to accept two of the Assembly's recommendations. One related to the composition of the fire authority, where the Assembly believed that a totally elected authority of 17 persons was appropriate. The other recommendation concerned a pension scheme for part-time firemen; the Government were unable to accept the Assembly's recommendation concerning that particular aspect. I have one or two further points to raise on the question of pensions in a few moments.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, further raised designation of the fire and rescue services. It has been remiss of me to delay until this point my thanks for the tributes paid by the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Hampton, to the fire services who performed so heroically in Brighton recently&#x2014;and to all the fire services who provide in similar, non-fire situations, a rescue service as well.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, may be interested to note that Article 5(1)(<i>g</i>) of the draft order states that the authority is empowered to employ the brigade:
<quote>"for such purposes other than fire-fighting purposes as it may think fit".</quote>
<col>222</col>
I hope the noble Lord will agree that this wide power covers the point he has in mind.<lb/>
The noble Lord also mentioned fire hydrants. The existing arrangements for the supply of water for fire fighting purposes have been in force since 1973. Article 6 would re-enact the provision of the Fire Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973 requiring the authority to arrange with the Department of the Environment for the provision and maintenance of these fire hydrants. Your Lordships may be interested to note that Article 35 of the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973 empowers the Department to:
<quote>"enter into an agreement with the fire authority for the provision of adequate facilities for making water available for the purpose of fighting fires".</quote>
Your Lordships will see that no formal agreement exists at this point, but there is a close working liaison at divisional level between officers of the water service and the fire authority. This takes the form of consultations as to the location of hydrants when new mains are being laid and the operation of hydrant patrols by the authority. The department aims to remedy any defects as quickly as possible.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Hampton, both mentioned the question of a pension scheme for retained persons in the fire service. I am able to tell your Lordships that pay and conditions&#x2014;which include pensions&#x2014;for all firemen in Northern Ireland are identical to those which are determined by the national joint council for local authority fire brigades in Great Britain. I hope that will go some way to reassure both noble Lords.<lb/>
In common with their counterparts in Great Britain, retained firemen in Northern Ireland do not have a pension scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, mentioned the absence of a scheme. That is indeed being challenged at the moment in the courts in Great Britain. We are awaiting that judgment and thus it would be inappropriate for me to comment or speculate on that matter.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, raised also the question of the fire authorities in relation to their giving of advice to the Government. The draft order charges the authority or indeed the department to carry out fairly specific, and some quite specific, functions in this particular respect. I take one example. In Article 4 the authority is charged to provide an efficient fire service while the department is charged under Article 50 to appoint inspectors. There is the closest link between the various departments on a day-to-day basis in carrying out their separate duties under Articles 4 and 50. Therefore, we do not feel that it is necessary, or indeed practical, to enshrine the detailed aspects of what is a major problem; but, of course, there are new problems arising all the time. We do not think it is necessary to enshrine in the order this link and this liaison in legislation.<lb/>
The noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Hampton, raised the question of churches and, above all, the problem of churches which might be used for public functions from time to time. Your Lordships will notice that Article 23(<i>a</i>) exempts what are known as,
<quote>"premises &#x2026; used solely or mainly for, public religious worship."</quote>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0120"/>
<col>223</col>
It exempts these premises from the need to have a fire certificate. I am advised that if the fire authority considers that a church is used substantially for other purposes, it can require a fire certificate to be applied for. Therefore, this is a matter of degree resting with the discretion of the authority.<lb/>
I should like to dwell a little on this point. There are two main types of case where a church might be used for a non-ecclesiastical purpose. The first example would be if the church was used occasionally for an orchestral concert, a play, or something of that nature. Such uses might attact the need for certain basic safeguards to be imposed; for example, forbidding the locking of doors or, alternatively, banning the use of naked flames or highly inflammable drapes, although it takes some imagination to think of a play of such nature being performed in a church&#x2014;perhaps "Murder in the Cathedral" would be such a one. Indeed, the regulations might require chairs to be battened together or require the provision of an adequate number of attendants to assist with the audience. However, these are all matters which could without any difficulty be included in regulations. The noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Hampton, would, I think, agree that for an occasional performance of this kind it would be inappropriate to apply the full controls of a fire certificate.<lb/>
The second example of a church being used for non-ecclesiastical or non-religious purposes might be where it belongs to a less well known denomination and consists of a small assembly room on the upper floor of a building or in a separate part of the building. It might be an office block, which I understand is the case in one or two areas in Northern Ireland. In that case the church may already benefit from controls under other legislation which would apply to that building or to the premises as a whole. Even if it did not, the regulation-making power under this part of the order&#x2014;this is still Article 23&#x2014;would be sufficient to ensure that adequate means of escape and the other fire precautions were provided. I do not think I should take your Lordships down any more fascinating ecclesiastical avenues as to whether a church might or might not be used for the purposes.<lb/>
The noble Lord Underhill, asked about Article 8 and mentioned notices. Quite rightly, he asked about a notice or minutes being given to the Fire Brigades Union. Article 8 requires the authority to publish notice of its meetings, but I am afraid there is no provision in the draft order for the minutes of the authority to be made available. This is not the case in Great Britain, where minutes are available for inspection by electors. I hope your Lordships will accept that this difference reflects the differing composition of the repective fire authorities, with the Northern Ireland authority being comprised only partly of the elected representatives. My honourable friend in another place is examining this particular issue and I shall certainly ensure that all the points raised by your Lordships, in particular this one, are brought to his notice.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, also asked about inquiries and public inquiries. This appeared to be in relation to the article dealing with the submission of an establishment scheme. He will find this in Article 51.
<col>224</col>
Article 51 merely empowers the department to hold an inquiry, but such inquiries attract the provisions of the Interpretation Act of Northern Ireland of 1954. This provides that such inquiries may be public. I think the noble Lord will accept that where there is genuine concern his fears will be met.<lb/>
Article 50 deals with inspectors. This comes in Part IV, on the functions of the department. Article 50 merely seeks to renew what is current practice on the appointment of inspectors and the department will continue to rely on the services of the Home Office Inspectorate in these particular matters.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, referred to two other major points. The provision in the 1969 Act for an advisory council is to be repealed. I am advised that no advisory council was ever appointed under the old Act. I see the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, nodding his assent. I give the noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Hampton, the assurance which I am sure they seek in relation to the maintenance of standards on, first, advice, secondly, performance and, thirdly, conditions of employment. All these three points will continue to be the standards which are applicable in Great Britain, through the mechanisms which are already known as the Home Office Inspectorate and the National Joint Council for local authority fire brigades.<lb/>
Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, referred to Section 6 of the British legislation and Article 27&#x2014;the parallel provision in the order we are now discussing&#x2014;and, above all, the omission of sub-paragraph (<i>f</i>) in Section 6 which deals with factory premises and the storing of explosives. This does not represent any derogation from British standards whatever because the omission of the storing of explosives on factory premises in Article 27 represents no change from the standards. Explosives and their control are reserve matters and are dealt with under the Explosives (Northern Ireland) Order.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, had one more point which concerned Fire Brigades Union consultation. I understand that a copy of the order was sent to the Northern Ireland secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, but I am advised that he had moved home and I regret to say that it took some time to arrange for a copy to be made available to him. I apologise for this omission. Indeed, I find that where a recipient moves home, normally the Post Office or neighbours are very helpful and can give some advice as to where he is to be found.<lb/>
In addition to the points he raised on churches and pensions, the noble Lord, Lord Hampton, drew attention to the use of the word "normal" which occurs in Article 4. I am advised that the staff of the brigade in Northern Ireland regularly attend all fires to which they are called. These can include fires which are provoked by terrorist action. I understand that there are other aspects to that. The fire brigade will attend any fire, but, of course, in terrorist incidents the security forces have to take the first action.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Hampton, also asked about Article 5(1)(<i>f</i>). I understand that this provides that payment by way of reward may be made to persons who are present in connection with the extinction of fires or indeed who assist in this process. I am advised that this is to reward particular acts of bravery, or
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0121"/>
<col>225</col>
indeed assistance to the brigade. I understand that it is permissive far more than anything else.<lb/>
I hope that I have answered all the queries that have been raised&#x2014;I must apologise; I was forgetting my noble friend. I understand that he is quite right. Very valuable assistance is given by, I think he suggested, part-time firemen. I understand that they are paid or rewarded on the same basis as in Great Britain. I also understand that the strength of the fire brigade and fire services in Northern Ireland is considerably reinforced by the use of, as I think my noble friend suggested, part-time firemen. I think that I can probably obtain the approximate strength in numbers of these part-time firemen, so, if I may, I shall write to him briefly on that point. I stress to my noble friend and to all your Lordships how grateful we are in Northern Ireland to all members of the fire service, both part-time and full-time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00962"><member>Lord Hampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord did not reply to my question about the proportion of Catholics to Protestants in the fire service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-00963"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise. That was one point which I seem to have lost amid the sea of papers. As I understand it, the proportion is something in the region of 83 per cent. Protestant and 17 per cent. Catholic. If I am wrong, I shall certainly write to the noble Lord. He will of course be aware that the fire service interviews and selects on an entirely non-denominational basis; the first parameter being that applicants must be suitably qualified for the duties which they may undertake. I understand that that is the approximate figure. If I am wrong I shall write to the noble Lord.<lb/>
Finally, I should like to thank everybody who has taken an interest in this specially difficult problem of the fire services which affects us in Northern Ireland. I should like to pay tribute to the continuing devotion to duty and bravery of all the firemen and other people concerned with the fire service in Northern Ireland. I commend the order to your Lordships.</membercontribution></p>

It has not exactly been an urgent Government priority. I only regret that they did not take my advice when I suggested that they should lose the Bill between this House and the other place. I call it the "James Mackay Memorial Bill". We could have done quite well without it. I do not know whether the Lord Advocate saw a note that I passed to the Government Whips where I suggested that we really should take these amendments page by page. There are only three or four that are worthy of comment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01036"><member>Lord Hughes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in moving the amendments <i>en bloc</i>, the noble and learned Lord said he would answer questions about any of them. I do not want to object to their being taken in that way. As a matter of fact, I should have been quite happy had he taken the amendments from beginning to end <i>en bloc</i>. They seem to be a draftsman's paradise.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0123"/>
<col>229</col>
I wanted to ask a question which concerns various parts of the Bill. For instance, in Amendment No. 17 there is reference to, "a proposed road". The phrase "proposed road" is also used in Amendment No. 28, but Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 talk about,
<quote>"proposed road in course of construction".</quote>
Quite honestly, I do not understand how a proposed road could be in course of construction. As soon as construction starts, it becomes a road.<lb/>
That would appear to be the position when we get to Clause 144, where Amendment No. 210 says:
<quote>" 'proposed road' means"&#x2014;</quote>
and I will leave out the words in brackets which refer only to public roads&#x2014;
<quote>"a new road in course of construction, or proposed to be constructed, by or on behalf of any person".</quote>
It seems to me that in its zeal for change the other place has had rather misguided enthusiasm for adding still further to the matter by having these different definitions, when the interpretation appears to make the difference unnecessary. Perhaps the Lord Advocate will elucidate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01037"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to Lord Ross for the welcome that he gave to the return of the Bill to this House. I am sure that when he referred to my predecessor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, he was not intending to suggest that it was not necessary to have him in this House.<lb/>
However, if I may just deal with the question put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, with regard to proposed roads, I think that your Lordships may recollect that when the Bill was originally before the House, the definition of "road" included a reference to a proposed road. The result of that was that with such a definition of the word "road"&#x2014;and of course the word "road" only appeared throughout the Bill as it was then before the House&#x2014;it could have had somewhat unfortunate consequences in several of the clauses as they were then drafted.<lb/>
I give but one example to indicate why that should be. There was the offence for an owner letting a child under 16 drive his horse and cart in a road. That would have applied whether the road was in being or whether it was as yet unconstructed&#x2014;merely a figment of the planner's mind.<lb/>
So far as the second part of the matter to which Lord Hughes referred&#x2014;the use in certain circumstances of the term:
<quote>"proposed road in course of construction"&#x2014;</quote>
that is because the definition, "proposed road", contemplates not merely a road which is actually in the course of construction but also a road which has as yet merely been planned&#x2014;that is to say, one which is on the drawing board and has not yet got to the stage of construction. But, of course, there are circumstances in the course of the Bill when it would obviously be inappropriate that clauses should refer simply to a road which is at that point on the draftsman's board and not in the course of construction. I trust that my attempts to allay your Lordships' fears are at least in part successful.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01043">Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendment.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01044"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate could perhaps help me in my interpretation of this amendment. Could he tell me what safeguards the local authority or the road authority would have if there was a very long delay between the starting of a scheme, for example an estate of houses, and the building of a road. A point could be reached in which because of a long delay, there could have been a considerable escalation of cost over what was generally agreed as being a reasonable bond for the local authority to complete the road. However, as I understand it, if the contractor is not able to complete the road, the roads authority must do the work. Therefore, it could take a long time to complete the housing estate, since obviously the roads are only partly completed while the construction traffic is using them. On the other hand, severe difficulties could be encountered when the road was being constructed. It would, perhaps, be beneficial to an unworthy contractor who decided that he would not complete the job and wished the local authority to complete it.<lb/>
I should like to know this. With regard to Clause 16(4), which provides that any dispute between a local authority can go to an arbiter, would the arbiter be enabled to increase the liability of the contractor for the bond under circumstances such as I have tried to describe, or under some other, I agree hypothetical but frequently quite realisable, circumstances?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01045"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think there are two matters which arise. The first matter is in relation to the question of the cost of making up a road
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0124"/>
<col>231</col>
in the event that construction consent has been granted. Your Lordships will recollect that this is a requirement first of all under Clause 16 and thereafter by way of application under Clause 20. It is anticipated that Clause 20(4), which provides that it shall be a condition of any construction consent that the construction be completed within such a period as the local roads authority may specify in giving consent, will be the basis upon which the local roads authority would of course determine what is the amount of the road bond to be provided under Clause 16(2).<lb/>
Obviously they will look forward to the period of time which they give in relation to completion of the road as being one of the factors to which they will look in fixing an appropriate sum. I can simply say that where there is a dispute it would be a dispute between the local roads authority and the particular person in regard to the amount which the local roads authority are intending to fix. It would be within those parameters that an arbiter would operate. So far as I can see, that would seem to be a perfectly sensible way in which to proceed in relation to a security by way of a road bond. Your Lordships are well aware that it is for that purpose that the provisions of road bonds have been brought into Clause 16 of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01046"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate quite sees the point. We are not arguing about the bond. We are not arguing about what has been fixed by the local authority and the circumstances in which, and the procedure whereby such a deposit may be applied, and so on. We are talking about the actual fact that the local authority is left with an obligation to complete a road and the bond itself may not be sufficient, for all sorts of circumstances. What happens then?<lb/>
Remember, it may well be that the builder or the person constructing the road has gone bankrupt, so that it is no use going to him. It is a case of going to whoever would own the houses, who normally and probably would have already paid, in the cost of their houses, their share of the construction of that road. Who is going to come to the relief of the local authority in that case, where the bond is not sufficient to meet the cost?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01047"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my response to that must be this. In the kind of situation which has been postulated by the noble Lord, some construction has already taken place within the period afforded for the construction of the road. As noble Lords will understand, the bond itself is for the full cost of the road before construction. So, in so far as the road has already been constructed, that is expenditure which the local roads authority would not then have to meet. I should have thought that in general terms the balance would probably be fully met out of the road bond provision.<lb/>
All I can say is that in the unlikely event that there was an excess over and above the road bond provision, as I understand it in such circumstances it would have to be the local roads authority that would meet the difference. However, my submission to your Lordships is that this would be very unlikely. One would contemplate the situation where there had already been a part making-up of the road, and of
<col>232</col>
course the road bond provision is to cover the whole making up of the road. I hope that I have made my sense plain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01048"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate may have made his position or the Government's position about this clear to others; but I am afraid that it is not very clear to us. He says that this is very unlikely to happen. May I tell him that it has happened? May I also tell him that the bond is surely not purely to cover the local authority's liability but the fact that the person constructing the road may not have paid for those who are constructing it on his behalf. He may not have paid for the materials. There are more than the local authority who have the claim upon that bond. So, the fact that some work has been done does not mean to say that it has been paid for. I am sorry that this matter has not been raised at an earlier stage, but it is not the fault of the noble and learned Lord. This is not the noble and learned Lord's Bill.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01085">Amendments Nos. 86 and 247 implement a recommendation of the committee which was chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Stodart of Leaston. It was a recommendation, supported by COSLA, that responsibility for the provision and maintenance of bus shelters should be confined to regional or islands councils as part of their general responsibilities for local transport matters. At present, district councils have a concurrent responsibility with regional authorities. All but one of the regional councils already accept full responsibility for bus shelter provision and maintenance. The amendments therefore provide for uniform practice throughout the country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01086">The new clause added by Amendment No. 182 is necessitated by the transfer to the regional councils of district functions relating to bus shelters and road lighting, and again both these are recommendations of the committee that was chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Stodart of Leaston. This new clause allows for property to be transferred from district councils to the local roads authority&#x2014;most notably this would be road lights and bus shelters&#x2014;and for the transfer of any staff wholly or mainly employed by the district councils on either of those functions.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01088"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is one of the more respectable clauses in this rather silly Bill. The question must arise: why did the Government wait until this got to the Commons before they put it in? After all, Lord Stodart's committee reported in 1981, and that is now getting on for three years ago. We are all conversant with the actual clause. I think it was chapter 14 and paragraph 207 of that report which dealt with the subject of bus shelters and also with the cleansing. We had a Bill on this subject. Once again, it is pretty unfair to ask a new boy to explain the delays of the Government and their muddled thinking in respect of this. We had an actual Bill on the subject of Stodart. No wonder the noble Lord, Lord Stodart, is not here. He is ashamed that his Bill should be handled in this dilatory way. If the noble and learned Lord opposite has received an explanation, if the cavalry are as good as they used to be, then he might let us have it.</membercontribution></p>

<quote>("22A. Section 96(1) (leaving animal on, or Level 3.") allowing it to stray onto, road).</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01186">Amendments Nos. 164 to 166, and Nos. 169, 170 and 227 were made in the light of comments that were received from two sources. The first was from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the second was from COSLA. The amendments make three distinct changes to Clause 96. The first change is that since the straying of an animal is a safety hazard which should be prevented on any road, the clause is no longer confined to public roads. I would point your Lordships to the definition of a road in the definition clause of the Bill, which provides that a road is that over which the public have a right of passage, and comprehends, of course, not only public but private roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01187">Secondly, again bearing in mind the need to secure safety on the roads, under the clause the police have been given the same powers of seizure and detention as road authorities have. Again, I suggest to your Lordships that this is compatible with that need. For instance, police in a patrol car or (dare I say it?) on foot might well be able to seize and detain an erring animal and perhaps prevent a bull in a china shop situation developing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01188">Finally, provision in existing legislation which makes it an offence to allow an animal to stray on a road has been reinstated. It appears that the mere existence of such an offence has had a salutary effect on
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0128"/>
<col>239</col>
those responsible for animals. But, in order to ensure that nobody is unjustly convicted through no fault of his own, the amendments have made it a defence to prove that all reasonable steps were taken to prevent the animal straying. Amendments Nos. 167 and 168 ensure that an owner will not be required to pay the costs of detention of his animals if they strayed onto a road through no fault of his own, perhaps because walkers left a gate open. The owner would not be required to make such payment if he has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that his animals do not stray onto a road.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01189">Moved, That this House doth agree with the Commons in the said amendments.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01190"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am merely checking the progress of the Bill at this point so that we can be told exactly what change in the law there is. In certain parts of the country there have been occasions when, if an animal strayed on the road and a motorist hit it, the motorist, rather than the owner of the animal, was liable. What I want to get clear from the Lord Advocate is, first, what is the present law, and, secondly, what change this makes?<lb/>
Noble Lords will remember that there have been one or two recent cases in Scotland&#x2014;one a very serious one&#x2014;where animals strayed. They strayed not only on to public roads but actually on to a railway track and caused a very serious accident. That is not necessarily covered by this. I do not think the permanent way is covered even by the strange language that we have in this Bill. I should like the Lord Advocate to make it absolutely clear to everyone exactly what the present law is and what change is being made by this.<lb/>
It is not going to be very easy to prove that any farmer deliberately left a gate open. This is rather important. I heard of a recent case in Dumfriesshire where a car driving along a trunk road was suddenly confronted by a bull. The car was travelling at about 40 or 50 miles an hour. The car hit the animal, but what might well have been a serious accident fortuitously and happily turned out to be a mishap rather than an accident. But who is responsible? It is easy for the farmer to say, "Someone else opened the gate", or, "Somebody broke down the fence". As far as I can see, the change that is made here&#x2014;the Lord Advocate can correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;is that it gives a reasonable "out" to the farmer and reduces the possibility of any help to the motorist, or the pedestrian, for that matter, who is harmed by a straying animal, as in the case I cited.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01191"><member>Baroness Elliot of Harwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am concerned about the areas where there are unfenced roads. In the Borders, for example, there are a great many sheep and one cannot fence all the roads because it would involve miles and miles of fencing. Nearly always there is a notice saying, "Beware of sheep". But if there is not, and if the animals are in the way and one cannot possibly fence the roads, what happens? Whose responsibility is it if an animal is killed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01192"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me deal first with the matter of the offence. The amendments re-enact the offence which existed in terms of the
<col>240</col>
Roads and Bridges (Scotland) Act 1878. However, they provide the defence&#x2014;which is set out&#x2014;that all reasonable steps were taken to prevent the animal from straying. I want to make it quite clear that the reason why this has been reinstated is that it is the view of the authorities most interested in this matter that the existence of such an offence has been salutary and obviously, as your Lordships will understand, anything which tries to contain animals from straying on to roads where vehicles or others may pass, is something to be commended. I would merely say in regard to the question of proof that these are obviously matters which the prosecution will have to take into account when it is considering whether any prosecution should follow.<lb/>
But I still say and suggest to your Lordships that it is appropriate to have this provision on the statute book for the purpose for which it is there; namely, to secure safety on the roads. Perhaps I should say that of course this is in relation to criminal law; it does not deal with the liability arising under the civil law which is the type of case of which the noble Lord opposite was perhaps thinking, where there may, I appreciate, be difficulties in proving negligence where there has been a straying animal. For the very same reason it may be that the owner of the animal cannot be traced or, if traced, may have taken all reasonable steps to prevent the animal straying.<lb/>
The noble Baroness asked me about the situation when animals stray on to roads that are unfenced. Again it would be a question of the owner taking reasonable steps in those circumstances to prevent the animal straying on to the road. I do not think that I can assist your Lordships further on this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01193"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate would agree that the result of a prosecution would considerably affect the result of a civil action. Can the noble Lord tell me how many prosecutions there have been in, for example, the last year or so in respect of owners allowing their animals to stray on public roads?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01194"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not in a position to give that information, but I should be happy to write to the noble Lord with the information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01195"><member>Lord Hughes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, further to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Elliot of Harwood, about unfenced roads and with reference to the terms of Amendment No. 170, would the putting up of a notice saying, "Beware of sheep" on unfenced roads, be regarded as having taken "all reasonable steps", not to prevent the animal straying, but to warn people of the possibility?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01196"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a lawyer is always very cautious about giving legal advice in a matter of this type, particularly since the amendment provides that it is for the defence to prove that all reasonable steps were taken to prevent the animal straying. No doubt one of the matters which the court could well take into account would be the provision of notices informing the public of the danger. However, I obviously cannot give any undertaking and would

not seek to do so to your Lordships. It must always be a matter for the particular circumstances of the particular case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01233">These amendments have been introduced following representations by local roads authorities and by the police about problems which exist in applying speed limit control provisions, especially those arising out of the classification of roads as restricted roads.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01234">As your Lordships will be aware, a "restricterd road" is automatically subject to a 30 miles per hour speed limit. The basic criterion for such a road is that it has a system of street lighting with lamps not more that 185 metres apart. Under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967, a second determining factor was that a road was unclassified or, if it was a trunk or classified road, had a system of street lighting prior to 1st July 1957.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01235">As a consequence of those provisions it became difficult as time passed to establish which roads had lights prior to that date in July 1957. Accordingly, problems arose with prosecutions for speeding offences on some roads. In the Transport Act 1982, amending provisions aimed at remedying the situation were introduced, but these have proved complicated to operate. They have had the adverse effect of applying a 30 miles per hour limit, whether appropriate or not, to any road on which lights are installed. To apply the appropriate limit, roads authorities were faced with a wasteful requirement to make individual speed limit control orders. The amendments made by the 1982 Act also made reference to a specific date&#x2014;1st November 1982&#x2014;and that has caused problems which they were meant to solve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01236">As your Lordships are aware, the existing provisions within these Acts were consolidated in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. It was accordingly considered as a result of the representations by the local roads authorities and the police that it would be best to bring in a method of classifying roads as restricted roads which would be simpler to operate. This would also result in a revised system of speed limit control which would not require the re-education of drivers and which would involve minimum public expenditure. The amendments implement such a system. They are amendments which have been agreed in discussion between the Scottish Office, local authorities, the police and the Crown Office. They provide that "restricted roads" will be those which are of a class or type specified by the Secretary of State in regulations and which have a system of carriageway lighting provided by lamps not more that 185 metres apart.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01237">In proceedings for a speeding offence on a restricted road, a certificate, signed by an officer or the Secretary of State, as to a road's classification or type will be evidence of the facts certified. Other roads will of course be subject to the prevailing national speed limits. In all cases however a roads authority may impose a different speed limit on a road by order, subject to compliance with relevant procedures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01238">In order to enable existing speed limits to be maintained which would otherwise be affected by the changes, the amendments empower roads authorities to make transitional orders. These orders can be simply made. Since they will maintain the <i>status quo,</i>
<col>244</col>
they will not require to be advertised and no provision is made for objections to them.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01241"><member>Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate for his explanation of these particular amendments. The House will also be hopeful that the amendments will do the job which he expects them to do. I do not think there is any doubt that the link between lighting and speed restrictions in many cases is now outdated. The noble and learned Lord will be as aware as I am that in Scotland the M.8, the A.77 and the A.74 are fairly long stretches of road which have been released from restrictions, and to these roads the standard national speed limits apply.<lb/>
There is some genuine concern at what the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State said at the Committee stage in another place. He said:
<quote>"I hope the House will agree that the existing position is near to complete collapse."</quote>
He continued:
<quote>"It is evident that a revised system of determining speed limit control is necessary".</quote>
This was after the amendment of the 1982 Act which it was hoped would clear up the matter of speed limits. This is where I and a number of other people and groups become slightly concerned. The amendment of 1982 was introduced with a little panic and some haste in order to stop a gap. I understand that the gap had become so wide that in many circumstances certain police forces were not willing to risk trying to prosecute. One gets an uneasy feeling that in this particular instance, this amendment coming as late in the Bill as this, there has perhaps been some panic in trying to standardise the whole question of the speed limit.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate said that there had been consultation with local authorities and the police. I should like to know whether, for instance, any of the motoring organisations, any reputable authorities concerned with traffic or any other organisations concerned with lorries, freight transport, and so on, have been asked for their impressions of the proposed amendments to the Bill. Perhaps most important of all, I should like to know what consideration was given to the Department of Transport's paper, <i>Restricted Roads</i>&#x2014;<i>an Alternative Approach</i>, a copy of which I was only able to obtain this morning. That is the speed at which things appear to be changing. It appears as though in England and Wales the Department of Transport is moving away from the idea that lighting should determine what the speed limit should be and that they are talking about an overall urban speed limit with exceptions within that urban area.<lb/>
Therefore, if these amendments go through&#x2014;and I have no doubt that they will&#x2014;it could very well be that, according to the suggestions of this consultative document from the Department of Transport, Scotland would have a different system from that which operates in England and Wales. As there is much cross-border traffic, it seems to me that there
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0131"/>
<col>245</col>
should have been a little more correspondence between the two bodies&#x2014;the Scottish people involved in road traffic and the Department of Transport.<lb/>
It was unfortunate that the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 was amended in such a way that the Secretary of State is under no duty to consult. I know that it is always difficult to name names or to make specific recommendations as to who should be consulted; but if the Secretary of State and his officers know that they have a duty to consult people, I am sure that they know exactly to whom to go to get a respectable and reputable opinion on new legislation. These are important points, and it is perhaps unfortunate that if new regulations are adopted in England and Wales which prove better, we shall fairly soon have an amendment to this particular Bill.<lb/>
Finally, in the phrase:
<quote>"a system of carriageway lighting furnished by means of lamps placed not more than 185 metres apart"</quote>
why was the word "carriageway" used when in every other part of the Bill almost every reference to "street" or "highway" has been thrown out and replaced by the word "road"? What is the precise meaning of "carriageway" in this connection? Is the expression actually defined in the Bill for the purposes that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate and the Bill intend?<lb/>
This is a very late amendment. I am not sure that it will work. We all have reason to be slightly unhappy about the history of the speed limit law, particularly in Scotland, and perhaps it would have been better if a little longer time had been taken before an amendment had been made in the existing regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01242"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for having raised these points, and in some ways perhaps it is an omission on my part that I have not made the distinction clearly enough between the matter of classification and the actual signing of roads. I think that the signing of roads will remain the same on both sides of the border, and therefore so far as the ordinary driver is concerned he will notice no difference.<lb/>
The purpose of this amendment is to provide a better way of classifying roads as restricted roads&#x2014;a way which will not be subject to the vagaries of past legislation&#x2014;in requiring that there should be both a system of street lighting and then, in addition that a road was unclassified, or if, it was a trunk or classified road, had been provided with such a system of street lighting prior to a certain date.<lb/>
As I understand it, proposals are presently being considered in England and Wales on the method to be adopted to classify restricted roads which may or may not fall in line with the proposals which are suggested in these amendments. I think it proper to inform your Lordships that what is pesently in mind in England is one of the alternatives considered by the authorities, to which I referred. It was considered that the system which is now presented in these amendments was a better one and had the added advantage that it involved a minimum of public expenditure. I am sure that your Lordships will support such a course.<lb/>
So far as the last aspect the noble Lord asked me about is concerned, the reason the phrase "carriage-
<col>246</col>
way lighting" is used in these amendments is that it is simply to make it clear beyond peradventure that it is lighting which is aimed to fight up the road&#x2014;that is, the roadway on which vehicles pass&#x2014;as opposed, as is sometimes the case, to lighting which is directed merely to lighting a footway; that is to say, that along which foot passengers, and not vehicles, pass. I hope that with these explanations the noble Lord's fears are to a large extent allayed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01243"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should be happy with that explanation if it told us anything. The noble and learned Lord mentioned the system in these amendments. What is the system in these amendments? Am I right in thinking that these amendments only give power to the Secretary of State to specify what is a restricted road? We know what the system is, but we do not know what it is going to be.<lb/>
Concerning the explanation of "carriageway", I do not know whether the noble and learned Lord knows it, but "street" is a dirty word. We are coming, I think, to Amendment No. 226 to Schedule 8, and the purpose of this schedule is to get rid of the word "highway". I do not know what we are going to do with the <i>Highway Code,</i> because there will be no such thing as a "highway" in Scotland after we pass this Bill. Streets are out, roads are in. We are going to codify and modernise the language and here we go back to the word "carriageway". A more gracious way of living is evoked by the word "carriageway", rather than by what we are now presented with, and we are told that this is to light up the roadway. We have gone right round in a circle.<lb/>
I have said that the draftsmen have gone mad on this Bill. Take Schedule 8 that we are now on, with Amendment No. 226. It started out with 26 pages. By the time it left this House it had 60 pages. By the time we finish it today and we agree to these amendments&#x2014;and we are all going to agree to them, because I am so sick of this Bill that I would agree to anything&#x2014;nothing at all will be added, apart from two or three clauses which could have been in a small Bill and gone through this House in no time. There will now be 71 pages for Schedule 8.<lb/>
All it does is get rid of words which we quite reasonably understood; simple words such as "highway" and "street". Do not let me go on, my Lords. But may I have an explanation in relation to what the Lord Advocate, in all his glory&#x2014;nearly as fine looking a man as his father, who is a judge in Scotland&#x2014;tells us about this new system? What is the new system? There is no new system here. All we do is give power to the Secretary of State to produce a system. We do not know what the system is. Should I be comforted by the fact that when he draws up his new system he will consult the motoring organisations as well as the local authorities and the police authorities?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01244"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as briefly as I can, I shall endeavour to answer the points made by the noble Lord opposite. I appreciate from the remarks that have fallen from him today and from my reading of other occasions that he dislikes this Bill. However, it is only fair to say that it is at long last bringing up to date matters with regard to roads in
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0132"/>
<col>247</col>
Scotland and is repealing a considerable amount of previous legislation. I assure your Lordships that one of the great things is to try to find provisions in one Bill, rather than spread them about over a number.<lb/>
On the particular point raised with regard to the system, obviously the system depends on two things. The first is, that it is operated by the Secretary of State in regulations, and it is to deal with unclassified and Class C roads which are provided with a system of carriageway lighting&#x2014;I observe the noble Lord's dislike of the word "carriageway", though it is one which is used often even in law courts&#x2014;provided by lamps not more than 185 metres apart. If the system is adopted, it will perhaps avoid a return to your Lordships' House in due course for further amendment.</membercontribution></p>

In the amendments to Schedule 8 the sort of rough change from feet to metres has now been made into the exact figure, which makes me wonder why in Amendments Nos. 229,232, and 239 four metres becomes 3.66, but in Amendment No. 231 four metres, for some reason, becomes 3.05 metres?

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01388"><member>Lord Ross of Marnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, surely the Lord Advocate will not confine the information to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes. The rest of us are dying to know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01389"><member>Lord Cameron of Lochbroom</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am reminded, which I had forgotten, that I ought to have the information available, and indeed it is here. It goes back a long way to the Railways Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845, and in particular Section 41, with which of course the noble Lord will be familiar. I understand that that defines separate minimum arch dimensions of railway bridges over turnpike roads, public carriage roads, and private roads, and that the Bill amalgamates the turnpike and public carriage road provisions into a public road minimum clearance for railway bridges.<lb/>
However, British Rail drew attention to the fact that the obsolete turnpike standards instead of the smaller public carriage road dimensions to which British Rail now operates had been used in Schedule 8 to the Bill. The result would have been that if allowed to stand without these amendments, which in some sense are of a technical nature, the amended Section 41 of the 1845 Act would increase British Rail's costs when rebuilding existing bridges, since they might have to be reconstructed with a larger arch for vehicle clearance, that being by the obsolete turnpike standards as opposed to the standards to which British Rail now operates. I apologise to your Lordships that I did not have that explanation immediately to hand when I stood up.</membercontribution></p>

<title>British Summer Time: The Miners' Strike</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01392">5.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01393"><member>Viscount Mountgarret</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in the circumstances of the continuation of the coal mining dispute, they would consider extending British Summer Time this autumn, and if necessary advancing it in the spring.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01394">The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I should like first to express my gratitude to my noble friend the Chief Whip for allowing me time to raise this matter in your Lordships' House. I had thought to raise it before the Summer Recess, and it could then well have been argued with some justification that the matter might be hypothetical, as few people of good will could have expected matters relating to the industrial dispute in the mines to have reached the stage at which they are now.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01395">While I am sure that from every quarter of this House and from any other part of the country there is a fervent wish that this dispute should be speedily brought to a close, I feel it might be irresponsible of us not to consider taking some reasonable and painless precautions to go some way towards attempting to conserve our fuel stocks, which are bound to diminish on an increasing scale, particularly if the pit deputies' union also find that it must join in the dispute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01396">I hope very much that this Question will not lead to a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the points at issue in the mines; nor would I wish to see a general discussion on the extension, termination or otherwise of summer time as a whole as a general principle, as I feel that this is outside the scope of the question at issue. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that some of the arguments deployed in favour of the underlying principle are as relevant to a permanent situation as they are to what I would fervently hope would be a temporary arrangement.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01397">I asked questions on this subject in 1974 and 1979, but unfortunately they seemed to fall on rather stony ground. As your Lordships may remember, we had an experiment for one year&#x2014;I believe it was in 1972 or 1973&#x2014;when summer time, daylight saving time or European Standard time, however one may refer to it, was adopted throughout the winter. This led to a considerable amount of objection from all quarters. The Government then decided to revert to the practice that we had been used to adopting, which is currently in force. My questions in the years referred to aimed at seeking to extend British Summer Time for a matter of a few weeks and returning earlier thereto than had previously been the normal habit on the grounds of conservation of energy. I was advised that there would be a saving of only 150,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, which was considered at that time to be an insignificant amount. Insignificant or not, a saving is a saving. I feel that if the situation were to arise as a result of the continuation of the present dispute (which appears regrettably likely to continue) that the Government were to request everybody to carry out savings on however small a scale, they would be incorrect not to set a lead from the outset.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01398">To extend British Summer Time for a matter of some four weeks until the end of November would, as I have said before, be a painless exercise. It would be
<col>258</col>
welcomed by a great number of people, not least the farmers and those in the construction industry, and certainly all people who have their main business activities with their counterparts in Europe. At present we are on the same time as that in Europe. I can see nothing but inconvenience from aggravating the situation by putting our clocks back for no particularly good reason, thus making life rather more difficult for people in the administration of their companies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01399">I fully accept that there are some sections of the community who would find the suggestion not so attractive, in particular people who live in the far north of Scotland, where, quite frankly, at that time of year they have only about five hours of proper daylight, whatever time the clocks on the mantelpiece may say.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01400">For many of us, until the end of November it is lighter at half-past seven in the morning, Greenwich mean time, than it is at half-past four in the afternoon. I believe it is infinitely easier for the majority of people affected by daylight to go to work in the light rather than working into the darkness. The effect on children going to school should not arise, because by eight o'clock in the morning it is clear daylight by Greenwich mean time but by four o'clock in the afternoon it is almost dark. It would benefit them. If the clocks remained constant for a matter of a further few weeks, that would be of assistance rather than a hindrance. I entirely accept that during the dark months of December and January this argument does not apply, and it would be undesirable to do other than to revert to Greenwich mean time for those two months. If this unfortunate dispute were to continue after the end of January, which I sincerely hope it will not, the same arguments would apply for advancing a new start to British Summer Time next year at the beginning of February.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01401">I have had it argued with me that if the Government were to decide to make such an order it could be deemed to be giving in to Mr. Scargill and running away from the problems. I cannot accept this argument. Indeed, I feel it would have totally the reverse effect. It would demonstrate that the Government are prepared to see to it that we are determined to stick to our guns and are not prepared to submit to what appear to be extortionate and unreasonable demands, and that we are determined to take reasonable and relatively painless action from the outset to meet the inevitable inconvenience that will be caused by a continuance of absence from work in the mines.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01402">I should also like to say that I have had a very wide measure of support both from my colleagues and from Members of your Lordships' House on other Benches. Regrettably, due to the short notice of this Question many of your Lordships who have indicated a great measure of support for this suggestion are unfortunately unable to be here. Indeed, if they had known&#x2014;and I was nearly caught short&#x2014;that the previous business was likely to terminate as early as it has, I think they might have been able to be here: but, alas, they are not. But there is a fairly wide measure of support in principle.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01403">I hope that if the Government feel that there is a broad section of agreement among all the parties, there should be little reason why the necessary order should not be issued forthwith. I hope, therefore, that my
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0138"/>
<col>259</col>
Question will receive the serious consideration which I believe is its due.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01404">5.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01405"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we must be grateful to the noble Viscount for raising this issue, which has relevance in the present difficulties affecting the coal industry. It is not my intention, as indeed it was not the intention of the noble Viscount, to refer to the dispute in the coal industry except to say that we all hope that there will be an early and satisfactory settlement and a full resumption of work.<lb/>
When I knew that I was to speak in this debate my mind went back to December 1970, shortly after I was elected to another place, when there was a debate in the Commons about British Standard Time&#x2014;which, incidentally, ran for a three-year experimental period between 1968 and 1971, so it was tried for rather more than one year. I remember the debate very well: it was about standard time, and whether it should continue. I was among the small band of 81 Members who voted for the continuation of British Standard Time; but we were overwhelmed by the 366 who voted for its abandonment. That was nearly 14 years ago, and British Summer Time has operated since then.<lb/>
However, as well as looking at a number of reports&#x2014;and, in particular, Command Paper 4512, which was the review of British Standard Time published in October 1970&#x2014;I glanced through the pages of <i>Hansard</i> for 2nd December 1970, the date on which the House of Commons debated British Standard Time. I must say that I met many old friends among those pages. Some are still Members of another place, others have left voluntarily, others have left involuntarily, some have unfortunately passed on from this life, and others have been elevated to your Lordships' House. Indeed, two very notable contributions in that debate were made by people who are now members of your Lordships' House, and it is worthwhile considering what they said during that famous debate.<lb/>
They are, in fact, both Scotsmen&#x2014;and it is difficult to go anywhere in the United Kingdom without bumping into a Scot. In fact, although I was born in Wales, I, myself, have a claim to Scots ancestry. The first name that I came across in those pages of <i>Hansard</i> was that of a certain Hamish Gray, the then Member for Ross and Cromarty, who now graces the Government Benches as Lord Gray of Contin. In fact, he made his maiden speech on this subject&#x2014;and, if I may say so, a good one, indeed, it was.<lb/>
The noble Lord was for the abandonment of British Summer Time. In brief, he complained of the difficulties, particularly in Scotland, that early morning workers experienced as a result of British Standard Time, and he spoke of the very heavy extra cost incurred by industry, in particular the building and farming industries. He also complained of the dreariness of the early mornings&#x2014;I believe it is always dreary in Scotland in winter anyway&#x2014;which made it necessary when driving to use headlights until the hour of 9.40 a.m. in the depths of winter.<lb/>
But then, a few pages on, who else should I meet in those immortal pages of <i>Hansard</i> but another old friend, a John Mackie, who then sat as the Member of Parliament for Enfield, East, and who now adds
<col>260</col>
stature to our Benches as Lord John-Mackie. He was on the other side of the argument. In fact, he was on my side, as he usually is and as I hope he always will be. He, like me, wanted British Standard Time to continue and to become permanent. He pointed out that in Scotland, as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, what daylight they lost in the morning they gained in the evening. He also pointed out that, while many outdoor workers disliked British Standard Time, others, especially the old, the young and sportsmen&#x2014;and there are many of those in this House&#x2014;liked it very much. He also reminded the House that cows and other stock dislike changing time: they like some permanence; they like things to go on as usual. He also observed that milk yields dropped following the alteration of the clocks. They were some of the arguments. There are, of course, others.<lb/>
I mention those two speeches because what the Unstarred Question seeks is a return, albeit on a temporary basis, to British Standard Time; and some of the arguments for and against are contained in the two speeches, parts of which I have summarised. As I have said, there are other arguments as well that have to be taken into account. A point that I noted in particular was that during the period of British Standard Time accidents to postal workers increased very sharply indeed, and that is certainly something to which I believe the Government will want to give serious attention when considering the advisability of acceding to the request in the Unstarred Question.<lb/>
But there is one factor which the Government will wish to take into account above all, and that is this. Would the extension of Summer Time save electricity? In 1970 the electricity boards believed that any effect of time-changing on the volume of electricity sold was marginal, if any. That is a very important consideration. However, the position may very well have changed over the 14 intervening years between 1970 and the present time, and no doubt the Government will have much better information on this point than the rest of us.<lb/>
Indeed, the Opposition has altogether insufficient information to enable us to judge the issue. For example, we do not know the present level of stocks of coal at the power stations. Nor do we know what the present or future oil-burn is likely to be. We also do not know what proportion of our nuclear power station capacity is available, or what proportion of oil and nuclear power plant will remain fully available throughout the winter. Nor do we know the Government's intentions regarding the 22 million tonnes of coal stocked at pitheads and elsewhere: that is, whether it is intended at some stage to move those stocks into the power stations.<lb/>
There is a great deal of information that we would need to have to be able to make a judgment on this which we do not have. Therefore, I believe that the judgment on the issue is one strictly for the Government to make. I shall listen with great interest, as will other noble Lords, to the speech of the noble Baroness at the end of this debate.</membercontribution></p>

<col>261</col>
Unstarred Question on the Order Paper for debate this evening. I know that my noble friend Lord Ezra would have wished to take part in this debate had it not occurred on an evening when he was not able to be present. Certainly his contribution would have been of more use to the House than I fear mine may be.<lb/>
I think that to those noble Lords who were not aware of it, the fact that the NACODS strike apparently has been called off will be a source of considerable relief, as it will be on all sides of the House. I should certainly like to take the opportunity, while not getting into the argument about the coal industry, to say how much I, personally&#x2014;and I am sure that here I speak on behalf of my colleagues&#x2014;have welcomed the rational approach to this difficult problem that has come from that union throughout the whole of their negotiations with the National Coal Board, and the use which they have made of ACAS. One can only hope&#x2014;and I am sure that this will be echoed on all sides&#x2014;that this will lead to a de-escalation of the situation, and that we can all look forward to a settlement of the coal mining dispute before too long.<lb/>
That does not take away, however, from the merit of this Unstarred Question, because I think that, even in terms of energy saving as a whole, it is something that we could well debate even if there were not a mining dispute in front of us. There has been some reference tonight to the north of Scotland being a problem area for changes of time. Certainly this has been the case in earlier debates on such subjects.<lb/>
It is therefore interesting that my honourable friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland, Mr. Jim Wallace&#x2014;a worthy successor to my noble friend Lord Grimond&#x2014;raised this matter with the right honourable Mr. Walker, the Secretary of State for Energy, on 24th September and suggested that there might be a postponement of the reintroduction of GMT. The Secretary of State replied to that letter from Mr. Wallace to say:
<quote>"You will not be surprised to hear that this subject has been considered by the electricity supply industry in the past. Their conclusion was that no fuel savings would be expected because the reduction in electricity demand during the later winter afternoon peak would be offset by the increase in demand during the darker mornings".</quote>
I would suggest to your Lordships that that may be true, taking the winter as a whole; but I think that the noble Viscount, Lord Mountgarret, may have put his finger on something about which the Government have not as yet given reassurance. That is that in the shorter term the balancing offset between the evening and the morning loads may be slightly different during a period of three to four weeks between this coming weekend and the end of November.<lb/>
One would like to hear from the Government, if they are going to resist the suggestion behind this Question, that in fact the arithmetic has been done over that shorter term. We are not talking today, as the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, was talking in the earlier debate in 1971 in the other place about continuing throughout the whole of the winter. Quite clearly, as one gets into the later part of the winter the saving will be balanced; but the idea behind this Question is whether in the short term there is not some saving. I think we all suspect that there may be some saving in
<col>262</col>
this shorter period. If there is, then we should take advantage of it, if possible, for ecological reasons as well as for reasons relating to the miners' strike.<lb/>
In the Home Office's <i>Review of British Standard Time</i> (Cmnd. 4512), again it says at paragraph 153:
<quote>"Since the change in the hours of darkness has meant darker mornings and lighter evenings there has been, as expected, a shift in the demand for electricity from the evening to the morning peak period."</quote>
It then goes on to say that if British Standard Time were to be retained&#x2014;this was in 1970&#x2014;
<quote>"it is estimated that over a period of time there will be a saving in the generating capacity needed in the evenings equivalent to one power station, representing a capital cost of about &#x00A3;100m."</quote>
That of course relates to generating capacity, of which we are not short at the moment; so one does not know precisely what the relevance of that figure would be in terms of today's fuel consumption.<lb/>
The only hint I have been able to get on this was a remark on the BBC's news programme on Wednesday last, 17th October, at 6 o'clock. When referring to the expected (now defunct, I am glad to say) pit deputies' strike, it was said that when the clocks went back on 28th October the coal burn would jump from 1 million to 1.2 million tonnes per week. Like the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, we do not know precisely the proportion of nuclear burn or the proportion of oil burn which is taking place at the moment, so one does not know whether that has any relevance. But obviously one of the people preparing the news programme for the BBC thought that there would be a significant jump in the coal burn when the clocks went back. One would be glad if the Government could confirm or deny that.<lb/>
I have very little else to say, except slightly to refute what the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said about cows not liking time changes. The fact is that cows are very fortunate: they do not have time changes. It is the farmers and the cowmen who have the time changes and not the cows themselves.<lb/>
I think none of us would wish to see this change take place if it were to put at risk school children, together with Post Office workers and many of the other people referred to in earlier debates when we talked about British Standard Time going through the whole winter. But I suspect that those arguments do not apply to this short term and if, as I have said, there is evidence that there would be a saving in fuel, then I hope that the Government will be able to do something even at this late hour.<lb/>
It is perhaps worth noting this evening that the European Parliament yesterday came to the conclusion that we all ought to change our clocks on the same day next year, which will actually be a fortnight earlier than the date on which we shall change this year. That should give us pause for thought. Once again, I thank the noble Viscount for raising this Question and I look forward with interest to the noble Baroness's reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01408">5.44 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01409"><member>Baroness Trumpington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with great interest to the speech of my noble friend Lord Mountgarret, to the witty speech of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and to that of the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, whose remarks are always of the greatest
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0140"/>
<col>263</col>
interest to hear. The information contained in his speech was as interesting as if his noble friend Lord Ezra had been here in person. All those noble Lords are concerned with the possibility of saving fuel by extending summer time.<lb/>
Let me deal first with the fuel economy aspect and start by making a tremendously simple statement. There comes a point towards the end of October when it is no longer helpful to prolong summer time. By then sunset takes place at around 4.30 p.m. GMT and sunrise does not occur until about 7 a.m. If we were to make it lighter in the evenings by extending summer time, it would be even darker in the morning. Any energy savings in the evenings would be offset by a greater use of energy in the mornings.<lb/>
My noble friend mentioned the British Summer Time experiment which actually occurred from 1968 to 1971. This was not extended after a debate in another place in which the measure was defeated by a massive majority of 366 votes to 81. The Government have no reason to believe that a similar debate now would have a different result.<lb/>
In 1979 the Central Electricity Generating Board considered the effects of extending summer time throughout the winter in the light of the British Summer Time experience of 1968 to 1971, as well as of likely changes in the pattern of demand for electricity in March and October of subsequent years. It was estimated that the late afternoon peak in demand would be decreased by some 1,200 megawatts, mainly as a result of lighting-up time being postponed by an hour; but the morning peak would be increased by about 900 megawatts, mainly due to additional lighting as well as to some extra heating requirements caused by the one-hour advance in time. There would also be a more rapid rate of rise from night to daytime demand between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. The electricity supply industry concluded that the potential fuel and cost savings in the afternoons would be roughly cancelled out by the extra consumption and cost incurred during the morning pick-up and peak.<lb/>
The Central Electricity Generating Board has recently re-examined the figures and has concluded that in present circumstances the effect of extending summer time would be marginally to increase fuel consumption. This arises from the growth in recent years of off-peak electric heating. Some 2.7 million consumers are now on off-peak tariffs and the time clocks for this heating are set by Greenwich Mean Time, since the main demand for it occurs in winter. If summer time were extended, this demand would encroach on the morning peak rather than occur just during times of low system demand, as intended. Clocks could be reset but the industry officials would have to visit each off-peak consumer and the cost of such an exercise was estimated, even in 1979, at around &#x00A3;6 million.<lb/>
Your Lordships will be interested in the question of harmonising summer time with the other European Community countries. I think it is worth referring to this, even though it was not touched on in the speeches. At present there is a common starting date, and discussions about a commencing date from 1986 to 1988 are taking place in Brussels. The European
<col>264</col>
Commission has proposed that member states should end summer time on the second Sunday in October rather than at the end of October, as in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, or at the end of September, as happens on the continent.<lb/>
The Government have approached these discussions in a friendly and co-operative spirit, but we are well aware of the strong opposition to any shortening of summer time which has been expressed, particularly by those in agriculture, the construction industry and the domestic tourist industry, as well as by those who value light evenings in October for sports and leisure purposes. Shortening summer time would also mean that, in many cases, it would get dark before school half-term holidays, and particularly in Scotland, as noble Lords have mentioned, it would mean children going home in the dark for a greater part of the year. In the course of his speech the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, quite rightly included also the difficulties endured by postmen.<lb/>
Some of your Lordships may have seen articles in the press today indicating that the European Parliament has voted in favour of ending summer time on the second Sunday in October. I should point out that the opinion of the European Parliament is advisory and not mandatory in this matter, and that, despite a similar vote three years ago, the Government decided that the United Kingdom should retain its late October ending date. A further press report in the same article to the effect that the Government have indicated that they will follow the European Parliament's advice is unfounded.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, asked a number of questions about the position as to coal stocks at power stations and power station operations this winter. These questions are not material to the main point at issue, which is extending summer time. I hope he will therefore forgive me if I leave that point for now.<lb/>
I totally agree with the views expressed by my noble friend Lord Mountgarret and the noble Lords, Lord Stoddart and Lord Tordoff, concerning, we hope, a future, happy and successful ending of the coal dispute. But turning briefly to the implications of the coal mining dispute and a possible energy crisis, the Government are, of course, keeping the situation under constant review. As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy said on Monday in another place:
<quote>"The Government will continue to take all the actions that are necessary to see that the power stations continue to provide the energy necessary to protect the life of the nation and to preserve jobs",&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons; 22/10/84, col. 446.]</quote>
I, too, am delighted to learn that the pit deputies' union, NACODS, has decided not to put into effect the strike which had been threatened for tomorrow. This is good news. Let us all hope that the negotiations which are to continue tomorrow will result in real progress towards a constructive settlement of this issue.<lb/>
This has been a most interesting short debate, and we are grateful to my noble friend Lord Mountgarret for raising this topical subject.<lb/>
House adjourned at seven minutes before six o'clock.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01424">Whether they will publish figures for cot deaths in each of the health regions and districts in (i) England and Wales, and (ii) Scotland in total and sub-divided into socio-economic class of the parents, for the year 1982 and 1983; what percentage were infants of single parents; and what percentage of live births there were in each socio-economic class in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983 respectively.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01425"><member>Lord Glenarthur:</member> The available information for England and Wales and Scotland is given in the table and relates to the numbers of deaths registered where "cot deaths", "sudden infant death syndrome" or similar terms were mentioned on the death certificate. The England and Wales figures for 1982 are derived from a procedure which links deaths with the relevant births; the 1983 linked data are not yet available. Figures for cot deaths of all illegitimate babies have been supplied for 1982 for England and Wales, as these are available from the linked file. Accurate information concerning infants of single parents is not collected for either country.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01426">The tables relate to regional health authorities. Annual data are not released for individual district health authorities because the small number of events precludes meaningful comparisons. Data for aggregated years will be issued when 1983 figures become available. The 1982 data cannot be aggregated with earlier data because of changes in health area boundaries in 1983.</p>

<title>Bingham Committee: Suspension of Proceedings</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01433"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01434">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01435">To ask Her Majesty's Government why the Bingham Committee on the Law of Discovery has been suspended.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01436"><member>The Lord Chancellor (Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in May of this year the European Commission of Human Rights ruled admissible the application by the honourable Member for Peckham that the United Kingdom was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Failing a friendly settlement the commission thereupon became obliged to rule on the merits of the application. Clearly the Bingham Committee could not consider further the selfsame area of law without knowing the outcome of the proceedings before the European Commission. To avoid wasting the time and effort of the distinguished members of the committee, I requested its chairman to suspend the proceedings.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01437"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor for that Answer. However, I should like to ask him whether the abandonment of the commission is by way of a postponement of the publication of its report or whether the report will die a natural death?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01438"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord kindly repeat that question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01439"><member>Lord Morris</member><membercontribution>: Of course, my Lords. While thanking my noble and learned friend for his Answer, I should like to ask him whether the abandonment of the Royal Commission report is by nature a postponement of the publication of the report or whether the publication of the report will die of natural causes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01440"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was not a Royal Commission; it was a committee headed by Mr. Justice Bingham, and there is no report. But of course if there is not too long a delay and no friendly settlement, and the Court of Human Rights gives its judgment, I shall have to consider what I do next. The committee has only been suspended, not dissolved. It still exists, but it has not yet reported.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01447"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that reply. However, would the noble Lord agree that the figures that he has just given indicate that the number of people who will be out of work in the long term is still showing a substantial and dangerous increase? Would the Minister care to predict when he expects this reservoir of despair to begin to reduce? While I accept the measures that the Government have taken to attempt to alleviate unemployment, which the noble Lord announced in Answer to another Question last week, is he aware that the lifebelt being thrown to people in this pool of despair is nowhere sufficient? When can we expect some additional measures of an urgent nature to deal with this situation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01448"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord that there is no question that the figures are of great concern, though I am advised that they show some lessening in the rate of increase compared to a year ago. There are, I think, some encouraging signs in particular, the latest figures that I have been given show some 247,000 additional people in work compared to a year ago. The noble Lord also asked me about increased resources. We are putting massive

<col>273</col>
resources totalling &#x00A3;2&#x00BC; billion into assisting some 670,000 people who are involved in the Manpower Services Commission's special employment and training measures, with a great emphasis on training. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced some improvements in those measures within the last two to three months and I am sure that when the noble Lord heard of them he welcomed them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01449"><member>Lord Rochester</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord tell us what proportion of the doubled number of training places for adults will be on the community programme which, as he knows, is designed specifically for the long-term unemployed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01450"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it will be some 50,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01451"><member>Baroness Gardner of Parkes</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend inform me whether any records are kept of the number of job opportunities or job offers that are given to people who are unemployed, or whether we are to presume that these people have not had job offers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01452"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I gave to your Lordships' House two days ago a figure which shows that vacancies in this country at the moment are the highest that they have been for the last four-and-a-half years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01453"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Lord recall that last week I asked him about some figures concerning what he has again referred to as new employment over the past year? May we assume that he is speaking on behalf of the Department of Employment? If so, has he had time in the ensuing week to look at the figures published by his own department, which show that during the second quarter of this year the number in new employment is only one quarter of that in the last quarter of last year? Does this not show an underlying trend which is gravely slowing down the numbers placed in new employment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01454"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is one of those occasions on which both the noble Lord and I are correct. The noble Lord is absolutely right that, taking the two particular quarters which he has selected, there is some slowing down in the rate of increase of the creation of new jobs. At the same time I repeat the figure which I have been given and which I believe to be correct, which is that the latest figures available show that there are some 247,000 more people in employment than there were the year before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01455"><member>Lord Grimond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord the Minister agree that, unfortunately, many of the long-term unemployed are now concentrated in certain districts and communities? Will the Government consider introducing some new measures more specifically aimed at communities which have really lost their traditional form of employment and which are not sufficiently pinpointed under the regional aid which is at present given?</membercontribution></p>
<col>274</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01456"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment will be looking at certain of the special employment and training measures which are due to come to an end in March of next year unless anything is done and, therefore, I think that we can expect some further information from my right honourable friend. Indeed, I shall draw his attention to what the noble Lord, Lord Grimond, has said in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01457"><member>Lord Taylor of Gryfe</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister agree that the number of unemployed is unevenly distributed throughout the regions of the United Kingdom? In view of the noble Lord's concern for helping in this situation, will he explain the fact that regional employment grants have been cut by one third in the last year and by no less than 50 per cent. for Scotland? In the circumstances is that likely to contribute to a reduction in the uneven balance of unemployment in this country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01458"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that we are moving on to a slightly different question. As the noble Lord will know, aid from the Government to the regions since the present Administration came into office in 1979 has been absolutely massive. I believe I am right in saying that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is looking at the question of regional policy, but that is a matter for my right honourable friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01459"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the Minister agree that, as regards the figures that have been quoted today, the biggest single tragedy occurs at the top end of the age scale, where there are becoming unemployed an increasing number of people who may never work again? If further resources are to be made available, will the noble Lord use his good offices within Her Majesty's Government to consider allocating some of those resources to that group in order to make their permanent unemployment more bearable?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01460"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will, of course, be aware that on 30th July my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment announced that there would be a doubling of numbers for adult training. This should go some way towards trying to cope with the very difficult problem which the noble Lord has outlined.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01466"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know that it is always wrong to invite a Government to speculate, but may I ask whether, for instance, the noble Lord is able to exclude any countries which could not reasonably have been assumed to have laid the mine?

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01467"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it would be very unwise of me to speculate at all upon who laid that mine&#x2014;but I can confirm that it was not the Royal Navy!</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01469"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, mostly Her Majesty's Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01470"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware (of course he will be aware) that an international conference is to be held in, I think, Khartoum on 20th November to consider this whole matter of the Gulf and the Red Sea? Can he indicate whether or not Her Majesty's Government are taking an interest in that conference, and whether we shall be sending either a representative or an observer there?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01471"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have to come absolutely clean and say that I was not aware of the conference concerned; but I shall find out and let the noble Lord know the answer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01472"><member>Lord Shinwell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if this sort of thing can happen in times of so-called peace, what is likely to happen if there is war? One can imagine the destruction of shipping.

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01473"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord may be reassured to know that as regards mine-clearing vessels generally, we have 28 Ton class vessels, eight Hunt class vessels and two River class vessels currently in service, and in addition the single role minesweepers are on order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01474"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, seriously, I wonder whether the noble Lord can go a little further. Was the mine of a type which must have been laid by a ship or which must have come from an aircraft? Have Her Majesty's Government made inquiries of the riparian states, particularly Egypt? Have we made inquiries of the United States, whose satellite surveillance capability would probably be enough to identify the state which laid the mine?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01475"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are certainly wondering which country it is which could have laid the mine, but we would have to begin the inquiries on the basis of some evidence, and so far we have none that is of any consequence.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Weeds Act 1959</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01476">3.14 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01477"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01478">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01479">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are contemplating a review of the Weeds Act 1959.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01480"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, last year my department consulted interested organisations on the need to retain specific legislation for the control of weeds. Our conclusion, which was announced in another place on 16th February this year, was that the Weeds Act 1959 continues to play a useful role in specific areas. We have no plans to conduct a further review.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01481"><member>Lord Sandys</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend that for that very helpful Answer. Can he further enlarge on his Answer by informing the House whether it is the case that this legislation has been used on only one or two occasions, and will he also agree that that is no measure of the efficacy of the Act as such and that the fact that it exists on the statute book is often a very helpful preventive?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01482"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is right. I believe that the Act has been used only twice in the last five years, and I would entirely agree with my noble friend's view about the necessity to keep the Act on the statute book.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01483"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think it is very good that Her Majesty's Government have agreed to keep this Act. The point has often been made&#x2014;and I think that I agree with it&#x2014;that there is no such thing as a weed; it is only a plant in the wrong place. Nevertheless, the fact that the Act has been used only twice shows that over a whole area of land, particularly urban blight land, the weeds are not cleared. As I happen to farm in these areas, I would ask the Minister to make sure that, if I make a complaint, the Act will be used, because there is nothing worse than seeing thistledown floating over one's farm from unused land next door.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01484"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord makes a complaint, it will be taken very seriously.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01485"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that, as regards the weed problem, encouragement of the use of waste land and converting it into useful allotment gardens would go a long way towards controlling weeds?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01486"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted to hear the noble Lord say that, and I believe I am right in saying that the take-up of allotments in the country at the present time is very good.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01487"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord confirm that any review of this Act would inevitably involve a reshuffle of the Cabinet?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01488"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in fact, this Act applies only to five different sorts of weed. So far as I am
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0147"/>
<col>277</col>
concerned, the only thing which came out of the review was that the best thing to do with all five weeds was not to sit on them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01489"><member>Lord Soames</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can my noble friend inform me whether the Nature Conservancy Council is in order under the Act when it instructs landowners not to cut thistles and other weeds because of the existence of rare flora?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01490"><member>Lord Belstead</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if, because of a management agreement, there was such a stipulation, of course that would come within the purview of the Nature Conservancy Council. However, if one of those five weeds was causing a threat to agriculture because it was liable to spread, it would be possible to bring the Act into effect.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1984</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01504">3.20 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01505"><member>Baroness David</member> rose to move, That an Humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the Regulations [S.I. 1984 No. 1116], laid before the House on 1st August 1984, be annulled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01506">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, it is my privilege to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper. It relates to the proposed annulment of the order known as the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1984 laid before Parliament on 1st August 1984, the day before the House rose for the Summer Recess. The regulations came into force on 1st September 1984. I should like to protest at that timing, as there was no opportunity to debate those regulations before they came into effect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01507">There seems no reason for treating Parliament in this way. The National Union of Students was informed of the likely decisions back in February and a circular went out to local education authorities at Easter. Therefore, the content of those regulations was known months before. One can only assume that Ministers deliberately decided to make debate impossible before the first grants under the new regulations were paid. This is particularly galling, as Mr. Peter Brooke, when the 1983 order was debated in Standing Committee on 10th November of that year, when there was criticism of the delay, said:
<quote>"the department has already stated its clear intention to achieve a better timetable in 1984&#x2013;85".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01508">Well, it has not. Could the Minister, when he replies, please give us an assurance that we shall have the opportunity to debate the 1985&#x2013;86 regulations before they come into force?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01509">It was particularly important to have a debate this year as there have been three major changes: in the way travel costs are treated, in the parental contribution scale, and in the minimum award. As the new method of allocating money for travel is so different from that operating in previous years, and as many students will be adversely affected, I shall speak of travel costs first.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01510">Since the current grant system was introduced in 1962 it has always been acknowledged that the cost of a student's daily travel to and from college, and three return trips to the student's home, should be fully reimbursed. With effect from the current academic year new students will no longer be able to claim reimbursement of their travel expenditure above a fixed element within the main rate of grant. That is &#x00A3;100 for students living away from home and &#x00A3;160 for students living in their parental home.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01511">After pressure from the National Union of Students and other interested parties, the DES have acknowledged that students already on course would not be in a position to change their travel patterns in the light of the new regulations, and in consequence new transitional arrangements have been introduced. Nevertheless, these transitional arrangements still involve continuing students in expenditure of &#x00A3;150 from their own pockets before they are enabled to claim reimbursement of any additional travel expenses. The transitional arrangements do nothing to
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0148"/>
<col>279</col>
ease the problem for all new students for whom the closing date for UCCA applications was 15th December 1983. This has meant that they have not been able to reconsider their choice of university or college with the new financial implications of those choices in their minds.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01512">The introduction of this new policy on student travel costs will disadvantage many students. The NUS, from its surveys on student income and expenditure and on LEA awards, estimates that some 39 per cent. of all mandatory award holders will be out of pocket, with 35,000 students (10 per cent.) being out of pocket by at least &#x00A3;150, and as many as 7,000 (2 per cent.) having to find more than &#x00A3;350 from their own resources. Particularly badly hit by the new regulations are students living in their matrimonial homes and students studying in London.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01513">Students in London on average incur three times the expenditure on travel that their colleagues incur. Indeed their expenditure is considerably higher than that incurred by Scottish students, who continue to get their travel costs reimbursed, as the Scottish Office considered, in the light of data collected, that their students were a "special case", in that their travel expenditure patterns were different from the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01514">Not only will students suffer pressure upon their scant resources but there are wider implications which affect certain institutions particularly. Some under threat will be Lancaster University, Warwick University&#x2014;Canterbury University was mentioned by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Rochester when he asked a Question earlier in the summer&#x2014;and Ulster University, all of whose students have to live a considerable distance from the institution. This may deter many students from making a free choice of where they wish to study, and these institutions could become ghost establishments. The new regulations will particularly deter students from mainland Britain wishing to study at the University of Ulster. The situation really is not different from that in Scotland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01515">The cost of travel will almost inevitably mean that a student chooses not the course that will best suit his needs but a university or college where he knows he will have little distance to travel. The other inevitable consequence&#x2014;and this is already being felt&#x2014;is the pressure on accommodation close to the institution that the student is attending.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01516">Sir Keith Joseph, in answering a Question on 26th July this year on what assessment he had made of the effect that the new arrangements for student travel would have upon student housing choices, said in col. 754:
<quote>"None. It will be for individual students to decide how best to deploy the resources available to them within the overall grant."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01517">A complacent answer, my Lords.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01518">It seems quite extraordinary that no assessment was made of the possible consequences. Colleges are often in the centre or, in the case of the new civic universities, on the fringes of large urban areas, so that many students have to live considerable distances away. Portsmouth Polytechnic did some research in the mid-1970s. Thirty-five per cent. of all non-home based students lived between two and five miles from
<col>280</col>
their institution, 19 per cent. between five and 10 miles away and, surprisingly, 10 per cent. over 10 miles away.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01519">Polytechnic students in London tend to live a long way away&#x2014;15 per cent. over 10 miles. There will be inevitable pressures on all accommodation near colleges, with perhaps unfortunate effects on other more vulnerable or disadvantaged groups. There will be increasing demand on a narrow and declining section of the housing market, the private rented sector. We already hear of problems of overcrowding, sharing, and multiple occupation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01520">Local authorities and housing associations will not be able to respond to the additional and unnecessarily imposed need, given the financial restrictions on their housing activities. It seems incredible that no thought seems to have been given to these inevitable consequences of the new travel arrangements. Will the department be doing any survey or conducting any research on this aspect?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01521">I turn to the parental contribution scale. With effect from this academic year the DES has amended the method for means-testing for parental contribution. First, they have increased the threshold at which parents start to make a contribution from &#x00A3;7,100 to &#x00A3;7,600, in line, as usual, with average earnings. That is a move that we welcome, but they have also reversed their former policy of tailing off contribution as parents' income increases with a system where they now require a higher contribution from parents in the middle and high income brackets.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01522">The effect of this change means that parents with a residual income of over &#x00A3;12,000 per annum are having to pay a much higher contribution than in the past, and indeed parents with a residual income of around &#x00A3;18,000 will have to find an extra &#x00A3;466 for their child's grant over and above the amount required last year. It must be remembered that that residual income may of course be made up of both parents' earnings.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01523">In a letter dated 16th August 1978 to the former Chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students, Mrs. Thatcher herself promised to:
<quote>"conduct a thorough review of student grants. In that review highest priority will go to a reduction in the parental contribution".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01524">The reality is that the present Government have imposed a "backdoor tax" on parents and have substantially reduced the state contribution to student awards while expecting parents to contribute to the state shortfall. There have been a number of letters from parents in the papers recently complaining about this, and I shall quote from just one that appeared in the <i>Guardian</i> a few days ago. This is from two teachers who are parents:
<quote>"As so often in recent years, there appears to be a positive discrimination against the larger family with a moderate income, in so far as those with higher incomes and fewer children are protected by the minimum grant arrangements.</quote>
<quote>"Under the new formula for the calculation of parental contribution, our assessment has been increased by a factor of 250 per cent. from around &#x00A3;1,000 in the three previous years to above &#x00A3;2,500 for 1984&#x2013;85 with the same number of children at university."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01525">The third change is in the amount of the minimum award. Further evidence of the imposition of a backdoor tax upon parents has been the introduction this year of a reduction in the minimum award. This
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0149"/>
<col>281</col>
has been halved, reduced from &#x00A3;410 to &#x00A3;205, with parents being asked to make up the shortfall. Not only is this a blow to the degree to which students can be independent from their parents, but it is a severe blow to the significant number of students whose parents refuse to complete the necessary assessment forms and refuse to make up the parental contribution. The 1982&#x2013;83 survey showed that only just over half the parents paid their assessed contribution and 12 per cent. of students received over &#x00A3;200 less than could be expected.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01526">There is evidence of a good deal of borrowing from banks and of overdrafts. The same survey shows that 56 per cent. of students had overdrafts at some point in their courses and that 33 per cent. ended their last term overdrawn. Loans, in fact, are coming in by the backdoor, too.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01527">Students who would like to be independent are finding it increasingly difficult, with the present unemployment situation, to get vacational jobs. Some students manage to find work in term time, but that is not satisfactory for their academic work, particularly when, as in some cases, 20 hours per week were being put in. There have been rumours that the halving of the minimum grant this year is the first step to its abolition next year. When the Minister replies, will he reassure us that this is not so and that the parental contribution scale will not demand even more of parents next year.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01528">Thus, there is a cumulative effect from these changes to the regulations. The impact will be profound for both students and parents. In discussions with the National Union of Students, Mr. Peter Brooke gave a commitment to monitor the effects of the new regulations on travel costs. We want to ask the Minister how the monitoring is to take place and when a report will be forthcoming.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01529">These three substantial changes in the regulations this academic year have been made without the benefit of any hard evidence from the Government. The only information available on travel costs was collected in Scotland and, as a result of this information, the Scottish Office decided against following the example of the DES and has retained the old reimbursement system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01530">The National Union of Students, on the other hand, has collected and presented in three major forms information which shows the current climate for students whose resources are coming under attack from all quarters. In the last year the NUS has published its annual local education awards survey, its accommodation costs survey, and its independently conducted income and expenditure survey. The Secretary of State has copies of all these documents.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01531">Mr. Peter Brooke, at a meeting with the NUS president and officials on 28th September last, said that he accepted the information on travel produced by the NUS as correct to within 10 per cent.&#x2014;which is the normal margin of error in statistical calculations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01532">In the last five years since the Government came to power the student grant has declined in real terms by some 10 per cent. Indeed, with the abolition of the system of reimbursing excess travel expenditure for many students there will be a much greater decline in the value of their grant. During the same period, due
<col>282</col>
to the financial constraints placed upon the higher educational establishments, there has been an increase in real terms in costs for accommodation. Accommodation and food now account for approximately 75 per cent. of annual income, as against 62 per cent. in 1979.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01533">The NUS is due shortly to present its annual submission to the DES concerning the grant regulations for 1985&#x2013;86. The main point of the claim will be an education allowance for all 16-to 19-year-olds; a minimum allowance for all post-16 students which would provide parity with the allowance for young people on the youth training scheme&#x2014;&#x00A3;30 a week is proposed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01534">In the EEC report on youth training, debated in this House last Monday, one of the recommendations was that this age group should have a common status and income. I very much hope that that will be accepted by the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01535">The NUS is asking for a 14 per cent. increase in the main rate of grant to restore its real value to the 1979 value. On travel, it is proposing a return to the reimbursement system, but with three different fixed elements within the main rate in order to ease the administrative burden on the LEAs, which we admit was heavy and which, one presumes, was a major reason for the change. It is suggested that the minimum grant should be &#x00A3;1,200, reflecting the claim of a minimum of &#x00A3;30 per week over a 40-week period, excluding the summer vacation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01536">In the debate on higher education on 14th March this year in this House I urged the Government to review the whole system of both student mandatory awards and the present 16&#x2013;19 tangle. This will require cross-departmental co-operation between the DES, the Department of Employment and the Department of Health and Social Security. I was cheered to hear the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, in the debate last Monday say that he was chairing a committee composed of junior Ministers and senior officials from those departments and from the Department of Trade and Industry. I hope very much that that committee will look at this whole grant question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01537">It is now nearly a quarter of a century since the publication of the Anderson report on the grant system on which our present system is based. It is high time for a new look.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01538">I hope that the review will take evidence from both Government departments and relevant nongovernmental bodies, with the results being made public at the earliest opportunity. The National Advisory Body in its <i>Strategy for Higher Education in the Late 1980s and Beyond,</i> at page 37 in the section on student support says, in paragraph 8.43:
<quote>"We therefore urge that the DES should institute a major review of the system of fees and of student support with the declared objective of identifying ways in which both might be adjusted to increase access and encourage student demand in the light of our recommended priorities".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01539">There was feeling all round that a change is very much overdue.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01540">Can we have some commitment from the Government that this review will take place? Can we have an absolute assurance that there will be a
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0150"/>
<col>283</col>
monitoring of the effect of these very important and major changes to the award regulations in 1984&#x2013;85, which we believe will cause great difficulties for a great many students in higher education in this country? I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01541">Moved, That an Humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the Regulations [S.I. 1984 No. 1116], laid before the House on 1st August 1984, be annulled&#x2014;(<i>Baroness David</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01542">3.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01543"><member>Lord Kilmarnock</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House is indebted to the noble Baroness for praying against these regulations and thus giving us the opportunity for this short debate. The noble Baroness has made most, if not all, of the points which arise from the regulations. I want to concentrate on one area&#x2014;books. It is manifestly obvious that courses cannot be pursued without the proper material, of which books are by far the most important. There is, as I understand it, no notional sum built into the grant for books in the same way as the basic &#x00A3;50 for travel. Since 1963 the value of the maintenance grants has been steadily eroded. Yet more and more students are being forced to use part of their maintenance money on buying books as a result of the enforced cutbacks in library purchases.<lb/>
If a small group of, say, six or seven, has to queue for the only library copy of an essential book for the course, it is obvious that those at the tail of the queue will be forced to buy it if they are to pursue their course competently and conscientiously. Even if there are five copies for a course of 20 students, the same thing may happen.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge raised this whole question in a very trenchant speech which he made on his own Unstarred Question on 24th March 1983 when he gave the figures on university library purchases as they were at that time. Since then more recent statistics have become available, and, judging from a report from the National Book League on library book spending in universities, polytechnics and colleges between 1978 and 1982, there is no reason to think that the experience has been any better since. There are two passages that I should like to quote. The first is this:
<quote>"In the 1978&#x2013;79 academic year, the average expenditure on books and periodicals per student (full-time equivalent) in the UK's 53 university and university college libraries was &#x00A3;57.50. Four years later, in 1981&#x2013;82, the figure for average expenditure on books and periodicals had risen by 20 per cent. to &#x00A3;69.06. During that period, however, the retail price index for books rose by 53 per cent. and a comparable index for periodicals (Blackwells) by 45 per cent. All this amounts to an <i>effective reduction in real expenditure of books and periodicals of over 19 per cent. per full-time equivalent student."</i></quote>
It also appears to be the case from this report that at only seven of the 53 institutions that I have mentioned did bookspending rise to keep up with inflation and at six universities real expenditure on books actually fell by half over those four years.<lb/>
It is clear that some types of course require more books than others. A student on a scientific course may be able specifically to work with perhaps a single text book for a short time but a history student who is covering his period in depth obviously will need a considerable array of reading matter. It is also clear that the slender financial resources of students cannot
<col>284</col>
be expected to make good the deficiencies of provision in their libraries' book stocks.<lb/>
There is one further point on books which I should like to raise with the noble Earl. There have been some very ugly rumours circulated in the press recently that the Government plan to impose VAT on books. This would make the situation even worse, and certainly would lead to demands from universities to reimburse them for their VAT costs and therefore the imposition of VAT would be counter-productive. It would in fact be pointless. But even if the Government did that, the individual student would still be faced with an even higher cost for his or her own individual book purchases. I hope very much that the noble Earl will be able to assure us this afternoon that the Government have no such intention and that the press reports are mischievous and wrong.<lb/>
Before I sit down I should like to ask the noble Earl what the Government consider they are achieving by their constant erosion of the educational potential of this country. We understand perfectly the search for a new relevance. We do not think that all the Government's initiatives have been bad. The new 14-to-18 year old technical and vocational scheme is clearly an important experiment. The introduction of the new AS-level to run in tandem with A-level is to be welcomed. It appears in fact to be a version of the I-level scheme put forward by the now defunct Schools Council, which we have been advocating for several years. We do not believe that the MSC is the devil incarnate running roughshod over the educational establishment, and we do not believe that any purpose is served by a civil war between the trainers and the educators.<lb/>
But we do think that the constant snipping and squeezing of lifelines to the mainstream educational system is, to say the very least, shortsighted. However much you train, however much you persuade industry to put into training and however shrewdly you try to select the topics and disciplines most relevant to the future, you cannot possibly manage to predict future requirements in job-specific skills or the balance between one industry and another, for example, 10 years from now, with any great exactness. What you can say&#x2014;and I believe that most employers would support this&#x2014;is the formation of a whole person able to cope with and adapt to the shifting demands of the labour market and the needs of society very much depends on the general education service&#x2014;nursery, primary, secondary, further and higher&#x2014;of this country.<lb/>
It is folly to underfund that service and to seize on falling rolls as an excuse for indiscriminate cuts rather than taking the opportunity of long-overdue improvements. It is folly to introduce, as these regulations do, travel regulations which make it more difficult for students to get to the universities where they have been offered a place which is suitable for their abilities. It is folly to impose cuts which make it impossible for university and other libraries to buy enough books for their students, and it is folly to erode maintenance grants to the extent that students who are forced to buy books as the result of the library cuts are unable to do so. Incidentally, it is also bad for the United Kingdom publishing industry.<lb/>

Finally, it is my hope that the Government will take seriously what has been said and what is yet to be said here this evening and that they will recognise that some of this relentless pressure on our universities and their students can be nothing but damaging in the long run to the efficiency and prosperity of the country.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01545"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would join with the noble Lord in congratulating my noble friend Lady David for giving us the opportunity for debating what in my opinion is a very important subject&#x2014;not only the actual problems of the grants but the consequences that are likely to follow from the way things are going within this field. Before commenting briefly on some of the points that my noble friend Lady David made&#x2014;because, as the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, said, she has covered the ground extremely well&#x2014;I should like to endorse what Lord Kilmarnock said about the cost of books. It was my good fortune to have as tutor in politics two distinguished Members of your Lordships' House but I would not want to hold either of them responsible (or for your Lordships to hold them responsible) for what has happened subsequently in my political career. One of them said: "Of course, the object of reading PPE (philosophy, politics and economics) at Oxford is that you do not really learn anything about the subject but you should have a very good acquaintanceship with the bibliography over the field".<lb/>
Recollecting the length of the book list that I was given at that time, I suspect that at present it would take the whole of one's grant to buy them and there would be nothing left for any other purpose at all; because it is not only the case that books have risen very much more on average than the cost of living and statistics that have gone into the compilation of grants, but also libraries have been cut back. A lot of universities trying to maintain other aspects of their work have cut back on library provision. I have heard this from many quarters. It is extremely difficult even for the students to borrow the books. As the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, has said, there is a great distinction between students in a perhaps more practical field of study where they spend a good deal more time in laboratories and lectures than in some other subjects where it is desirable that they should have a wide acquaintance with the literature involved.<lb/>
Quite apart from the actual books for study, one of the advantages I always feel of the university is that it is one time when people can read, and should be encouraged to read, outside their own subject. Indeed, with the pressures now under the present grants applying to students, I doubt very much if they would have the funds even to buy paper-back books of a very wide kind; and on the few occasions that I have recently stayed in college rooms, I have noticed that the students' libraries are a lot thinner and smaller than they used to be some years ago.<lb/>
I think that the worst feature of the present grant system is the way that the Government have gone back on all the commitments that they made prior to becoming the Government and all the things that they said to me and to my predecessors about the way the
<col>286</col>
grant system was devised. I do not think that anybody who voted Conservative in 1979 expected for example that the parental contribution would change from 22 per cent. in 1979 of the total cost of student maintenance to 39 per cent. in 1984, with all the likelihood of that figure increasing. Indeed, I am told by the results of research that over the same period between 1981 and 1984 the parental contributions in total have gone up by 117 per cent. and the public fund provision for student maintenance has gone down by 5 per cent. I do not somehow seem to have read anything about this in the Conservative Manifesto for either the last election or the one before. One of my noble friends says, "Maybe it will be in the next one"&#x2014;but I have a feeling that this will be something which is only in the small print. While we have to accept that there is a parental responsibility and that parents should provide, we are not living in the general economic circumstances when parental incomes in real terms are increasing. Indeed, in many families it is the very reverse.<lb/>
I endorse what my noble friend Lady David has said about the need for a complete look at the whole question of the grants system, apart from these student cuts. I believe that the current grant, depending on how much is allowed for travel in view of the changed practice of which my noble friend spoke, has dropped about 10 per cent. in real terms since 1979. The noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, referred to the matter of books; and we know that in one or two other fields of expenditure, such as when students have to eat out, or live in college and university institutions, charges have gone up, I would suspect, rather more than the average annual increase in the retail price index. So I think there has been a reduction in the real income available to students even if their parents have paid their full contribution; although of course in many cases they do not.<lb/>
What will be a very real problem for many students is the reduction in the minimum grant from &#x00A3;410 to &#x00A3;205. There has been speculation recently that this will be reduced further, or even abolished altogether. We shall be most anxious to learn from the noble Earl when he comes to reply what assurances he can give on this point&#x2014;namely, that there is no intention to reduce the minimum grant still further. The minimum grant, of course, goes to wealthy parents. I am sorry to say that it is some of the wealthiest parents who are the least generous in the provision that they make for their sons' and daughters' education. It may be that there are differences of view about whether they should or should not go to university and so on. But I have come across quite a number of students whose parents could certainly have paid the whole cost of the education with no great hardship, but in fact they gave their children very little or nothing, so that they had to depend&#x2014;and it is increasingly difficult now&#x2014;on finding work during the vacations to supplement the minimum grant to which they were entitled.<lb/>
I hope therefore that we can get some guidance from the noble Earl that these matters are being taken very seriously by his right honourable friend the Secretary of State, who I know is a man with a very real interest in education and young people. I would hope that we could have an assurance that the submission which
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0152"/>
<col>287</col>
was sent only last week by the National Union of Students to the department will be given the most serious consideration.<lb/>
I will not weary your Lordships by going into the details of the very substantial facts that the National Union of Students have put together about the whole set of problems they face, but it seems to me to be a serious submission based on research and real facts which we do not have in support of the regulations currently before us and I would like to be given an assurance that serious attention will be given to this submission. I see that it was sent only on Monday of this week by the students to the department. Of course, we would not expect an answer to all the points this afternoon, but I am sure that some assurance will be appreciated.<lb/>
Finally&#x2014;and I will be brief because I have raised this matter before in your Lordships' House and in a sense it is not directly relevant to the particular problems of our national students&#x2014;I would hope there could be another look at the definition that is applied as to who is a "home" and who is an "overseas" student, because one hears of some very hard cases: for example, soldiers who have served continuously in Germany have found that their children are denied grants. As I say, I hope another look can be given at the definitions, on the one hand, and also at the whole question of the enormous differential between home and overseas students in the matter of fees.<lb/>
I think that this differential is one of the most stupid and narrow things that have ever been done. I admit it was started in a tiny way by my own Government&#x2014;but not by me. I knew that once a differential was opened up it would get wider and wider. The situation now is that very few students who used to come to this country are coming. They are going to universities in France, Germany or other continental countries, or to the United States.<lb/>
In the longer run we are going to lose the business that has often come in the past, because when students who have been educated here as young men become leaders in their own countries, their contacts are here and they tend to look to English magazines and English firms for their supply. In fact, I met a Greek friend this very week who asked me if I could get him a report of Marks and Spencer's&#x2014;he is in the retail trade. He said, "I want to take it back because my nephew will never read anything about Britain because he was educated in the United States: all he looks to for information are journals from the United States".<lb/>
Loss of business is bound to happen, particularly in higher technology, engineering and so on, if we make education virtually impossible&#x2014;as in many cases it has been made impossible&#x2014;by this very high level of fees we are charging, not only for undergraduate but more particularly for postgraduate studies. I would hope that this could be looked at again in the context of the review of the financing of universities, for which I thought that my noble friend Lady David made a very strong case. I hope that we can have some information from the Minister which will give us a little encouragement, although I know it is not your Lordships' practice to vote in favour of a Motion such as that on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01546">3.58 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01547"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish very briefly to intervene and I apologise for not having put my name down on the list and given the Minister notice. My noble friend Lord Glenamara has on more than one occasion during the current year raised on the Floor of the House the special problems of the students at Newcastle Polytechnic. In his unavoidable absence today&#x2014;he would have liked to be here&#x2014;I shall raise some points that he would have wished to make in the debate, upon which I should be very grateful if the Minister could perhaps reply to my noble friend direct. My noble friend will certainly be reading <i>Hansard</i>.<lb/>
May I begin by paying a warm tribute to the very able way in which my noble friend Lady David has encompassed the three main concerns, and not just that of the student body. I think we have to be quite clear that, although students are at the sharp end of the punishment which is the net result of these changes, it is not only students but also communities and parents, and ultimately our nation, who are going to be damaged.<lb/>
I want to give one or two illustrations to the Minister which I hope he and his advisers will take away and reflect upon. Great play has been made by the Minister about consultations that took place before the regulations were conceived and laid. He knows of the very strong reaction to the meaningless way in which those consultations took place and we now have, as my noble friend Lord Mulley said, some pretty hard evidence about the dire consequences of the situation.<lb/>
I want to give the House some illustrations which my noble friend Lord Glenamara has given to me and which were given to him by the Newcastle Polytechnic. Let us consider this primarily in respect of the impact of the changes in the travel award. There is the case of a second-year student who is undertaking a BA government and public policy course. The cost of public transport from his home will be &#x00A3;296&#x00B7;80. The remarks column of this document states that he is a mature student with a family. If he moved to Newcastle he would claim a two-homes grant of up to &#x00A3;590, but his family life would be severely disrupted. The calculations exclude vacation journeys to the polytechnic library.<lb/>
I have here another case of a student doing a BSc in mechanical engineering and he, too, is a second-year student. If this student used public transport it would cost &#x00A3;400 and his working day would be from 6.30 a.m. to 7 p.m. He would have to move to Newcastle and claim the higher grant. In the case of another student in his first year undertaking a course for a BA in accountancy, his public transport costs are &#x00A3;300. He would have to move to Newcastle and would claim the higher grant. Another student in the first year of a BA business studies course has public transport costs of &#x00A3;550. This student's wife works in the home town. He would not be able to continue his course.<lb/>
Another BSc student in the second year of a course in mechanical engineering has public transport costs of &#x00A3;414. I ask your Lordships to bear in mind that this is against the grant of &#x00A3;110. This is based on the &#x00A3;160 limit. This married mature student would lose &#x00A3;7 a week and could continue on his course only with a considerable reduction in living standards. He could
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0153"/>
<col>289</col>
not really consider a second home in Newcastle. Those are some illustrations.<lb/>
It may very well be that the Minister and his advisers are not aware of them, but if they are aware of them it is no good the Minister saying that there are swings and roundabouts and that most students will benefit. If you are one of the students whom I have listed, no matter who else benefits and by how much, such a change will have very serious consequences. I should like to tell the Minister what I am told by the Newcastle Polytechnic is likely to happen in those situations. Many students will move to Newcastle and claim the living away from home grant, costing the local authority an additional &#x00A3;385, which I am sure the Minister would not want. Alternatively, they will claim a two homes grant of up to &#x00A3;390 or will leave their courses midway, wasting not only their own considerable effort, commitment and skills, but also the LEA money.<lb/>
I simply say to the Minister that, if what he has been setting out is a more equitable means of using a limited sum of public money, surely individuals who are as hard-pressed as students undertaking a course ought not to undergo any worsening of their existing position. I am not talking about feather-bedding or public largesse. I am talking about a group of people who, by and large, are not having it very easy. Is the Minister setting out to create some kind of obstacle course over which the dedicated, committed student has to jump until, finally, he becomes qualified and better able to lead our nation?<lb/>
The Minister has an opportunity in this debate to make some reassuring noises and statements and if he will undertake to look very carefully at hardship&#x2014;and it ought not to be too much of a hardship for him to do that&#x2014;and will say something that is helpful either to local authorities or to students who are placed in an impossible situation, then I will be very grateful and I know that my noble friend Lord Glenamara will be grateful too.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01548">4.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01549"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that we are all grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady David, for raising in this place an important area of education policy and one which we have not for some time had the opportunity to discuss as fully as we have today. May I first apologise for the delay which the noble Baroness quite rightly mentioned at the beginning of her speech. I shall try to explain the reasons why these mandatory grants regulations were not laid before Parliament until the last minute.<lb/>
They are dependent upon the supplementary allowances. The supplementary allowances cannot be calculated until the DHSS rates of supplementary benefit are published and, in fact, it was not until mid-June that the supplementary benefit rates became available this year. However, there was some improvement in the 1984 timetable for the announcement of the supplementary allowances. This occurred because the link with the DHSS rates was broken in the case of certain important allowances, including that for extra weeks of study, making it possible to announce them as part of the 16th April package.<lb/>
<col>290</col>
In fact, the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1984 were formally laid before Parliament on 1st August 1984, and this was an improvement on last year, when the equivalent regulations were laid on 9th August 1983. Of course, I acknowledge and accept that the date of our rising for the Summer Recess was not a great deal of help. We cannot, I am afraid, give a commitment for next year, except to say that we will do our very best. But I am, of course, particularly grateful to the noble Baroness for giving me an opportunity to explain to noble Lords the Government's record in this key area since we came into office.<lb/>
The system of mandatory awards which we are discussing today came into operation in 1962, following the report of a committee of inquiry established by the then Minister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland under the chairmanship of Sir Colin Anderson. Previously students did not enjoy a statutory right to maintenance support. But as a result of the Anderson report, this assistance was granted to them by a Conservative Government as part of the Education Act 1962, and it is a privilege that they still enjoy today.<lb/>
Since the Anderson Committee reported, successive Governments have continued to give effect to the principles set out in the report and this Government are no exception. In a period when the Government have sought to reduce public spending over a wide range of areas as part of their general economic strategy, they have continued to find the resources necessary to maintain the mandatory awards scheme. Indeed, more students benefit now from public support through the awards system than ever before. Since we came into office, the number of full value award holders has risen from 369,400 to the 439,500 we estimate this year&#x2014;an increase of almost one-fifth.<lb/>
This is hardly the erosion of our education system to which the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, referred in his speech. May I say to him on books, since I have mentioned his name, that there is in fact a notional sum within the grant for books. But the NUS survey evidence, which has been brought to our attention by all speakers this afternoon, suggests that the students spend that sum not on books, but on other things.<lb/>
So far as VAT on books is concerned, the Government are committed to shifting the burden of taxation from taxes on earnings to taxes on spending. This means that the indirect tax base may have to be further extended so that income tax can be further reduced. But the Government have no set views at present on how this might best be done.<lb/>
Furthermore, our awards system is extremely generous and is regarded with envy by many overseas. No other country in the western world provides statutory grant support at the level we do&#x2014;and for such a wide range of students. This year total public expenditure on fees and maintenance is forecast to be some &#x00A3;706 million. Most other western countries include a loans element in one form or another in their student support arrangements, but here students receive the majority of their maintenance support by means of a non-repayable grant. No wonder, then, that students abroad, as the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, said, look enviously at the British award system and seek, where they can, to take advantage of it.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0154"/>
<col>291</col>
It is of course very easy for noble Lords sitting on the Benches opposite to say that we have not done enough, or that we have not been generous enough, or for them to concentrate on one or two areas where they believe the Government have not been as generous as they should have been, or as they would have been. But I am sure that noble Lords on all sides of the House will take note of what the Government have done under the very real constraints under which they must work&#x2014;constraints which of course do not apply to noble Lords opposite.<lb/>
I should now like to say a little about each of the changes introduced under the regulations which we are debating today. I shall start, naturally enough, with grant rates. These, as we have heard, have been increased by 4 per cent. That increase represents, as it has always done in the past, a compromise between students' aspirations, their needs and the total sum it is reasonable to expect taxpayers and ratepayers to provide for the maintenance support of a privileged group of young people, many of whom will go on to earn enhanced salaries after graduation as a result of their publicly funded studies. I appreciate that the increase was not as generous as some students and their representatives would have liked, though I am sure that very many students appreciate that the taxpayer&#x2014;including of course their own parents&#x2014;does not have a bottomless purse and that this year's settlement is reasonable. Moreover, I am sure that students understand that they, in common with other groups in our society, cannot expect to be insulated from the harsh economic realities of life.<lb/>
Given our success in reducing the rate of inflation, then, this year's settlement is I believe a fair one&#x2014;for students, whose needs should continue to be met for the period which the grant covers, and for parents and for taxpayers and ratepayers who foot most of the bill.<lb/>
Turning now to parental contributions, again the Government have sought to provide a fair settlement. First, the parental contributions scale has been indexed so that about the same number of parents will be assessed for a contribution this year as last. We have also sought to protect families earning less than around the average income from the real increases resulting from the steeper scale we have introduced. We have done this by retaining the lower part of the scale at its previous rate. We have, however, chosen to steepen the slope of the scale for families earning more than average income, thereby increasing their parental contribution in real terms.<lb/>
Ministers have also decided to halve the minimum award from &#x00A3;410 to &#x00A3;205. At this point I should like to satisfy both the noble Baroness, Lady David, and the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, by denying categorically that any decision has yet been taken to reduce the award of &#x00A3;205 for next year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01550"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister convey to his right honourable friend the point that we should very strongly object if further consideration of the award meant that it was to be reduced?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01551"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall certainly do that. I regret that this story has appeared in some sections of the press. So far as I know, there is absolutely no truth in it. Ministers also appreciate that
<col>292</col>
this decision has led to unease on both sides of the House, but they have concluded that it would not be equitable to insulate higher income families from increased contributions when larger contributions would be assessed from parents whose incomes are lower.<lb/>
I am sure noble Lords will appreciate that these decisions were not taken lightly. The savings resulting from this measure form part of a package which was necessary to keep public spending within the limits we had set. Faced with the need to make savings in higher education, Ministers&#x2014;unlike noble Lords opposite&#x2014;had to decide where savings should be made. They judged it preferable to make these savings on student awards rather than in other areas; for example, in the provision for the universities or for science.<lb/>
Ministers were also faced with the equally difficult decision of how to achieve those savings. One possibility would have been to have kept down the main rate of grant. Ministers rejected this option because it would have been regressive and hit students from least well off backgrounds hardest&#x2014;I am sure that this is something which appeals to noble Lords on the other side of the House&#x2014;and because it would have run counter to the Government's general policy of encouraging wider access to higher education from all social groups. Ministers therefore concluded that the most equitable way forward would be to introduce the new scales incorporated into the regulations we are debating. I commend this difficult decision to noble Lords.<lb/>
We have heard that these changes will result in more students suffering hardship, due to their parents' failure to make up their assessed parental contribution in full. This is a point which the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, made very forcefully. At this stage this is merely conjecture, but I urge all parents&#x2014;as Ministers of successive Governments have done&#x2014;to make up their assessed contributions in full. They should not overlook the help which deeds of covenant can offer in this respect.<lb/>
Ministers were pleased to learn from the NUS survey that non-payment of assessed parental contribution is a less widespead problem now than it was a decade ago and they hope that this trend will continue. But this certainly does not mean that Ministers&#x2014;in particular my right honourable friend&#x2014;are complacent. I hope that publicity will be drawn to this point and to the fact that parents should pay their contributions in full. But it would be idle to pretend that the Government could solve the problem altogether by simply abolishing the parental contribution system. We estimate that the cost of doing this would be some &#x00A3;250 million per annum. It would therefore not be possible to contemplate abolition now or in the foreseeable future, just as it has not been possible for successive Governments to contemplate it in the past.<lb/>
I now turn to the new arrangements which we have introduced to deal with students' travel and which have taken up a large part of our debate this afternoon. I recall, of course, that these proposals were criticised by several of your Lordships earlier in the year. I responded to those criticisms at that time and I remain convinced now that the changes which we have made are right.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0155"/>
<col>293</col>
The former method, under which students were able to claim reimbursement of expenditure which they had incurred in travelling to and from their place of study, was administratively cumbersome and inefficient and therefore inherently expensive. It gave no incentive to students to seek the most economical way to travel, as they knew that the taxpayer would ultimately foot the bill. Furthermore, the old arrangements implied an open-ended commitment to public expenditure and to a significant amount of public spending. Noble Lords may care to note that this year the department will be spending some &#x00A3;39 million on students' travel&#x2014;not an inconsiderable sum.<lb/>
I am sure that noble Lords who have spoken so eloquently on the new arrangements hold no brief for an inefficient and expensive system. I am sure, too, that they would agree that the Government must guard the taxpayers' interests and ensure that public money is disbursed as wisely as possible and that this area of expenditure should be kept under as close control as is possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01552"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that this House would not countenance administrative inconvenience. I am also sure that the House accepts that this was one of the prime reasons for the change in the system by the Government. If, however, one of the consequences of the change is to cause the kind of hardship which I have illustrated, the Government must surely recognise that change for purely administrative convenience may drive away good students from universities or, as my noble friend Lady David pointed out, induce students to look more closely at universities which are nearer to where they live, though they may not be the right universities for the kind of studies they wish to pursue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01553"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, will bear with me for a minute, I hope to be able to offer a fairly satisfactory answer to his question. Inevitably any change in the system of reimbursing actual cost to a more broadly based approach will mean that while some students will gain, others will lose. Ministers understood and acknowledged this when they first put forward their revised proposals, but they were aware, too, that very many more students would gain under the new proposals&#x2014;by the increase in the grants to which I have referred&#x2014;than would lose.<lb/>
Some 56 per cent. of full value award holders&#x2014;around 235,000 students&#x2014;made no claim for excess travel reimbursement in 1982&#x2013;83, the latest year for which we have data. All of these students will gain either &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;110 under the new arrangements, depending upon whether or not they live with their parents. Those claiming less than &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;110 respectively will gain, too, reducing the number of losers still further.<lb/>
Ministers were also concerned that the interests of particular groups of claimants whose travel requirements could not be easily catered for under a nonreimbursement system were protected. Special provision has therefore been made for those studying abroad or away from the main place of study and, I am glad to say&#x2014;for noble Lords will know that this is a
<col>294</col>
subject very close to my own heart&#x2014;for the disabled. Furthermore, in response to the representations made to them during the consultative period earlier this year, Ministers have made special arrangements for those who were on courses before 1st September this year and who face unavoidably very high travelling expenses. So, while I accept that some students will be made worse off under the new arrangements, again the effect of the change must be viewed in its proper perspective.<lb/>
A number of noble Lords have spoken forcefully both today and before the Recess about students whom they expect to be made worse off and about particular local problems of which they have specialist knowledge. Here I would say that nobody has made these points more forcibly than the noble Lord, Lord Glenamara, and, in his absence, the noble Lord, Lord Graham.<lb/>
Ministers acknowledge that some students will find themselves worse off than they are now if they continue with their existing travel arrangements&#x2014;though one of the aims of the new system is to encourage students to seek the most cost-effective means of travel, where they have not done so in the past. Ministers understand, too, that in some cases the scope available to students to change their travel patterns may be limited. But they believe that in many of the cases which have been put to them students will be able to find solutions which will reduce their present levels of travel spending and not leave them significantly worse off than they were before.<lb/>
Noble Lords will understand, I am sure, that it would not be sensible to try to tackle local problems, if they do indeed arise&#x2014;and I am sure they do&#x2014;by an across-the-board increase in the provision for travel. That would involve an enormous deadweight cost and would be an inefficient way to disburse taxpayers' and ratepayers' money. They will understand, too, I am sure, Ministers' natural reluctance to contemplate any change which would make the present regulations more complex than they are already, or would make the job of local education authorities more difficult in administering those regulations. Indeed, that would run counter to one of the main reasons for the changes we have made; administrative simplicity.<lb/>
It is also reasonable, before considering whether any further amendments to the arrangements are necessary, to give students sufficient time to adapt to the new arrangements, and the new system a chance to settle down. In addition, of course, any changes introduced for the benefit of any one particular group could only be made at the expense of others.<lb/>
For all these reasons, then, Ministers will be reluctant to contemplate any immediate change in the present system, but I can say&#x2014;and here I hope that I can bring words of comfort to the noble Lord, Lord Graham, and others&#x2014;that if, once the new system has had a chance to settle, Ministers are presented with compelling evidence that some students are facing hardship as a result of the new arrangements and a means is available to overcome any such problems in an administratively efficient way, they will look at them again. That, I am sure all noble Lords will acknowledge, is reasonable, sensible and generous.<lb/>

I turn now to the three other improvements made in this year's regulations, which are important and about which&#x2014;perhaps not surprisingly&#x2014;we have heard nothing this afternoon. Ministers have listened sympathetically to the case made&#x2014;particularly by medical students, but of course applying to all students in both universities and the public sector who study on longer courses&#x2014;for an increase in the allowance for extra weeks of study. While they do not accept that the weekly rate of grant for extra weeks should be equivalent to the average weekly value of the award, Ministers decided that, in addition to a 4 per cent. increase in line with main rates of grant and the incorporation of an amount <i>pro rata</i> to the new flat rate travel provision, the extra weeks' allowance should be increased. A significant real increase of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;80 per week is therefore incorporated into the regulations.<lb/>
Ministers have also listened sympathetically to representations that all periods when a student was either in, or available for, work should be counted for the purposes of establishing independent status under the awards regulations. The regulations before us today have therefore been amended to give effect to this.<lb/>
Finally, the regulations have been amended significantly to increase the sum a student may receive by way of sponsorship from his employer or prospective employer without losing grant. Indeed, the allowance has been more than doubled from &#x00A3;540 per annum to &#x00A3;1,200, and for students under the National Engineering Scholarship there is an even larger increase&#x2014;from &#x00A3;795 to &#x00A3;1,500. Students may now receive a total of &#x00A3;1,600&#x2014;or for National Engineering Scholarship students &#x00A3;1,900&#x2014;by way of sponsorship and other income before their grant is affected. It is to be hoped that these increased sponsorship levels will help to attract able students to courses related to the wealth-creating parts of our economy&#x2014;including courses leading to careers in vital new technologies.<lb/>
My Lords, in conclusion, I commend the Education (Mandatory Awards) Regulations 1984 to you.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01554"><member>Baroness David</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate. I was particularly glad that the noble Lord, Lord Kilmarnock, mentioned books and the threat of VAT; but I am not so reassured by what the Minister had to say on that subject. I thank the noble Earl for his spirited defence of the regulations and for saying that the Government will pay attention if there is evidence of real hardship.<lb/>
The Minister did not really answer my question about monitoring, but we hope that there will be monitoring and some research into how these new regulations affect students; that is very important. And, although one can congratulate the Government on having more students at the higher education level, that is partly because there are more in that age group at the moment. But it is not much use their being there unless they have the wherewithal to make a really profitable thing of their three years in higher education, and we fear that that may not happen under these new regulations. I particularly hope that the travel arrangements will be thoroughly monitored.<lb/>
<col>296</col>
The Minister did not say whether there will be any review of the whole grant system. This is one of the most important points of all. But we have had an opportunity to have a good discussion on the new regulations&#x2014;and we have not discussed regulations for some time&#x2014;and I look forward to having the regulations before us rather sooner next year, so that we may debate them before they come into force. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.<lb/>

<title>Hong Kong Agreement</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01555">4.26 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01556"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your Lordships' permission, I should like to repeat a Statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary about developments during the Recess in the negotiations between the British and Chinese Governments on the future of Hong Kong. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"During my discussions in Peking with Chinese leaders in late July, I was able to resolve most of the major issues outstanding in the negotiations. I gave a progress report in a statement in Hong Kong on 1st August: copies of that statement were placed in the Library of the House on the same day.<lb/>
"Negotiations continued on the remaining unresolved issues and were brought to a successful conclusion on 22nd September. As a result, a draft agreement, consisting of a joint declaration and three annexes, was initialled on 26th September by the British Ambassador in Peking and the Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zhou Nan. It was published on the same day in a White Paper in London and Hong Kong and laid before the House.<lb/>
"I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following important features of the draft agreement:<lb/>
"It constitutes a formal international agreement, legally binding in all its parts. This is the highest form of commitment that can be given by one sovereign state to another;<lb/>
"It deals in considerable detail with Chinese policies towards Hong Kong after 1997, and thus provides a framework in which the people of Hong Kong can plan and work for a secure and prosperous future;<lb/>
"It thus provides for Hong Kong's distinctive economic and social systems, freedoms and lifestyle to continue unchanged;<lb/>
"It makes clear that the policies which it spells out for Hong Kong will be stipulated in a Basic Law to be passed by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and will remain unchanged for 50 years after 1997.<lb/>
"It is now for the people of Hong Kong to give their views on the draft agreement. The House has already been informed of the arrangements which have been made to enable them to do so. Over 2 million copies of the White Paper have been distributed in the territory.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0157"/>
<col>297</col>
"I am very glad to be able to tell the House that the Executive Council of Hong Kong has felt able to recommend the draft agreement to the people of Hong Kong&#x2014;in the words of the senior unofficial member&#x2014;'in good conscience'.<lb/>
"The House will also wish to know that, at the conclusion of their debate last week, the Hong Kong Legislative Council gave the draft agreement their overwhelming support and similarly commended it to the people of Hong Kong.<lb/>
"Beyond that, I have been encouraged by the favourable reactions which have come from many other public bodies and individuals in Hong Kong and by the wide international welcome it has received.<lb/>
"The House will in due course wish to know the extent to which the draft agreement as a whole is acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. It was made quite clear in the White Paper that the draft agreement itself cannot be amended. But the views expressed in Hong Kong on all parts of it will be of value in our continuing discussions with the Chinese, particularly in the Joint Liaison Group. I am sure the House would wish me to urge everyone in Hong Kong to submit their views on all these aspects to the Assessment Office.<lb/>
"The report of the Assessment Office, together with that of the monitoring team, will be published at about the end of November. The House will of course attach great importance to these reports when it debates the draft agreement, and I know that my right honourable friend will be seeking to give the House an early opportunity to debate the matter after the publication of these reports.<lb/>
"It would not be right to anticipate that debate. But the Government have made quite clear their own view that the draft agreement provides the assurances which are necessary if the people of Hong Kong are to face the future with confidence. In the words of the White Paper: 'Her Majesty's Government believe that the Agreement is a good one. They strongly commend it to the people of Hong Kong and to Parliament.' "<lb/>
My Lords, that is the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01557"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord for repeating the Statement. Having studied the draft agreement and its annexes and heard the Statement, I should like at once on behalf of my noble friends to congratulate the Foreign Secretary, and all those who were concerned in the long, complicated and hard negotiations which have taken place, on bringing them to a successful conclusion.<lb/>
It was clear from the start&#x2014;was it not?&#x2014;that after 1997, when the lease of most of the colony expires, the Chinese Government were not prepared to allow the <i>status quo</i> to continue and that the peaceful and successful future of the colony depended upon agreement being reached between China and ourselves. In the event, I believe that in the circumstances, provided the terms of the agreement and annexes are carried out, there are good prospects of achieving this.<lb/>
<col>298</col>
The first of the important features of the draft agreement to which the Statement drew attention was this. It constitutes a formal international agreement, legally binding in all its parts. This is the highest form of commitment that can be given by one sovereign state to another. I agree. Do the Chinese Government accept this, and is there not every reason for assuming that they do? At the end of the day, of course, much depends on the good faith and honour of the Chinese Government and ourselves, which will be at stake in the coming years.<lb/>
We believe the agreement will, of course, provide benefits to China in many ways; not least by attracting the foreign trade and investments that China needs. We, too, may gain a great deal from the agreement; notably the Chinese commitment to retain the present social, economic and legal system in Hong Kong which has brought it prosperity and stability for so long, and to be largely unchanged for 50 years after 1997.<lb/>
Can the noble Lord tell the House what will be the position of the 2&#x00BD; million holders of British dependent territories passports? What will be the position of the children of those passport holders? Can he say a word or two about the joint liaison group which is to monitor the agreement? Is there any danger that this will have political consequences which could have effects upon the development of the agreement itself&#x2014;for instance, by perhaps interfering in Hong Kong's international affairs?<lb/>
Without going into the detail of the agreement and annexes may I particularly welcome certain parts of it, especially the assurances about freedom of religion and education and the right to handle external economic affairs. I conclude by wishing Hong Kong and its talented and industrious people, among whom many of us have many friends, a secure and happy future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01558"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to thank the noble Minister for repeating the Statement. I think that Her Majesty's Government and the Chinese Government are entitled to considerable credit for the successful negotiation of this agreement. In its style and content the agreement shows admirable sensitiveness to the fears and hopes of the people of Hong Kong and also to the very different ideological standpoints of China and the United Kingdom.<lb/>
I ask the noble Lord three specific questions. Obviously it is important that when the time of the changeover comes there should be a greater degree of self-government within the terms of the agreement than there is now. What proposals do Her Majesty's Government have for political development in the colony during the interim period? Second, can he give the assurance that representations made to the Assessment Office are completely confidential? When I was in Hong Kong earlier this month a number of people were worried that representations they made to the Assessment Office would be kept indefinitely and might even become known in the future to the Chinese Government and other authorities. Can the noble Lord give a complete assurance that representations made to the office will be completely confidential and that the papers will not be kept? I see no reason for keeping them beyond the end of November.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0158"/>
<col>299</col>
Finally, may we have the assurance that when the changeover takes place Her Majesty's Government will accept full responsibility for the admission to this country of at least certain special categories of Hong Kong citizens? I particularly have in mind those concerned with security and the police.<lb/>
We must all hope that the agreement will be carried out in the same admirable spirit in which it has been negotiated. Hong Kong is a phenomenal success and we on these Benches wish it well in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01559"><member>Lord Broxbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01560"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise for being a little slow to rise to my feet. I very much appreciate the reception which the noble and learned Lord and the noble Lord have given to this Statement. The Chinese Government have certainly accepted the position which I outlined in the Statement about the status of the agreement which we have reached.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord asked about the position of non-Chinese nationals born in Hong Kong to parents with the right of abode in the special administrative region, as it will come to be called. I can say that they will acquire the right of abode through their parents and will retain the right of abode after the age of 21 if they have lived for some time in Hong Kong, for a continuous period of seven years, and have taken Hong Kong as the place of permanent residence. I hope that answers the point raised by the noble and learned Lord.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, asked what interim developments might be made in the governmental system in Hong Kong. I know that this is a matter which my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary is thinking about at present and I believe that some changes will be made; particularly there is the possibility of introducing in the colony some form of elected representation, which the noble Lord will be aware does not exist at present.<lb/>
On the other point made by the noble Lord, I can say that our aim was to obtain arrangements which would provide a secure future for Hong Kong people in which to continue to live, work and raise their children. I am confident that we have achieved it. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary has the power, of course, to exercise his discretion in respect of applications for admission to the United Kingdom and certain other applications under the nationality legislation. Applications under these provisions will be considered on their merits in the future as in the past. Again, I am grateful to both the noble and learned Lord and the noble Lord for the reception that they have given to the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01561"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in thanking the Minister, may I press him a little further on the assessment process which my noble friend Lord Mayhew raised but which was not answered? Not only is there worry in Hong Kong about the names being kept and published after thirty years&#x2014;I hope this worry can be laid to rest here and now in this House&#x2014;but cannot the Government even now consider allowing the Assessment Office to set about its task in a slightly more outgoing way by, for example, using public opinion polls&#x2014;the Government of Hong Kong have a
<col>300</col>
well-tried mechanism for public opinion polls which is not being used in this all-important case&#x2014;by setting up district offices to which people may simply come and give their opinion verbally, rather than writing formally with a signature and everything; and, above all, simply by receiving telephone calls? Why are those things not being done? They would add greatly to the validity of the assessment if they were done.<lb/>
My second question is this. What has this Parliament left to do in the matter? What stages still face us? Do we expect a Bill amending the nationality legislation to look after people who would otherwise be stateless? There are a lot of people: not 2&#x00BD; million but 7,000 or 8,000. What steps must Parliament take to enshrine in legislation the transfer of sovereignty in 1997? When will those steps have to be taken to fit the schedule agreed with China?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01562"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, for not answering the point that he put to me about the assessment procedure and what may happen to the records that are prepared there. I can see no reason why the records need to be kept longer than is necessary for the Assessment Office to form its views. We hope that we shall get its report by the end of November. If I am wrong about that, perhaps I may be allowed to communicate with the noble Lord. But, as I say, I am not aware of any plans other than the ones to which I have referred.<lb/>
As for the question of conducting opinion polls among the people of Hong Kong, speaking for myself I have a fairly narrow respect for opinion polls. I think the results depend very much on the questions asked and the people involved in conducting them. Although I do not for a moment doubt the good intentions of the Hong Kong Government in conducting any such poll, I am not necessarily convinced that it would be the best way to proceed. As the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, is aware, it is necessary to proceed with reasonable dispatch over producing the results of the assessment procedure. I believe that the arrangements that we have set out are the best that can be devised in the circumstances. The noble Lord may be aware that in addition to the Assessment Office there are two monitors at work in the colony at the present time. One of them is Sir Patrick Nairne, who is a former very distinguished civil servant in this country; the other is a Judge Lee, who is of course a judge of Hong Kong origin.<lb/>
The noble Lord also asked about the possibility of anybody becoming stateless as a result of these arrangements. As he will be aware, there are international obligations upon us to ensure that we have regard to people who may, unfortunately, arrive in that circumstance. He is right to say that the numbers, if any, are likely to be very small indeed. The Government will certainly be bringing forward legislation to meet that case in due course and certainly in good time for 1997.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01563"><member>Lord Shepherd</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, most generous congratulations have been given to Her Majesty's Government and to the Government of the PRC in regard to this agreement. I think that that includes the officials in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (I dare not mention names) and equally the officials within the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0159"/>
<col>301</col>
PRC. I believe that very warm and generous appreciation should be expressed to the Governor, Sir Edward Youde, and especially to Sir S. Y. Chung, the senior member of the Non-Executive Council in Hong Kong, who have lived under considerable strain for some two years, with full knowledge and yet having to remain silent. I am delighted that they and the Legislative Council have been able, after full consideration, to give their support to this agreement. I hope that that will be seen as a very strong lead to the people of Hong Kong.<lb/>
Does the Minister agree, however, that this is only the first hurdle in retaining the confidence of Hong Kong? What will count now is how we move forward within Hong Kong in the implementation of the agreement. I was delighted by his reaction to the question about those who are stateless. It is a very small number, but that situation adds to the uncertainty and anxiety. I think that the noble Lord's second contribution will help us in that respect.<lb/>
There is a wider field in terms of right of abode or a place to go to, although I think that this is not the occasion to raise that. But I hope that the Minister will be open to see some of us. There is genuine anxiety and difficulty for some&#x2014;again a very small number. I believe that it will facilitate the change (which will be very considerable) that is required under the agreement in a relatively short time. I hope that Ministers will be willing to see some of us to look at these particular cases.<lb/>
I have one last thought to put to the Minister and the House in regard to the Statement. I hope that proposals for change within Hong Kong&#x2014;which will be required, and it will be very clear to the Government what they are&#x2014;will not be put forward too dogmatically. I do not know whether in Hong Kong there is a Green Paper procedure, but I would commend that&#x2014;putting forward proposals for discussion and consideration, as opposed to their being seen as a <i>diktat</i> from either Her Majesty's Government or the Governor. I think that we are in for a period of sensitivity in Hong Kong. I apologise for speaking for longer than I should. All the signs are that the agreement has been well received in Hong Kong. However, confidence is brittle, although, I am sure that we can retain confidence. This is an agreement that I should never have expected five or even three years ago. All parties and all others who have participated are to be congratulated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01564"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am much obliged to the noble Lord. I entirely agree with him that the way forward now is to secure the consent and confidence of the people of Hong Kong. I believe that that can be reflected through the machinery of the joint liaison group which is to be set up under the agreement. We shall certainly ensure that Hong Kong is appropriately represented on that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01565"><member>Lord Broxbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask two brief questions arising out of the constitutional position in respect of the Basic Law to which my noble friend has referred? As a preliminary question, may I ask him whether he is aware that the felicitous tribute to the Foreign Secretary paid by the noble and learned Lord
<col>302</col>
on the Front Bench opposite reflects and reinforces a similarly handsome tribute by the Opposition spokesman in the other place? As I am sure he is aware, all of us on all sides of this House are gratified to hear the tributes and share in the enthusiasm and gratitude that they express to the Ministers concerned.<lb/>
The Basic Law provisions are set out in Annex I to the draft agreement. My first question is this. The Government of the People's Republic of China express the intention that:
<quote>"The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China shall enact and promulgate a Basic Law,"</quote>
making Hong Kong a special administrative region. For those brought up in the traditions of this Parliament on the basis of the sovereignty of Parliament, is it not a curious concept that a government should be able to bind a legislature, especially at such a distant point of time? Do the Government here see any difficulties or hazards in the implementation of this undertaking?<lb/>
The second question arises also on Annex I, where the Basic Law is to provide that the socialist system and social policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and that Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and life style shall remain unchanged for 50 years. Does my noble friend the Minister agree that those are admirable sentiments but would be a challenge to draftsmanship of no mean order? Can we expect further and better particulars or more precise content of these praiseworthy provisions?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01566"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hope that my noble friend will not ask me for a precise recitation of the parliamentary procedures which are followed in China. I am bound to say that I should need to pause and reflect a while before offering any such thing!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01567"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would it be wrong to suggest that those parliamentary procedures in the Republic of China are very brief and very short?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01568"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, brief and short they may be, but I suspect that they are effective as well! To provide my noble friend with a serious answer to his important question, the Government are satisfied that the Chinese Government will be in a position to deliver the Basic Law, as they have undertaken to do in this agreement. It is of course some years off, as my noble friend rightly says; but the principles which are to be set out in that Basic Law are enunciated in the draft agreement which the Chinese Government have initialled. It is for that reason that the Government have complete confidence in them.<lb/>
The drafting of the law is for the Chinese Government themselves. However, as I say, the principles which they shall follow in that drafting are set out in the agreement. The Chinese have made it clear that the people of Hong Kong will be consulted.<lb/>
As for the further point made by my noble friend about the maintenance of the existing capitalist system in Hong Kong, I think one ought not to lose sight of the fact that the existence of that system, which is very different from the system that applies in the rest of China, is of some benefit to the people of China. For example, the Chinese earn large sums of foreign currency through Hong Kong at the present time. I do
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0160"/>
<col>303</col>
not think that they would like lightly to turn aside the benefits to them of maintaining the present system in Hong Kong.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01569"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I put two brief points to the noble Lord? I preface what I have to say by adding my congratulations to the Government on this remarkable achievement; to our Foreign Secretary for his arduous work and massive contribution and of course also to the representives of the Chinese Government for their so generous, sincere and worthwhile response. May I please ask the noble Lord if he can give the House an assurance that the policy which the Government have already adopted of keeping as many of the ordinary people of Hong Kong as possible involved in these negotiations will continue? Secondly, can he say, with regard to the joint liaison group, to whom it will be reporting and how often? Also will there be discussions on the reports of the joint liaison group?<lb/>
Lastly, the question of nationality is going to be very important. Can the noble Lord give some indication as to how it might be tackled in the years to come?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01570"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord asked how the people of Hong Kong could be involved in this matter. I think I can principally point to the assessment process on which we have embarked. No less than two million copies of the White Paper have been distributed in Hong Kong, most of them I believe in Chinese. Happily, this one is not! Therefore the people of Hong Kong, most of whom speak Chinese, will be able to determine what is proposed and express their views upon it.<lb/>
As for the joint liaison group, that will report to both Governments from time to time. I am not quite sure with what frequency it is proposed that that group should report. However, if I can find any more information about that, I shall certainly let the noble Lord know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01571"><member>Lord Fanshawe of Richmond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that I fully support the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, regarding the result of this very excellent agreement over the future of Hong Kong?&#x2014;although perhaps I do not share in total the euphoria expressed in some quarters.<lb/>
I want to ask the Minister two brief questions, one of which he may be able to answer and the other which he may not. What is going to be the situation regarding the judiciary in Brunei, which at the moment comes under the judiciary in Hong Kong? Will they continue to be administered from Hong Kong up to the time of the treaty taking effect in 1997, or will there be special arrangements made?<lb/>
The second point relates to the position of the Brigade of Gurkhas. The battalion of Gurkhas which is stationed in Brunei is administered and run from Hong Kong. What will be their position in the future? I ask this question because my noble friend is a Minister in the Ministry of Defence and I thought that this might be an appropriate time to raise the subject of the Brigade of Gurkhas.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01572"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is clear from the agreement that the question of the defence of Hong
<col>304</col>
Kong will pass to the Chinese Government in 1997. So there will be no question of the Gurkhas remaining in Hong Kong after that time.<lb/>
As regards the judiciary, I am aware that there have also been some changes in Brunei recently. I therefore suspect that the arrangements after 1997 will be different from what they are now. However, I fear I was caught slightly on the hop with that question. If my noble friend will allow me, I will see what additional information I can find and convey it to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01573"><member>The Earl of Bessborough</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having been in the People's Republic of China during the final stages of these negotiations, and indeed at Shanghai at the time of the initialling of the text, is my noble friend aware how remarkably well this joint declaration was received, not only by the mainland Chinese but also&#x2014;as I have found in Hong Kong&#x2014;by many of our friends there who had perhaps been doubtful and anxious at the outset? I do not know whether the noble Lord is aware of this, but it was very striking that in the course of the protracted negotiations with Chinese corporations they were constantly referring to the entrepreneurial ability of the British in Hong Kong and the British in this country. I hope the Minister is aware of that. It struck me very forcibly that both sides to this agreement seemed to receive it remarkably well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01574"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. I think his remarks underline what I said earlier, that there are some advantages to both sides in the agreement that has been reached.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01575"><member>Lord Caccia</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as an old China hand, having served there over 50 years ago, may I from these Benches, add my words of congratulation upon the agreement that has been reached and to the people who have been engaged in it? It is a remarkable agreement. I cannot speak for those on these Benches but I should not want them to remain silent on such an occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01576"><member>Lord Soames</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that this is a great achievement for the diplomacy both of Her Majesty's Government and of the Government of the People's Republic? As to the longer term future, this must surely depend upon the awareness of the People's Republic of China of Hong Kong's importance for them as well as for the people of Hong Kong. Her Majesty's Government will have a considerable part to play in the next 10 or 15 years in assuring that awareness.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01579"><member>Lord Teviot</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what action they are proposing to take following the publication of the White Paper on Buses (Cmnd. 9300).</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0161"/>
<col>305</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01580">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper. At the outset, let me say that I am very grateful for the fact that, as is usual in your Lordships' House, we shall during this debate have the benefit of the wisdom of noble Lords of all persuasions and interests.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01581">Road passenger transport is a very important subject. The White Paper merits a formal debate rather than an Unstarred Question such as we now have before us. Nevertheless we are starting at a reasonable hour, although there were moments when I was wondering whether we were going to. However, there again, your Lordships have been discussing a most important Statement. I should also like to say that I am delighted to welcome my noble friend Lord Brabazon, who is cutting his teeth on a subject to which he is new. I look forward to his winding-up speech. I would add that I am grateful to him for discussing matters beforehand.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01582">There is no need for me to introduce myself on this subject. For many years I have been closely connected with the bus industry. I have also taken account of views expressed by users, local authorities, bus operators and their associations. To add a final note to this brief introduction, I can fairly say that I have been involved with no White Paper arousing such controversy without prior consultation by way of a Green Paper. The fact is that the whole provision of bus services in the country is likely to be stood on its head. This makes it all the more vital for Parliament to consider the White Paper and its implications in some depth.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01583">I would at once like to make it clear that there is much in the White Paper with which I agree. It is right that we should direct our minds to the needs of the public and should strive with compassion and within reason to satisfy these needs. The opening paragraphs of the White Paper clearly demonstrate these objectives. We must also welcome moves to maintain and to tighten control over quality and safety. That is in the interests of bus users and indeed other road users.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01584">It is also important to ensure that available resources are used wisely and that, through striving to increase efficiency, the bus industry should extend the level of service it can provide from the revenue derived from fare-paying passengers. In this respect the introduction of competition is extremely relevant. Concessionary fare schemes were introduced for the benefit of the user, not of the bus company. That, again, is a right perspective. However, it is easier said than done to ensure that all operators will participate in these schemes on an equitable basis. While one believes that a professional bus service is the most desirable way of meeting public need, it cannot be denied that there are areas where this is not possible and the use of alternative transport must here be welcomed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01585">Having said that, there are aspects of the White Paper that give me cause for concern. Not least is the way in which the historic background has been presented&#x2014;even distorted&#x2014;to support policies put forward in the paper. It may be thought that if the premises upon which the arguments are founded are inaccurate, the solutions may themselves be
<col>306</col>
inaccurate. This is something that I should like to consider.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01586">In the first place, the system of road service licensing introduced in the 1930 Act is described as "highly restrictive." I would suggest that it is not nearly as restrictive as the bureaucratic control now applied in the Hereford trial area. Far from leading to neglect of the best parts of the market, the licensing system encouraged operators to look for new and interesting destinations which would not otherwise have been served, rather than to seek to indulge in the undesirable practices of the 1920s when competing on established routes. I put it to your Lordships that this licensing system was the reason why Great Britain developed a network of bus and coach services that became the envy of all other countries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01587">No system is better than the men who administer it, and the human element has at times been less than perfect. But, from my own experience, I doubt whether any operator who cannot obtain a licence under the present somewhat modified system of road service licensing is really capable of providing the sort of service upon which the public can depend. The rule is that an operator must be given the licence that he applies for unless that is seen by the impartial traffic commissioners to be against the public interest. That is hardly restrictive and the process of preparing a licence application has ultimate benefits for all concerned.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01588">Next, my Lords, I would consider the claims made for deregulation of all bus and coach services, other than local bus services, under the Transport Act 1980. My purpose is not to object to deregulation in the commercial areas of coach operation&#x2014;although there is danger in making comparison with the bus operations of the industry which are essential for many people and include a considerable element of social service. Many routes, both urban and rural, can never be fully self-supporting. Yet the praise accorded to the 1980 deregulation reflects only a part of the picture. Undoubtedly, more passengers are travelling by express coach now than in 1980. The decline during the second half of the 1970s has been reversed. But the number of passengers carried has only been restored to what it was in 1975.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01589">Moreover, much of this gain has been at the expense of British Rail. That has actually concealed the loss of express coach services from some minor cross country routes and from a large number of smaller intermediate towns on trunk routes. Operators could not commercially justify serving these towns with the revised pattern of operation while their energies were concentrated on the main routes. Let there be no doubt that whatever the gains, the new pattern of express operation did deprive many people of services they had previously enjoyed. That, however, is less important than would be the case with the more immediate needs of bus travellers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01590">Even accepting the benefits, the claim&#x2014;or rather suggestion&#x2014;made in the White Paper that between 1980 and 1983, 700 new express services were introduced is absurd. The figure relates to notifications of express services under Section 3 of the Act, now Section 2 of the consolidating Act. Many notified services were never operated at all; many were soon withdrawn; many were variations of existing routes or
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0162"/>
<col>307</col>
timetables; many were changes of operating company within a group. What is the true figure? I would suggest that no more than 10 per cent. of this 700 are genuine new routes opened up since 1980.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01591">Perhaps it is even more important to note that deregulation did not lead to competition between coach operators. As those with experience predicted, the big battalions have dominated the scene to an even greater degree since deregulation. Some new passenger markets, such as the student population, have been developed, but the real competition has been with British Rail. There is a lesson to be learned here.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01592">There are other matters arising from the 1980 Transport Act about which one could be critical&#x2014;such as the functioning of operator licensing&#x2014;but time does not permit. However, the third historical area on which I must comment is also the outcome of that Act. This is the way in which the White Paper deals with the trial areas. It is curious that the claims of success in Chapters 1 and 4 of the White Paper are in no way justified by the analysis in Part II of Annex 3 of the same paper.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01593">Moreover, the long awaited survey by the Secretary of State's own Transport and Road Research Laboratory clearly shows that it is too early to use any of these trial areas to justify the major changes proposed in the White Paper and yet claimed to be supported by experience in these areas.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01594">As I have said, we have only just received the long awaited study from the TRRL. One had wondered if it was to be suppressed. So, with a deep thirst for seeing things for myself, I have visited and studied the Hereford trial area&#x2014;which is claimed to be the gem of the three. In its own way, it is an interesting experiment and, to be fair, my visit to this delightful part of the country upset my preconceived ideas. But, looked at as a prototype for the rest of Britain, scrutiny of this gem shows that it is no more than paste.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01595">I have held discussions with the county council, with the City of Hereford, with representatives of the users and with operators from the public and private sectors. I saw with my own eyes the traffic congestion in the city at the market day peak. Whatever statistics may seem to show, the public has not really gained from two buses running at the same time, from "leap-frogging", buses taking short-cuts on unauthorised roads and other malpractices rife before road service licensing was introduced. There are not enough passengers to justify the number of buses which fill the narrow streets of Hereford, upsetting the shopkeepers and others. It is perfectly obvious that there is wasteful competition. The position is unstable and it must be a matter of surprise that it has continued in this way for so long.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01596">The city council regard the trial area as a disaster and explained their problems to me with great courtesy and in detail. Their concern about safety has been reinforced only this week when one operator had two of his five buses put off the road with brake and steering defects. Three out of the four new operators have at some stage had their licences revoked.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01597">When I met the Hereford Federation of Women's Institutes, the ladies, drawn from all parts of the old county, were grateful for the increased level of service
<col>308</col>
and the lower fares, but they were fearful that city fares reduced from 35p to 10p were rumoured to be on the point of being increased to 50p. Present joy, but future foreboding.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01598">The only others who were enthusiastic about the trial area were the county council, but even there Mr. Carrington, chairman of the transport committee, told me that it was essential that services put out to tender should be controlled by the county. In other words, he denied the possibility of tenders for services being allied with total deregulation. What is more, all operators were of the opinion that this control by the county was bureaucratic and more restrictive than that formerly experienced under the traffic commissioners. In any event Mr. Carrington, with his experience as the pioneer of trial areas, has brought us face to face with the conflict of the White Paper. Tendering for services will not work with deregulation. Both are ways of introducing desired competition, but&#x2014;as one was taught at school&#x2014;a positive and a negative make a negative.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01599">Let me take a simple example, the county seeks tenders on the amount of subsidy required to run a particular service seven days a week from 6 a.m. till 11 p.m. It has been paying &#x00A3;5,000 a year in subsidy but I win the contract with a tender of &#x00A3;4,000. Then another operator, who has a vehicle on contract work from 10 a.m. till 4.30 p.m., decides that he can make a profit by running this bus on my route, at lower fares, during the peak&#x2014;7.30 to 9.30 a.m. and 4.30 to 6.00 p.m. As a result, my revenue falls by &#x00A3;5,000. Either the county must pay me an extra &#x00A3;5,000 to keep going or I must take the service off. If the county has the money&#x2014;which is also very unlikely&#x2014;it will be &#x00A3;4,000 worse off under the new system. If it has not, the public will be left with a far worse service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01600">The example may be over-simplified but it demonstrates the point&#x2014;a point, I must add, of major concern to the associations of both county and district councils. The result is negative. It is bad. It is a waste of public money, and for that reason it is not to be compared with commercial competition as, for example, between two butchers. We have only one butcher in this case.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01601">Another visit that I made was to Manchester, at the invitation of the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive. This was a valuable experience. Not only was I given a professional overview by the men at the top, but it was arranged for me to be taken around, early in the morning, to see their operation at work.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01602">If I can digress for one moment, if any of your Lordships wish to view a transport or bus operation in action, it is important to see a bus garage going to work and then to be taken around the areas where the passengers are waiting at the bus stops and to come back and view the traffic at the peak period. After seeing that you can with justification have some breakfast&#x2014;even a large breakfast&#x2014;and you have deserved it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01603">The Greater Manchester PTE has a fleet of over 2,000 vehicles and co-ordinates with British Rail. Its statutory duty is to secure or promote the provision of a properly integrated and efficient system of public transport to meet the needs of the area. As far as
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0163"/>
<col>309</col>
Manchester is concerned, I can see that they have done exactly that. They must also have regard to town planning, traffic and parking policies. Now, with reorganisation and the emphasis on deregulation, everything seems to be heading full speed astern. What none of us wishes to see is the deterioration of service&#x2014;that could add even more to traffic congestion. There is another area which gives me great concern; namely, the quality of service. Remember Hereford, my Lords.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01604">I come to the main issue. If we are to have deregulation we must forget all about tendering for meaningless contracts. Services will run only where there is commercial advantage, and the cohesive network&#x2014;which is fundamental to the very first sentences of the White Paper&#x2014;will inevitably be put at risk. No, my Lords, we must not sacrifice the co-ordination introduced by a Conservative Government through the Local Government Act of 1972 (1973 in Scotland). Rather, we must follow the White Paper by introducing competition through tenders for subsidised services&#x2014;but into the co-ordinated network. We must retain a necessary degree of regulation if we are to retain necessary services.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01605">There is just one other major point on which I must dwell. I am referring to what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State describes as the "vice" of cross-subsidy. If it be a vice, then it is one practised&#x2014;at least&#x2014;in every service industry. When I stick a postage stamp on an inland letter it has the same value be the addressee one mile or 500 miles or more away. The busy shop assistant has periods standing around in any empty shop. There are many forms of cross-subsidy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01606">For the bus passenger the problem is that for every &#x00A3;1 of subsidy from central and local government, the industry itself provides some &#x00A3;3 in cross-subsidy. If the Government reduce their support to counties and regions&#x2014;and they have clearly indicated this intention&#x2014;that will be nothing to the deficits created by the loss of cross-subsidy in a fully deregulated market. The county losing &#x00A3;2 million in Government support might find it needs &#x00A3;5 million or &#x00A3;6 million to maintain existing bus services&#x2014;allowing on the one hand for increased efficiency and on the other for "creaming" on subsidised services&#x2014;we are back to the problems of the predominantly Conservative associations of county and district councils.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01607">What a tragedy it would be if the benefits accruing from some of the proposals in the White Paper entitled, <i>Buses</i> should be put at risk by an excess of zeal. There are many people in the country who inescapably depend on the bus; there are others who would suffer from its loss. Therefore, I appeal to the Government to think again, to look at the points raised on all sides and not leave too much work to be done when a Bill comes before your Lordships' House. Let us all seek genuine improvements in the health of the bus industry, but let us make sure that we do not prescribe a cure based on a false diagnosis&#x2014;otherwise the patient will get worse, not better.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01608">My Lords, I have spoken for long enough. I have not the time to cover all aspects of the White Paper. Sadly, there has not been time for me to discuss the merits or
<col>310</col>
demerits of dismantling the National Bus Company, which has become a highly efficient and competitive force&#x2014;that will be for others to do. What I have tried to do, however, is to set a platform for your Lordships to follow your own particular interests. My final message is that, whatever happens, the needs of the public must come first and here I echo the National Consumer Council, in their response to the White Paper, by saying that there are considerable practical difficulties involved in implementing the Government's proposals. If when my noble friend comes to wind up he can answer the queries raised by the untried trial areas and if he can show that the Government are really alive to the practical problems, I shall be a happier man.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01609">5.19 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01610"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, not only for having put down this Unstarred Question which enables us to discuss the White Paper&#x2014;and it may be the only chance that we shall have&#x2014;but also for the way in which he has presented it. I am certain that he has put forward some very formidable arguments for the Minister to deal with. Frankly, the White Paper is putting back the clock. Proposals for deregulation, the abandonment of the principle of cross-subsidisation, the break up of bus operations of the passenger transport executives and the municipal undertakings and the destruction of the National Bus Company&#x2014;none of these has anything to do with the provision of effective public transport. They have to do with the regrettable adherence of the Government to their belief that market forces can solve everything, that privatisation can solve everything, and they have little regard to actual public needs. I was very pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, stressed the matter of public needs. This is to be followed by changes in the transport supplementary grant administration which have a great effect on public transport.<lb/>
As the noble Lord has said, the Government assured everyone that the changed criteria for granting road service licences under the 1980 Act was what was needed. As he said, it placed a duty upon the traffic commissioners to grant a licence unless it was against the public interest. What would be the position of those operators who were refused a licence on the ground of it being against the public interest? Under deregulation what happens to them? Apparently they can be included, provided that they can fulfil safety and other requirements.<lb/>
Why are the Government now going for deregulation, in the light of their own provisions in the 1980 Act; or are the Government telling us that their own proposals in the 1980 Act are not working? I wonder whether the real reason is not to be found in the Transport and Road Research Laboratory's own Report No. 1098, which deals with developments from the 1980 Act. I should like to quote two conclusions. Conclusion 4 says:
<quote>"Few new examples of private versus public sector competition had emerged in any of the sample areas"&#x2014;</quote>
and there were six areas&#x2014;
<quote>"and when it had public sector operators had usually retaliated with fares reductions or increased local provision. No major incursions into urban territory had occurred".</quote>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0164"/>
<col>311</col>
Conclusion 8 states:
<quote>"Overall it seems fair to conclude that there were relatively few significant changes in fare levels or policies between October 1980 and January 1983 that were directly attributable to the Transport Act".</quote>
Those are the TRRL's own conclusions upon what happened under the 1980 Act.<lb/>
The Secretary of State first declared his intentions at a dinner of the Bus and Coach Council. I was present at that dinner, and, frankly, I was rather amazed that a man who had only just got his feet under the table should so soon be making statements as to what he intended to do with bus transport. One can only assume that he had some polemical arguments that he wished to follow. Then, as with other legislation, the White Paper was cobbled together to justify the aims which he wanted to achieve.<lb/>
The Bus and Coach Council represents 98 per cent. of all bus operators in this country&#x2014;private, independent, municipal, PTEs, the NBC and so on&#x2014;and, incidentally, two thirds of the coach operators. What have they said? They have said that,
<quote>"Abolition of route licensing would mean that many people who depend on buses"&#x2014;</quote>
and they point out that 39 per cent. of households have no car&#x2014;
<quote>"might be left with a worse service or no service at all".</quote>
The noble Lord, Lord Teviot, referred to the views of local councils. Time does not permit me to mention them all, but two of the associations&#x2014;the AMA and the district councils&#x2014;strongly oppose deregulation. The county councils are neither for nor against, but they have expressed very great concern at certain aspects of deregulation and of tendering, saying that there seems to be no protection against creaming off. The Association of District Councils said to the Secretary of State:
<quote>"No evidence has been put forward to demonstrate the need for any further general de-regulation of stage carriage bus services. The vast majority of operators &#x2026; are firmly opposed to what appear to be ill conceived proposals based on flimsy ideas of what is desired or possible".</quote>
The AMA, of which I am president, expressed similar views, but I have quoted the organisation with which I am not associated.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Teviot, referred to the consumers. Perhaps we can see what they actually said. The chairman of the National Consumer Council's transport working party said this:
<quote>"There is a chance of very real threats from de-regulation. It has not been thought through: there is a great deal of dogma. Those making the decisions are not in touch with the real needs of the people".</quote>
The first question must be: will the Government take heed of everything that is being said about the White Paper? As the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, said, it is regrettable that there was not first a Green Paper on proposals before the Government declared their intentions. Also, if deregulation is the panacea for all the transport troubles, why is the whole of the London conurbation being left out? The Government have complete control there under London Regional Transport, and we argued that in the last Transport Bill.<lb/>
The Government's justification is based on trial areas, and the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, referred to
<col>312</col>
this. He also referred to the fact that the Transport Road Research Laboratory's Report No. 1131 was published on 26th September, after the White Paper, but we understand that the Secretary of State had knowledge of what was in the document before he produced his White Paper. I should love to read out the whole of the document, but I do not suppose that noble Lords would wish me to do so. Perhaps I may quote from two conclusions in the Transport and Road Research Laboratory's Report No. 1131, which was published on 26th September this year. One of them states:
<quote>"Any conclusions drawn from experience in the three Trial Areas must be qualified by the fact that they are based on a limited set of largely rural areas over a limited period of time. Furthermore, the trial areas have not been isolated from economic factors (e.g. pressure on financial resources, declining demand) which have influenced the provision of bus services everywhere".</quote>
The last conclusion says:
<quote>"It is clearly too early to determine whether the public will benefit in the longer-term. Under present conditions, de-regulation in itself may not be sufficient to allow small operators however efficient, to compete successfully with established operators with greater resources".</quote>
The Bus and Coach Council's president has said that his council rejects the evidence of the trial areas as a basis for countrywide deregulation.<lb/>
It must be pointed out that the largest city in any of the three areas was Hereford, with a population of 47,000. Yet because of what happened in Hereford&#x2014;which we say was a disaster&#x2014;the Government say that this could be applicable to Sheffield, with a population of half a million, Manchester, and so on.<lb/>
I wish it was possible to give many quotations, but time will not allow. However, there is certainly not the case for deregulation which the Government claim. The overwhelming majority of subsidised routes are through the networks&#x2014;either the networks of the passenger transport executives in the conurbations or the regional subsidiaries of the National Bus Company, partly from cross-subsidy from profitable routes and partly from revenue support. It may be useful to quote what the National Bus Company said. It is far better if I give quotations rather than say what I think; let other people who are experienced operators say what they think. The annual report of the National Bus Company, which was published recently, says that the company is,
<quote>"concerned that proposals that would remove the requirements for some form of road service licence"&#x2014;</quote>
that is, route licensing&#x2014;
<quote>"would seriously undermine the established structure of bus networks, particularly in the urban areas".</quote>
It goes on:
<quote>"Clearly any relaxation of licensing which allowed operators to compete on the profitable routes without any obligation to plough back some of the profits into loss making routes would undermine the network to the detriment of all.</quote>
<quote>"A study which NBC commissioned into the subject and carried out in 1983 jointly with the Institute for Transport Studies of the University of Leeds has identified the important role played by cross-subsidy in maintaining networks of bus services".</quote>
I hope that the Minister will not criticise what I have said about the NBC's report, because all Ministers have praised the National Bus Company for its splendid efforts and the results it has achieved in reaching its financial margins, and everything. But it is
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0165"/>
<col>313</col>
to be rewarded by being broken up into small pieces as is suggested in the Government's White Paper, and then it is to be sold to the private sector. No real case is advanced in the White Paper as to why the Government are interfering with the National Bus Company, or why, as the National Bus Company itself says, they are prepared to risk breaking up this network of integrated services.<lb/>
Without service networks, cross-subsidy is virtually impossible, and that is admitted in the White Paper. In paragraph 5.1 they say that only 8 per cent. of stage carriage mileage is by private operators. In the following paragraph, paragraph 5.2, they say that most of the private operators have only five vehicles or less, and you cannot run a network, you cannot run cross-subsidisation, on five vehicles or less.<lb/>
Everybody agrees that with deregulation there will be private operators who will try to skim the cream. We know that there are good operators. There are at least one or two good operators in Hereford. The National Bus Company at Hereford recognises there are good operators. But the Government have suggested that all subsidised services shall be subject to competitive tender. If it is desired, there will be no necessity under those arrangements for the National Bus Company to recognise any social obligation to cross-subsidise. That would obviously affect parts of its network.<lb/>
The policy would also destroy the network of services of the passenger transport executives in the conurbations. Even the White Paper, in paragraph 3.5, recognises that to carry out what they want in the PTEs they will have to change the duties laid on the PTEs under the 1968 Act.<lb/>
Seven consultation papers have been issued. The one on tendering says that where possible each service should be put out to a separate tender. They suggest that a number of contracts should come up each year, and they envisage contracts of three or four years' duration, although for experimental ones annual contracts may be desirable.<lb/>
A local authority has to invite the contracts. It may want to invite for a complete service; it may want to invite tenders only on certain days, or at certain times, because there are routes which are profitable at certain times of the day and on certain days but not at other times. Therefore the local authority has a job to do. But how does the White Paper suggest that local authorities shall face up to this? It is thin on the mechanics involved. All it says in paragraph 3.7 is:
<quote>"Some additional staff effort may be required to administer the new arrangements."</quote>
It is not even admitting some additional staff&#x2014;just additional staff effort.<lb/>
The local authorities will have to identify the services for tender. This alone will be a massive task. If they want value for money they will naturally be concerned with the levels of fares; they will be concerned with the frequency of services at peak and off-peak periods; they will be concerned with what is being provided on weekdays and at weekends.<lb/>
Having selected the services to go to tender, having awarded the contracts, every local authority which does this, if it is doing its job properly, will want to monitor what is happening and to have enforcement.
<col>314</col>
What do the Government say? They say that there may have to be "some additional staff effort" to deal with this. That is all they say. There is no idea as to how the local authorities are to carry out this job at all.<lb/>
It will mean a lot of bureaucracy and a geat deal of administration. I hope that the Minister recognises that it will inevitably mean that there must be an increase in the inspection staff. Unless there is, then these matters cannot possibly be monitored effectively.<lb/>
There was criticism in Hereford, which was part of the trial area, that published timetables were being ignored, buses were running short of route, and even turning short. The noble Lord, Lord Teviot, has explained a visit he made to Hereford. He was able to carry out far more inquiries than I was when I visited Hereford, but I too saw the congestion in a small city centre. I also heard the criticisms to which I have referred, that the county council seemed to be unable to enforce even conditions to which they had agreed.<lb/>
We had the concentration in Hereford on the more profitable routes at the best times. There was concern in the city, as the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, says about congestion in this rather small city area. I went around a housing estate. There was an NBC bus in front of us, a Midland Red; behind us an independent bus was running. We missed him. He disappeared because he had gone off-route. Possibly he had been told that there were two women waiting around the corner and so he decided to go round and take them. If Hereford is a guide, tendering will result in a number of operators coming on the best routes, but off-peak and on Sundays either just a single operator&#x2014;often a different operator&#x2014;and, if NBC decide not to carry on services on unprofitable routes and cross-subsidise them, there will be no operator at all.<lb/>
The Government issued a consultation paper on tendering. I quote what it says on one point:
<quote>"Matters such as wage rates or working practices, or indeed any stipulation not related to the service to be offered would not be permitted."</quote>
It states that normally the authority must accept the lowest tender.<lb/>
This is an encouragement to lower standards. I would remind the House of an amendment I tried to move to the provisions of the Employment Bill on contracts for councils, and of what we were told. My noble friend Lord Carmichael moved at Committee stage, at Report stage and at Third Reading, amendments to lay down wages and conditions in tenders that the LRT would have to issue under the London Regional Transport Bill. What were we told by the Government? At Committee stage we were told: "More tests in any way will hinder progress". At Report stage it was said that this, "would frustrate rather than encourage competition" Then, at Third Reading they said, "We are not anxious to insert unnecessary obstacles".<lb/>
We are likely to have a complete deterioration in standards. I hope that the Minister has seen and read all the words of the three appeals by independent operators in Hereford. I have. I hope that the Secretary of State has read them. As the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, says, over the past two years three of the four independent operators there had their licences revoked. Two were restored on appeal to the Secretary
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0166"/>
<col>315</col>
of State, but the number of their vehicles was reduced to three and their periods were also limited.<lb/>
One operator whose licence was revoked used a layby as the operating centre. There were woefully inadequate and disgraceful maintenance standards. There were 47 defects and 27 immediate defects, which means that the vehicle could not be put on the road until they had been dealt with. These are ageing vehicles. They are not buses, they are coaches. There is also evidence in here of scandalous wages offered to drivers and fitters to carry out some of the work.<lb/>
I hope that noble Lords saw the <i>Guardian</i> yesterday. Another firm at Hereford is before the Commissioners for disgraceful maintenance conditions. I hope your Lordships all read it so that I can save time by not doing so. There are few maintenance problems regarding the subsidiaries of the National Bus Company; there are few maintenance problems with the passenger transport executive bus operations or with the municipal undertakings because they have other interests.<lb/>
In July 1982 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission considered the West Midlands PTE buses and the Bristol and Trent buses of the National Bus Company and looked at the Cardiff municipal bus undertaking and, by and large, gave them a clean bill of health on these matters. But if Hereford is an example, the problem of inspection and monitoring will be an immense task and the Minister must tell us how it is to be done.<lb/>
I must not speak for much longer. We recognise that we can use unconventional means of transport: the minibus, the community bus, the post bus; all these would help. The White Paper seems to suggest that only one third of the minibuses are now used as passenger service vehicles and there might be an increased use of them. I hope that the Minister understands that economic factors and not legislation often prevent the wider use of minibuses on stage bus services. I am not an operator, but I have spoken to operators and I know that reliable operators will say that it is not always economic to run a minibus. A big bus can be flexible; a small bus cannot. One cannot push 50 people into a minibus at peak hours when they are leaving work. Therefore the answer is not only the minibus; there are other factors.<lb/>
I have mentioned the measures to destroy the National Bus Company. I do not want anything done in Scotland. It is rather interesting that nothing is being done to the Scottish bus group. That is being left completely, and yet it is functioning in Scotland, just like the National Bus Company elsewhere. It is strange that when the Government want to hit the National Bus Company they use certain arguments, but when they want to praise the National Bus Company they compare its costs in the public Passenger Transport Executive with the cost of the PTE's bus undertakings. District undertakings are to be interfered with&#x2014;those in the municipal areas; some 50 of them. They will be prevented from receiving local council subsidies to meet deficits. In the six metropolitan counties the PTE bus operations are to be broken down into smaller units; turned into companies with the same restrictions on financial support. There is even
<col>316</col>
encouragement in the White Paper for districts to secede from the PTE bus operations.<lb/>
PTEs are responsible for developing integrated services. That is laid upon them under the 1968 Act. An organisation along the lines of a PTE bus operation as well as PTEs in general are essential if we are to develop the Section 20 grants towards rail services which play a great part in the conurbations. The PTEs, with the National Bus Company, are the base of training in the bus industry, and that will go. Services for the disabled and other special groups are in the main provided by the public undertakings, for obvious reasons. The costs that would fall on a private undertaker would be fairly big. The major public operators in the large conurbations undertake major developments of integrated transport systems. All this is at risk. I repeat what I said before: if London is to be excluded, why not exclude all the big conurbations from the deregulation proposals. The same arguments apply there.<lb/>
There is no reference in the White Paper to the railways. There is no reference to integration or co-ordination of services. Yet the railways play a big part in the conurbations, as well as elsewhere. There is no reference to planning and land use and the relationship with transportation. There is no word about traffic management schemes organised by the local authorities. There is no reference to the fact that what is proposed is breaking up the transport policies and programmes of the county councils. I hope that all these matters raised in this debate will be considered by the Government. May we hope that they will listen and either drastically modify their proposals or leave this terrible menace to our public bus company out of their next year's programme?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01612"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, must thank most gratefully the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, not only for having placed this Question on the Order Paper but for the quite remarkable speech that he made in asking his Question. I was deeply impressed by what he said and, coming from the Government Back Benches, although it was addressed courteously to the Government Front Bench, I am sure that the Government ought to take very seriously what he said because it struck me as being a devastating speech from the Government point of view.<lb/>
May I also take this opportunity, which I have not had before, of welcoming Lord Brabazon of Tara to the Front Bench. I feel sorry for him that he has had to step into this particular maelstrom as his first baptism of fire&#x2014;to mix my metaphors rather gloriously. May I also take this opportunity of wishing all the best to the noble Lord, Lord Lucas of Chilworth, on his departure for higher things. I am sorry that he is not in his place at present but I am sure he will read what is said. Over the period of time we have trained him in transport matters&#x2014;or at least the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, has&#x2014;and we had a really quite interesting three ring circus going. I hope that we can continue it with the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon.<lb/>
There is a great temptation to make a Second Reading speech on a non-existent Bill on this occasion because the items contained in the White Paper are so provocative. I think that one would like to make a
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0167"/>
<col>317</col>
Second Reading speech in order that one does not have to make a Second Reading speech; in other words, so that the Bill will never emerge in the form which appears possible.<lb/>
One of the worrying things is, as has already been said, the time table for this whole process. Once again the Government have introduced a White Paper immediately before a Recess. Once more there is immense pressure for consultation to take place and when it cannot take place in the very short time scale they extend the period of the consultation. Nevertheless the Queen's Speech is due next week and one suspects&#x2014;though I do not expect the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, to be able to comment on this because I am sure that he has not yet seen the Queen's Speech&#x2014;that we shall find ourselves with something related to the White Paper in the form of legislation long before the consultation process has been completed. On this issue that would be most unfortunate.<lb/>
Having said all that and having agreed entirely with what has been said by the two previous speakers, it is probably worthwhile and proper to go on record to say that it would be foolish to suggest that all is well in the stage carriage business in this country. There is no doubt, as the White Paper points out, that while the travel market has increased by 150 per cent. in the past 30 years bus usage has halved; from 1972 to 1982 costs have increased by between 15 and 30 per cent. in real terms and revenue support has gone up by 13 times. I should be the last to pretend that in that situation we can be complacent about the state of the buses in this country, although on the financial side it should be noted that most of the increases in cost were in the 1972&#x2013;75 period when the system was being set up, and that the increase from 1974 to 1982 was only 15 per cent. in real terms. One can play with statistics and point out that the increase between 1980 and 1982 was 57 per cent., but most of that was in the metropolitan counties and the GLC and we have been round that bit of the track several times already in the past. One can also point out that the support for the English shire counties fell in the 1973&#x2013;80 period and in 1982&#x2013;83.<lb/>
Nevertheless there is a need for review and change. I hope to make some positive suggestions at the end of what I fear will be a largely critical speech. From the doctrinaire point of view there is a danger on the one hand of falling over into a belief in total planning. There may be areas where we have had far too much of that and the whole thing has become extremely bureaucratic and increasingly inefficient. I am sure that some members on the Government side will point to that. Similarly people on this side of the House will point out that the total free run of market forces will not succeed either, and I fear the Government have fallen into that trap in their White Paper.<lb/>
The whole concept of planning for the future has changed in recent years. I think that I have said this before in your Lordships' House, and I shall say it again, in industry planning is no longer regarded as a question of predicting the future. There was a time when planning was a question of forecasting numbers, putting them into a computer and then the computer would tell you what you have to do. That, fortunately, in industry is no longer acceptable. Industrialists now
<col>318</col>
talk about planning for an uncertain future. The future is not predictable but you can plan for it. And it is the lack of planning in this document which is the worrying thing.<lb/>
Certainly the sort of unbridled competition which one feels runs as a thread through the document is not the answer to the problems of the buses. There seems to be a naive and pious assumption that market forces alone will provide the services that the consumer needs, will provide information to the consumer, will provide the interchange facilities and many of the other things which the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, mentioned. They will not. But perhaps it is that the Government do not care if they do not.<lb/>
Let me talk briefly about the situation in the conurbations. We are faced with the abolition of the metropolitan counties, however much resistance may come from noble Lords on this side of the House and in another place; and transport is one of the things which are being put in the hands of joint boards made up of district council nominees. But if we look at paragraph 5.13 in the White Paper we see, set out in black type, a positive encouragement for district councils to secede from those joint boards. How will it be possible, if those joint boards are not composed of all the district councils involved, for an urban-wide service to be provided, for any system of through ticketing to be provided, for any comprehensive timetabling to be provided&#x2014;and timetabling is something to which I should like to come back&#x2014;and how will there ever be the possibility again to build the sort of new interchanges like the Bradford bus/rail interchange? And how will it be possible for a single operator to afford to do many of these things?<lb/>
The problem in the conurbations is that passenger journeys do not fit into district boundaries; 50 per cent. of them are cross-boundary; and that is in a typical PTE. Some 10 per cent. of the journeys are single bus and train journeys across the conurbation. By all means let us decentralise the PTEs but let us keep strategic control over them in the hands of some democratic overall authority. I am not opposed to decentralisation if it provides more creative, more competitive, more efficient operation; but there must be some co-ordination of their activities, otherwise, as we have said during proceedings on the London Regional Transport Bill, this is a recipe for disintegration.<lb/>
Let me come back to the question of passenger information. The operator is obliged to register timings and routes with the vehicle licensing authority. But some of these vehicle licensing authorities are vast areas. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, who knows the Isle of Wight very well, and my honourable friend the Member for the Isle of Wight, who is our transport spokesman in the other place, will be aware that it is controlled by an area which includes Oxfordshire and Kent. In a situation where there is going to be a lot of movement, a lot of flexibility, a lot of operators coming and going and a lot of changes of timetable&#x2014;how on earth in an area as vast as that can the public possibly be kept up to date with the timetabling within their area? And who is to be responsible for publishing those timetables? The White Paper is silent on this. I believe that with so many operators in such large areas, the information to
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0168"/>
<col>319</col>
the public is going to be absolutely minimal. We face the same sort of fragmentation to which we referred during the passage of the London Regional Transport Bill as being a danger, and, indeed, the danger here is greater because of the reasons referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill.<lb/>
The White Paper proposes that large public undertakings should be broken up. I, too, was fascinated to see that the Scottish Bus Group have been left out of this great carve-up and I just wondered in my mind whether this showed that the Scottish Office was a greater centre of power than the Department of Transport. I do not know. I am sure that if the noble Lord, Lord Ross of Marnock, were here he would disagree with me but I think that there is some sinister activity at work there.<lb/>
Again, to repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, has said, the London position is now totally inconsistent with what is contained in the White Paper. Under the London Regional Transport Bill, the private operators only receive a subsidy if they enter into an agreement with the LRT. So the Government go some way to believing in integration but apparently only where they are responsible, as in the case of London.<lb/>
Let me repeat what I have said before: that in a healthy community transport goes hand in hand with a number of other things, with land-use planning, with housing developments, with recreational and cultural activities. Buses link one part of the city with another, buses link one part of the family with another part of the family, they link the villages with the towns, the villages with the railheads, with the hospitals and with the post offices. And when the Government have allowed sub-post offices in rural areas to be removed, then how are pensioners going to collect their old-age pensions if they cannot get a bus to go into the nearest town? These things are all far too important to be left to chance or to be left to market forces. I say again that I believe that it is a recipe for chaos; I believe it is a recipe by which more people will be forced into using motor-cars and we shall have a further downward spiral in the use of public transport. And, of course, those without cars will have to stay at home.<lb/>
There is no time to deal with many aspects of the White Paper. We have already had a wide-ranging discussion and this is Thursday night and many people wish to get home. My noble friend Lord Attlee will deal with two of the most important aspects which have already been mentioned; that is to say, deregulation and cross subsidy. Suffice it to say from my point of view that I simply do not understand the removal of cross-subsidisation when, at the same time, local government is being controlled by rate-capping. It seems to me that many of the services which at the moment are partly subsidised from the taxpayer and the ratepayer and partly from cross-subsidisation will be squeezed on both sides under the provisions of the White Paper. On the subject of de-regulation the whole conflict between safety and maintenance and many things that Lord Underhill has mentioned are relevant.<lb/>
In addition, there are the problems of unfair competition, the question of people maintaining in
<col>320</col>
lay-bys, the lack of training for operatives, the lack of unionised labour&#x2014;all these may reduce costs but they will produce unfair competition. When that is put alongside the tendering provisions, we see what a nonsense it is. The efficient operating of buses depends on the maximum utilisation of those buses over a whole range of different services. Proper maintenance of buses is simply not economical on a small scale; and there is no guarantee that an operator on an unprofitable route would not face further unfair competition under the tendering system. Further, the duration of the contracts is unclear. Short contracts will discourage investment in new buses. Finally, tendering and de-regulation simply do not go together. If the Government take no other message from this debate or from the papers that have been submitted to them, I hope that they will ponder on that which I believe is a fact.<lb/>
There is another minor item to which I shall refer. It is the commercial operation of bus stations. It is probable that on a cost basis bus stations have never been commercially viable. Therefore, in this situation their existence is threatened. The idea that private operators will construct bus stations seems to me pretty unlikely: the kerbside is an awful lot cheaper.<lb/>
There are many, many other problems. Like the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, if I correctly heard what he said towards the end of his speech, we on these Benches would favour a different approach, which would be to take the existing stage carriage services as a starting point. Many of them have been tailored to suit needs and fairly closely match what the market really needs. And instead of destroying the bus service network, it seems to us it would be preferable that the services should be open to tender on a network basis so that any reputable operator who has an operator's licence and sufficient financial and management resources should be open to tender for the network or for appropriate parts of the network. I think it is down that route that we should be looking rather than towards the fragmentation which is inherent in the Government's proposals.<lb/>
I am deeply worried by the White Paper as it stands. I am deeply worried that it is a recipe, as I have said before, to push people back into motor-cars, to increase congestion on our roads and to continue the downward spiral which is damaging bus services in this country. I do not pretend that nothing needs to be done with bus services&#x2014;clearly it does&#x2014;but this White Paper is not a starting base. I heard a quotation the other day and I am sorry that I cannot tell your Lordships where it comes from; but somebody said of this White Paper that because it was a recipe for the destruction of the bus network, and because it was a recipe for the imprisonment of people in both urban and rural houses who do not have motor-cars, it should be regarded as a White Paper with black edges.</membercontribution></p>

I should also like to take the opportunity of welcoming, as other noble Lords have done, the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon of Tara, who is to answer our
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0169"/>
<col>321</col>
various questions. If I may digress just momentarily, when I was learning to fly many years ago I remember looking with absolute awe at the car of the noble Lord's grandfather which bore the number plate FLY 1&#x2014;because he held the first licence for flying an aircraft in this country&#x2014;and thinking how many people had obtained licences from that moment until the moment that I was making my attempt and wondering whether I would in fact pass. I am sure that the noble Lord will do every bit as well as his grandfather.<lb/>
I should like to start by saying that on many, many aspects I support the Government's overall policy of competition. So long as it remains a principle it may be challenged, and with all good principles, I believe it is important to ensure that the actual application will be for the benefit of our society in each specific case. Thus, I think it is proper that we should interrogate this White Paper since this would appear to be the only point in time that we are going to have the opportunity. Having done so, I am sorry to say that I feel that while in theory it may be academically beyond reproach to some, in practice if it is brought forward as a Bill it may be a total catastrophe.<lb/>
Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, who is so well known on transport matters in your Lordships' House, I am not necessarily known in that way and so perhaps I should say that for a good number of years I have in the past been a lay traffic commissioner for Scotland, and within the realms of local government I was responsible for the Border Region Transport Committee's activities from the time of the reorganisation of local government until mid-1980; and in the latter capacity I served during the whole of that period as a member of the Transport Committee of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. So it is against that background that I speak, and it is in the knowledge, too, that I have never lost contact over the past two years with those with whom I previously worked.<lb/>
I speak necessarily from a Scottish point of view and also to a very large extent from a rural point of view, although I have to admit that I seem to have found on investigation that much of what I have to say has common cause south of the border. So within the time available, I would turn now to the interrogation of the White Paper, and first I should like to speak from the point of view of local government in Scotland. A basic difficulty in the proposals appears to be that they will cause inherent instability. The White Paper states that the proposals:
<quote>"will create new stability and confidence in the provision of rural bus services".</quote>
So perhaps it might be worthwhile having a look at a number of difficulties which may in practice manifest themselves along the road.<lb/>
First, the services which an operator finds to be viable depend very much upon the activities of competitors. The services which are viable at one particular time may be forced into a loss without warning by the introduction of a rival service. The price that a tenderer may bid for a subsidised route may become wholly untenable if a new service is operated over just a small part of that same route. If I may, I am going to be parochial and use the names of towns in my part of Scotland and I ask your Lordships
<col>322</col>
to accept that there will, throughout England and Wales, be exactly similar examples which your Lordships can draw from your own experiences.<lb/>
So as an example I shall take the service between Galashiels, a community of some 18,000 or 19,000 people, and Earlston&#x2014;we call it a village but it is really a great deal larger than that. The service between those two communities is at present just viable to Eastern Scottish, which is a subsidiary of the Scottish Bus Group. But new competition for traffic between any intervening community between those two areas of population would instantly push the service into a loss overnight. The service to Earlston would then require subsidy, and a contract might be let for that route. Then the introduction of any new service between, say, a little village&#x2014;there is nothing to stop it&#x2014;and Melrose, which is the first intermediary town, could destroy all the revenue calculations which the successful tenderer had made, forcing him to re-price or, worse still, to withdraw from the contract. Equally, the cost of operating a service may depend upon the existence of other work for men and vehicles. The loss of this work through a lost tender could result in remaining contracts becoming unworkable. So it seems to me that the proposals, very far from creating new stability and confidence in the provision of rural bus services, will introduce a great deal of instability into our own buses in the rural areas.<lb/>
Secondly, in some rural areas the real competition on tenders may be very limited. In particular, the efficient operation of many long-distance routes will require an operator who has vehicles available at both ends of the route. In these circumstances, one operator may have such a clear advantage over any possible rival as to be effectively free of all competition, which means to say that he could run a service where he wanted and charge what he wanted. At least it can be said at the present moment that the Scottish Bus Group's profit, as determined by the Government, is limited to 4.5 per cent. of its capital assets.<lb/>
Thirdly, in abandoning the network approach there will be less efficient use of men and vehicles. Of that there is no doubt. At the time of SCOTMAP, many deficiencies were identified in the initial "demand network" and additional services were specified by the council. Instead of simply adding these extra services onto the original proposals, Eastern Scottish, with whom we on the Borders work incredibly closely, redesigned the network as a whole, designating each journey to be operated by the man and vehicle best placed to do it. The marginal cost of covering the council's additional requirements proved very low indeed by using this means. As a result, very few routes in the Borders region are operated throughout the week by only one depot, and there will have to be substantial changes in the services provided if viable and non-viable services are to be separated. The separation could, in our view, lead to much less efficiency.<lb/>
Fourthly, in creating increased competition the Government explicitly intend to abolish the practice of cross-subsidisation which has already been frequently referred to and which currently takes place. The White Paper estimates that the value of internal cross-subsidy is between three and five times the value of the local authority revenue support. Yet the paper
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0170"/>
<col>323</col>
suggests that the disappearance of the whole of this hidden subsidy will be offset by greater efficiency. That is the argument&#x2014;greater efficiency. It is interesting to me that it comes at a point in the paper where there is the assertion that, in the assessment of whoever wrote the paper, the Scottish Bus Group, thanks to SCOTMAP, is already exceptionally efficient! So we find ourselves a little bamboozled by that. It seems likely that the effect of eliminating cross-subsidy may be a higher subsidy requirement for the remaining rural services, at least in the area for which I have been responsible in the past. I am not suggesting that over the seven years when I was responsible for these matters we were perfect. No, my Lords. But we achieved something which was workable, good and understood&#x2014;and it still is&#x2014;and to see it ruined would be a great tragedy.<lb/>
Fifthly, the White Paper spends some space in analysing the services which may cease to be viable following the erosion of internal cross-subsidy. As well as rural services, the paper identifies evening services, Sunday services and even some peak period school and work journeys as being most at risk. It is more than likely that on many routes contracted journeys would operate in between commercial services, not necessarily both provided by the same operator. There are also bound to be areas of overlap between two services serving different ultimate destinations, as well as services upon the same road in open competition. No operator is likely to choose to provide information about his competitor's services, so a comprehensive timetable is not likely to be compiled unless it is compiled by the local authority.<lb/>
Similarly, no operator is likely to make his bus station available to his competitors. The Government recognise this problem and are very frank about it. They conclude that:
<quote>"bus stations should be operated whether in public or private ownership on a commercial basis &#x2026; which will provide for all operators to have equal opportunity of gaining access".</quote>
In practice, since it is highly unlikely that we would ever be allowed to charge operators landing fees for the use of a bus station, I think that they will use the streets instead and bus stations, except perhaps for the most prestigious bus stations in big cities, may become a charge on the ratepayer or be abandoned.<lb/>
Finally, on this issue the White Paper recognises that in some areas a network of services is invaluable to the bus user, allowing connections to be reliably provided and through-fares to be offered. It has been an essential aspect of the "social network" of services specified by the local regional councils in Scotland, through SCOTMAP, to secure a large number of connections throughout all and each of the regions. By this means a village, which may have only half a dozen buses a day, may nevertheless have access to a wide range of destinations. The White Paper concedes that through-fares may become impracticable, but suggests that operators might arrange connections for the benefit of their own patrons. There are many circumstances where an operator might well prefer not to do that. For example, an operator who operates his own service from the Borders to Edinburgh once a week may well prefer not to provide connections into a rival's service on the other six days. The experience of my region in
<col>324</col>
recent years is that many important connections have been secured only by the council's insistence that the operators must provide a co-ordinated network.<lb/>
In conclusion, the White Paper admits that the proposals are likely to give rise to additional work for regional council staff, a point which has been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Underhill. They will be required to determine local transport requirements not met by the free market, specify routes for tender, evaluate the bids and monitor the services. This will be a continuing process as the pattern of commercial services changes and contracts fall due for retendering. That is going to cost money. I do not know how much, but it is not going to be cheap. Since local government has been told to keep numbers down to the minimum there is not a great deal, if any, spare time on the hands of those whom we employ. How they are expected to take on these additional burdens I do not know.<lb/>
Those are the local government problems in my region which, I admit, is a rural part of Scotland. I can tell your Lordships that the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are in agreement with practically everything that has been said on behalf of the Association of County Councils and District Councils in England. They do not like this White Paper. I do not know whether their response has been received in London. However, I have seen a draft of their response; they do not like the White Paper.<lb/>
In addition to the fundamental difficulties which I have tried to identify, the White Paper raises one or two detailed practical problems and unanswered questions. I should like quickly to touch upon them. The White Paper proposes that operators would be required to register proposed services with the Traffic Commissioners and to give notice of withdrawal, although a licence would not be required. As any routes which are proposed, or any withdrawals which are to take place could affect the extent of services which the regional council finds it necessary to secure through tender, it is in our view essential that the regional council should also have the right to be notified, as well as the Traffic Commissioners. It is also essential that adequate notice should be given as it will not be possible to arrange tenders and publicity for a change of operator without careful planning and costing. It is our belief that 12 weeks&#x2014;at the very least eight&#x2014;would be required for such an event, even if local public consultation is deemed to be unnecessary.<lb/>
The Traffic Commissioners will have the power to withdraw from an operator the total authority to operate local services if he fails to operate a service as notified. The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, very correctly made the point that the Scottish Bus Group have been left as they are at present, but it is a fearsome thought that if one of their short routes happened to fall foul of the Traffic Commissioners, then the draconian powers that are in fact held by the Traffic Commissioners allow them to take one action only: that is, to close down the whole of the Scottish Bus Group, which would mean that there would be virtually no buses in Scotland outwith the three cities and Greater Glasgow PTE. It is therefore a draconian power. I hope the Government will think very carefully about whether or not there should be a modest intermediate penalty for infringement and about whether the regional councils should be able to
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0171"/>
<col>325</col>
determine whether or not the operators are at fault, because the Traffic Commissioners cannot be expected to know every single route throughout the whole of Scotland.<lb/>
In view of all the problems which will arise from the proposed association between local government and the Traffic Commissioners, speaking as one who has been a lay traffic commissioner for a number of years I wonder whether or not it would be more satisfactory to give these particular responsibilities to the regional councils and perhaps to associate with it the right of appeal to the Traffic Commissioners if there is a dispute.<lb/>
I have one final point to make and I have deliberately left it until last. Chapter 7 of the White Paper deals exclusively with Scotland. Nevertheless, it makes very specific reference to Chapter 3, paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2. Paragraph 3.1 states in heavy black type, under the heading "Safety":
<quote>"This system of supervision will be fully retained and reinforced".</quote>
Paragraph 3.2 states:
<quote>"For this reason it is proposed to strengthen the law to allow new conditions to be attached to licences of operators of local services &#x2026; A high priority will also be given to checks of maintenance facilities and mechanical condition. Additional resources will be provided for that".</quote>
There is an element of <i>d&#x00E9;j&#x00E0; vu</i> in that; those words were used identically four years ago and I can tell your Lordships that they are causing the Traffic Commission chairman of the Scottish traffic area the greatest possible concern. Having been guaranteed, as one would assume from the wording of paragraph 3.2, that additional funds and manpower were to be made available, he has received none. If one were to be absolutely frank about it, both he and my late associates are highly conscious of the fact that in Scotland depot vehicles are already running on the roads which have never been inspected. They do not have either the people or the time to carry out inspections.<lb/>
If we are to take safety seriously, I would ask the noble Lord to ensure that the Government honour this commitment so that if this additional burden is to be placed upon the hardworking staff of the traffic area offices throughout the United Kingdom they will have the opportunity to do their duty, which we owe to society as a whole. There is something absolutely wrong about a public service vehicle carrying fare-paying passengers which has not been inspected in accordance with the law. There is something absolutely wrong about vehicles, having been weighed&#x2014;as they have been since 1982&#x2014;and weighed and weighed again never being inspected because it takes too long. Both the National Bus Company in England and the Scottish Bus Group in Scotland are fairly regularly inspected because their depots are known, but where they are not known there is nothing we can do about it. It is placing far too great a burden upon them. We in this House should make sure that it is taken from their backs, for in the end we are responsible for the safety of our fellow citizens.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01616"><member>Lord Mottistone</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, would like to congratulate my noble friend Lord Teviot both for
<col>326</col>
introducing this Question and for the very careful preliminary work he undertook in order to advise himself on the background to the White Paper. I would also like to welcome my noble friend Lord Brabazon who is to reply, and congratulate him on his new post. I am afraid that I have to say to your Lordships and to my noble friend on the Front Bench that, owing to a long-standing engagement and the delays which have attended this debate, it may be that I shall not be able to wait until the end of it. I hope your Lordships will forgive me.<lb/>
I have been advised in particular by the Isle of Wight County Council and the National Association of Local Councils&#x2014;the latter body of which I have the honour to be a vice-president. I must tell your Lordships that my advisers&#x2014;as have all noble Lords who have spoken so far&#x2014;fear the worst from the proposals. However, I welcome the broad intentions of the White Paper. In particular, I am impressed by the arguments in Chapter 4 that the road service licensing devised for the 1930s is now outdated, especially since motor-car usage dramatically increased in the 1950s and 1960s. I remember that in the late 1920s, when buses first started running in my part of the Isle of Wight, and up until the war&#x2014;which were the early days of road service licensing&#x2014;the bus services we had in those days were infinitely better than anything we have had since. In fact, the bus services are not good now.<lb/>
Whether this White Paper is the best way of putting that situation right is a matter of opinion. But to go rumbling on the way we do now, because of all the fears which people have about the White Paper, seems to me not to be good enough; something has to be done. This is a good starting point. It seems to me that the experience of de-regulation of coach services leading to a 40 per cent. fare reduction and the addition of new services&#x2014;and whether they number 700 as the White Paper says or 10 per cent. of that figure, which my noble friend Lord Teviot suggests is a more accurate estimate, does not matter because there are more services&#x2014;is convincing. My noble friend would not make that particular point, but it is a convincing one.<lb/>
Although I have not been to Hereford, the benefits as stated in the White Paper of competitive tendering for subsidy in the Hereford trial area certainly seem clear as I read it. The trouble is that noble Lords who have spoken from whatever Benches are all fearful of something new. In some cases, it is distrust and dislike of the market forces; one recognises this fear in the noble Lord, Lord Underhill, although one is perhaps surprised to hear it expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff. The fact is that in the market place, surely, supply will&#x2014;given a reasonable hand&#x2014;automatically meet demand. The fears which everybody has expressed may well be misplaced.<lb/>
I am conscious that those fears are to some extent inspired by the people who will have to operate the new system. I fear that people have grown so used to the centralisation and regulation we have had imposed upon us for the past 50 years that they will naturally be against any new system and will not operate it as effectively as they should. To that extent, the Government have to think very carefully about how they do things. But I believe the basic principle behind what they are trying to do is the right one.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0172"/>
<col>327</col>
That is particularly so when one considers the care they have taken to supplement their main proposal of de-regulation with many practical safegaurds. These include tighter quality and safety standards for both vehicles and operators. The noble Earl, Lord Minto, states that for other reasons there is not enough money to pay for that. Maybe, as one sees the situation at the moment, there is not&#x2014;but if the Government say this is something that will have to be, they cannot make totally irresponsible recommendations without having checked them out with the Treasury in some way. I hope I am right, otherwise they really are into trouble. I have a natural inclination to trust the Government which I support to get that sort of thing right. I would trust any Government to get it right and not just the one I support. It is perhaps over-fearful to assume that safety standards will not be achieved.<lb/>
There is recognition that some services must be subsidised and that such subsidies should be competitively tendered for in order to make it as economic as possible. That seems also to be reasonable. There is recognition, too, of the need for continuation of concessionary fares. I would agree that there is a need&#x2014;although naturally noble Lords who like centralisation would not do so&#x2014;for greater effectiveness; that we need to split up and privatise the National Bus Company. There is a great deal of evidence that over-centralised bodies are naturally inefficient and that large bodies&#x2014;whether they are private enterprise or centally controlled&#x2014;are themselves naturally inefficient, too. I would have thought that was a reasonable approach to work to.<lb/>
Above all, there are to be special provisions to foster rural transport including&#x2014;and no noble Lords have mentioned this&#x2014;encouragement of the joint use of services run by educational, health and social services and the post office. All of this is very practical and these proposals make a welcome addition to the points which appear in the White Paper. I personally think that the White Paper is on the right lines.<lb/>
However, there are some points on which I would like to seek further explanation and which, if not met properly, could be detrimental to the main intentions which the Government express in the White Paper. The first of these concerns the apparent intention that county councils&#x2014;while still remaining the highway authority and responsible for roads and their safety&#x2014;will have a reduced role in running the new system. It is not clear to me from the White Paper just where the responsibilities of the licensing authority, the traffic commissioners and the county council will begin and end. It is rather obscure.<lb/>
Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, made the point that it would be disastrous to have transport in the Isle of Wight run by a body which looked after the mainland, from Oxford to Kent. But I believe that since the White Paper was issued&#x2014;and perhaps since the noble Lord had that information and I did, too&#x2014;it has been agreed that county councils will be responsible for bus service registration and not the traffic commissioners. If that is so, it is most welcome. I hope that my noble friend on the Front Bench will be able to confirm that it is so when he comes to reply.<lb/>
<col>328</col>
There are two features of transport operation which are peculiar to the Isle of Wight, with its separation by sea from England. First, our county council needs and has the powers to co-ordinate rail, boat and bus timetables; and it has powers to integrate the services of those three transport systems, which operate through four ports. As an example, the county council recently had occasion successfully to use its powers with regard to a proposed new train time at Portsmouth. As a result of the county council using those powers, the new time was not introduced, because it did not match up with the boat times. It will need to retain the same powers for the co-ordination of timetables and for the integration of services in relation to buses as it possesses at present. I should be grateful if my noble friend on the Front Bench could confirm that these sort of powers will be retained in relation to bus services.<lb/>
Secondly, and this is even more special to the Isle of Wight, or any island for that matter, the bus "market place" in the island is relatively small and, unlike a mainland county, competition from adjacent counties is impracticable. Thus, it is particularly important that a monopoly, unregulated operator does not develop without restraint on charges. If it did, the county council, as the greatest single passenger transport customer by virtue of the transport provisions of the 1944 Education Act, would be the greatest sufferer&#x2014;as indeed, in consequence, would be its ratepayers.<lb/>
Currently the overall Isle of Wight network is profitable in the summer and loss-making in the winter. Differential pricing has enhanced summer profits leading to lower winter fares and reduced revenue support. This had led to the cost of school buses being about 66 per cent. of those on mainland counties. It would be paradoxical if the Government's efforts to achieve a more cost effective bus system overall led unintentionally to increased costs in the Isle of Wight due to the development of an uncontrolled monopoly operator because, owing to the sea, it is not possible for competition to come in from outside the island. I should be grateful if my noble friend could ask his right honourable friend to watch this particular point with great care. I do not necessarily expect him to comment now.<lb/>
In conclusion, by way of illustrating what the White Paper may achieve, a recent report in our local press of the views of the manager of Southern Vectis, which is the Isle of Wight local subsidiary of the National Bus Company, brought out all the fears that he naturally had about the White Paper proposals. However, the report stated that three mini-buses would soon be joining the Southern Vectis fleet, experimentally, as part of the company's moves to combat competition when introduced in 1986. Other moves reported included shutting down a bus station in one town and reducing administrative staff.<lb/>
All these actions have been taken at the mere sight of the White Paper. How many more economies will result from actual legislation? All this can be only for the benefit of the customers and is a welcome forerunner for the economies that will follow. So I say, "well done!" to the Government for their proposals. There is need for something new, but when the proposals are introduced or turned into legislation I

ask the Government not to forget that the Isle of Wight has its own particular problems because it is cut off from the mainland by sea.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01618"><member>Earl Attlee</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the more one studies this White Paper the more one studies the expert, reasoned and logical arguments against some of its main conclusions and proposals. In fact, in today's debate, with the exception of the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, as one listens to what your Lordships have been saying there is only one conclusion that can be drawn&#x2014;that all the Government are doing in this White Paper is pursuing their doctrinaire and blinkered policy of privatisation which in this White Paper is masquerading as deregulation.<lb/>
This will have the same dire results, I am afraid, as when the Socialists pursued their doctrinaire and blinkered policies of nationalisation regardless. The ideas in the White Paper are, for the most part, ill thought-out. Even the Government described the main document as a White Paper with green edges and my noble friend Lord Tordoff interprets it as a White Paper with black edges. The White Paper even admits that,
<quote>"systems of large-scale, planned public sector networks can indeed produce high quality services and connections".</quote>
Surely this is an amazing admission to make, especially when the White Paper deliberately sets out to destroy that very system. Does this statement not indicate, at the very least, that there were some differences of opinion within the Department of Transport?<lb/>
In my view, the linchpin of the White Paper is deregulation in order to achieve the abolition of cross-subsidies. Why? Taking deregulation first, the White Paper claims, or implies, that public sector bus undertakings, and others, are wasteful, inefficient, oversubsidised, and/or artificially protected from competition. Deregulation will, we are assured, encourage and increase competition&#x2014;as if, apart from that engendered by the 1980 Transport Act, there were no competition at present from private cars, local trains, both surface and underground, taxis, hire cars, cycling and even walking.<lb/>
What else does the White Paper claim will be the benefits of deregulation? It claims that it will lead to improvements in service to the public and improvements in financial control&#x2014;things which, given the widely varying operating conditions, will be almost impossible to achieve. The White Paper gives great emphasis to two of the trial areas of deregulation&#x2014;Hereford and Worcester. It points out proudly that in these two trial areas subsidies have fallen and fares have been reduced. There has even been some innovation. What the White Paper fails to mention is that, as predicted, part of the rural network has ceased altogether to exist, that there have been poor standards of vehicle maintenance and safety and that the much-trumpeted lower fares seem unlikely to last very much longer. Those are the two trial areas that are used to show the benefits of deregulation. If the White Paper had come clean on the other trial areas I wonder how much worse would the picture have been?<lb/>
<col>330</col>
Turning to the abolition of cross-subsidies, which is, as I have already said, one of the main aims of deregulation, why are the Government against them? The Government claim that it is because it is unfair that passengers on busy routes should pay more than necessary and have less frequent services in order to support highly uneconomic services elsewhere which are sparsely used. Quite honestly, to make such claims shows an abysmal lack of knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the importance and necessity of cross-subsidies.<lb/>
If profitable services were open to competition it is true that fares would fall&#x2014;at least in the short term&#x2014;but with the result that the availability of cross-subsidies for supporting loss-making services would cease; and if cross-subsidies were abolished fares would vary from route to route and from time to time. This is because cross-subsidies exist even between various sections of the same route; between different times of the day; between weekdays and weekends; and, of course, between different times of the year. With no cross-subsidies children's cheap fares would be threatened, since, unlike old-age pensioners' fares, they are funded by the operator and not from local government contributions. I must admit that I am not quite sure at the moment what is the position with regard to school buses for children. Perhaps the Minister can answer that in his reply.<lb/>
But these are not the only effects of deregulation and the abolition of cross-subsidies. For instance, where an operator provides a subsidised service under contract to a local authority, he will have no protection against another operator skimming the cream off that same route by operating only in those areas where all the profit is to be made. Operators will be forced to cut costs. One way undoubtedly would be to work a single-shift system, so that the buses would operate from, say, eight in the morning until six in the evening. This will affect a lot of people&#x2014;and I mean a lot&#x2014;as some 16 million people travel by bus. How will those people fare?<lb/>
For a start, there will be no comprehensive timetables&#x2014;that is if there are any timetables at all! There will be an embarrassing surfeit of competing buses on some routes, or sections of a route&#x2014;those, of course, that are profitable. But outside these, and especially in rural areas, there will be little or no service, and when there is one it will be spasmodic. On all routes and in all areas a service will almost certainly be restricted in duration each day, especially in holiday and tourist areas&#x2014;and that was the point which I believe was made by the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone&#x2014;where the traffic is seasonal.<lb/>
The travelling public will suffer in other ways. Buses will not be scheduled to fit in with other modes of transport such as trains, unless of course it happens to suit the bus operator for that to be done. The public will suffer, and so will British Rail.<lb/>
Also because of competition and attempts by competitors to cream off the profitable traffic, the cash simply will not be available for investment in new buses. As a result, old type buses, usually with high platforms, several steps and difficult entry and exit will be retained, especially if their running costs are lower than those of a modern bus. That will adversely affect the elderly, the infirm, the disabled, women with
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0174"/>
<col>331</col>
young children and those with shopping to take home from the shops. Equally important, and as has already been shown in the trial area and has been mentioned by several noble Lords, maintenance and safety standards will inevitably fall.<lb/>
This state of affairs cannot be what the travelling public wants or deserves. The runaway success of travelcards, which provide interchange and through-travel among various modes of transport for a single payment, shows what the public wants. What the public wants is what my noble friend Lord Tordoff and I, among others, stressed time and time again when the London Regional Transport Bill was going through your Lordships' House; that is, an integrated public transport system. If the Government had deliberately set out to devise a means of denying them this, it is most unlikely that they could have come up with a more effective method of doing so than the proposals contained in this White Paper.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01620"><member>Lord Mountevans</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, should like to open by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, for creating the opportunity this afternoon for us to debate the White Paper on buses. I found his speech most illuminating. I can only hope that it has the same influence on the Government as it certainly had on my thinking this afternoon. I am a taxpayer, a ratepayer and a fare-payer. I am a non-motorist. I use public transport, and at the end of the day, howsoever the money gets to the bus companies, I pay.<lb/>
I appreciate that there is a need for the Government to obtain value for their money and to continue to seek to obtain such value, but I feel that the White Paper gives too high a priority to that factor or objective at the expense of the public need, as I conceive it. While duplication and waste exist in our public systems, and particularly in our bus systems, it is right that they should be reduced. It would be meaningless if the system, far from being enhanced, was in fact destroyed by the means which we seek to use or which the Government's White Paper suggests.<lb/>
The White Paper quotes 39 per cent. of households as having no regular use of a car. I believe that in areas of Glasgow that figure rises to over 80 per cent. It is to the needs of that 39 per cent., or variously 80 per cent., that the White Paper should be addressing itself. Their need is for transport&#x2014;transport to work, for leisure purposes, for education, for health reasons and for a vast number of other reasons. Their need is for an integrated public transport system, as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, has been saying and as other noble Lords have said before him, not just today, but on many occasions&#x2014;a system that interrelates rail and road rather than fragments them (and particularly the latter) by breaking down, as the White Paper proposed, the National Bus Company and the PTEs. Systems should&#x2014;in fact, must&#x2014;be marketed as a whole. The product must operate as a whole. It must connect; it must have interchanges; it must be convenient to use; it must be attractive. It must be sufficiently attractive to drive people out of their cars and persuade them to leave their cars at home.<lb/>
One has only to look&#x2014;again as the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, mentioned&#x2014;at the success of the travelcard to
<col>332</col>
realise that, if the system is put together and sold as an entity, it will inevitably attract greater patronage and greater revenue, and thus there will be a lesser need for subsidy. One must be aware of the success that travelcards have been in London. When one thinks of London, one must then think of the guidelines issued this summer by the Secretary of State to London Regional Transport and to British Rail. He urged both those bodies to explore all opportunities for closer co-operation both in services and in fares, integrating and connecting their services and having through ticketing. They were urged to move together. They were not urged towards duplication and disintegration, which is the direction in which, I suggest, the White Paper is leading us.<lb/>
The White Paper's detail on services, deregulation and tendering has already been severely criticised by almost all previous speakers. I shall not rehearse their arguments. I found myself nodding agreement on a great number of occasions. I should rather put some questions to the Minister. I accept that the White Paper is on buses, but why are there only two references to rail (one on page 13 and the other on page 23) before one gets to the annexures? Are the Government suggesting that rail and road can be treated in isolation, one from another? As they are committed to continue direct or indirect subsidy of both modes of transport&#x2014;in fact of practically everything that runs on wheels in this country, save the national bus long-distance network&#x2014;should they not be using their muscle as the largest individual customer to pull public transport together in order to meet the needs of the customer, rather than fragmenting it in order to meet the requirements of political dogma?<lb/>
I should like to ask the Government whether they have looked at practices elsewhere in Europe. I do not believe that one should argue that what is good for Norway is necessarily good for us or that what works in Berlin will work in London. But if I go to Oslo, I can get a timetable which lists every public transport service provided by the community, Oslo Tramways or by the people whom it employs to provide bus services. All the fares interrelate. If I decide to go outside Oslo, I can obtain a timetable listing every public transport service operating in Norway. I can look at the timetable that relates to trains from Oslo to the far north, to take me to a given station. At that station there will be an entry in the timetable referring to all the buses that serve that given station. If I get off at that station, take a bus to the end of the road and find myself in the fjords, what will I find if I consult the timetable? I shall find that the ferries that run are also referred to. I will not say that all the services run to a common tariff, but they run to tariffs that are broadly based and similar. All services are subsidised by the Government, who can direct the level of service to be provided and also the fares to be charged.<lb/>
I am not saying that this is the best way to go about things in this country, but I should like to know what the Government have done about looking at the position in other countries. As subsidised bus services must be subjected to competitive tender, I ask myself what happens if there is no tender. I pick this point up from proposal 2.4, which refers to many essential bus
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0175"/>
<col>333</col>
routes. Where do we go if a service is essential and there is no tender?<lb/>
I should also like to know to what extent National will be divided into so-called free standing parts, how many parts there will be, and whether it is really necessary to divide it at all. It is already divided into autonomous regions. I am quite sure that the directors of these autonomous regions will fight their corners with just as much tenacity as the directors of the British Rail sectors are now beginning to do.<lb/>
I should like to ask the Minister this. Do the Government believe that under proposal 2.7 the PTES, which have been deemed essential by speakers this afternoon and legislated for by the Government not so long ago, have a future, or that rail has any part of that future? Is Section 20 of the 1968 Act to become an irrelevance?<lb/>
Finally, may I ask the noble Lord the Minister to confirm that the views of professional operators in the bus industry will be fully considered before legislation is tabled? It is they, not I or the Government, who are the experts who will have to live with the eventual Act.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01622"><member>Lord Ferrier</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, anybody who has listened to this debate will appeciate that the problem to which my noble friend Lord Teviot addressed himself is a very complex one. It is extremely complex in every possible way. Therefore, your Lordships will be glad to hear that I propose to make only the shortest possible contribution because I am concentrating on only one point. It is a point which has been touched on already by my noble friend Lord Mottistone. It is the importance to the possibility of saving and improving the service to people in remote areas, of the sharing of the existing transport systems. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, also mentioned the matter.<lb/>
I am thinking particularly of Scotland, where there is many a glen in which the little red car coming up with the newspapers and the mail is, other than perhaps the odd shepherd's Land Rover, the only vehicle that passes that way in a day. I urge upon the Government to concentrate on the points they make in this White Paper, particularly in Chapter 7, on providing ahead for the possibilities of sharing with existing transport. By that I mean this. You can look ahead now at the problems of the design of vehicles. If, as I believe, the time is not far off when the postal people will be able to take their passengers, then their existing vehicles must be designed to suit the extra one or two passengers.<lb/>
The trade unions, and the labour concerned with the operation of such services, and the security of the same, must be consulted. Insurance and the like must be considered. For that reason I make so bold as to say that a lot of ingenuity can be applied to the design of vehicles which will suit the Highland glen and other remote places.<lb/>
I say this with some hesitation. The day may not be far off when the electric vehicle will be a viable unit. Together with the development of regenerative braking, that might be helpful for use in hilly areas. Perhaps a word might be said to the Hydro Board to see if they can make any contribution.<lb/>
<col>334</col>
However, any suggestion in regard to the Post Office is not the only one because, as my noble friend Lord Mottistone said, there are other vehicles that travel that way. So I think it is important that the "powers that be" in remote areas apply themselves to producing a system whereby, whether by subsidy, by authorising the sharing of fares, or by some sort of support to hire cars or the like, the public will be provided with transport so that the fears of the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, may not come to pass in that everybody is going to be driven back to the motor-car.<lb/>
The other points that I have in mind have already been made by other speakers but my sole contribution is concerning ingenuity and foresight as to the future of the sharing of transport in rural areas.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01624"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should very much like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, for introducing this Question. I welcome this opportunity to debate the Government's proposals on buses which were set out in the White Paper published in July. It is a subject to which I do not claim to bring the personal knowledge which my noble friend Lord Teviot and several other noble Lords have on this subject. Nevertheless, in the short time I have held my present responsibilities, I have come to recognise the great importance of our proposals, particularly to the many millions of people in both urban and rural areas who use this form of public transport. As the White Paper said, "Britain needs good bus services". Over 10 per cent. of all journeys are made by bus and three-quarters of those journeys are for essential purposes&#x2014;work, school, business and shopping. Our aim is to set the industry free so that it can give a better service to the passenger and better value for money to the ratepayer and taxpayer. We are currently considering responses to the White Paper and consulting widely on the details of our proposals on the basis of seven consultation documents. We intend to bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity.<lb/>
Before answering some of the specific points raised by noble Lords, may I explain briefly the background to the Government's policy and describe some of our proposals in more detail. Local bus services have been subject to the present highly restrictive licensing regime for more than fifty years. Between them the Traffic Commissioners and the local authorities&#x2014;with the very best of intentions&#x2014;have used their powers of regulation and subsidy to shape the services provided in their areas without the benefit of genuine competition. The result has been an industry which has failed to adapt to the needs of the customer. The industry has come to be dominated by relatively few public sector operators, many of which do not even purport to be commercially orientated organisations.<lb/>
The present system has not served the customer well. Bus fares increased by 30 per cent. above the rate of inflation between 1972 and 1982. Revenue support for the industry increased from &#x00A3;10 million in 1972 to over &#x00A3;500 million in 1982&#x2014;a thirteen-fold increase in real terms. Total support for the industry is estimated at over &#x00A3;900 million for 1984&#x2013;85. Yet at the same time services have declined and in some areas have become non-existent.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0176"/>

The present bus licensing system was in fact originally devised for a totally different era. The 1920s were a period of growth for bus services. Fares remained stable and operators made money. Study of the official papers during those years now shows that the 1930 legislation was devised primarily to keep the number of services to a minimum in the interests of safety. But, as times changed, the belief grew up that the way to provide a comprehensive public transport system was to use the licensing system to protect operators on their profitable routes so that these could cross-subsidise the unprofitable ones. The system positively encouraged the development of large public sector operators unresponsive to the needs of the customer and the maintenance of existing patterns of service with little incentive to develop new markets.<lb/>
Since the mid-1950s the system has in effect prevented the industry making the rapid adjustments which were necessary if it was to continue to meet the demands of the travelling public. The result has been a disastrous cycle of rising costs, rising fares and reducing services. Previous governments have recognised the debilitating effect of the road service licensing system and have tried to do something about it. In 1980 this Government decided that the time had come to deregulate long distance coach services and allow county councils to set up trial areas in which road service licensing for local bus services would be abolished. Many of your Lordships will recall the strength of opposition to those measures. Yet we now know that fares on long distance services have dropped on average by 40 per cent. in real terms and many new services have been introduced.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Teviot has described the developments in one of the three areas where local councils took the opportunity to deregulate local services. There has been no massive decline in services in these rural areas as many predicted in 1980. Indeed, the evidence is that rural services in the trial areas have done rather better than in the country as a whole. Nor have the county councils had to provide increases in subsidies to offset the loss of cross-subsidy. In Hereford and Worcester, the council is paying 40 per cent. less subsidy on rural services. Moreover, in Hereford town, bus services have increased and fares have gone down. This is a far cry from the transport deserts we were promised at the time of the 1980 Act.<lb/>
That is the background. I now turn to our proposals in detail. We intend to abolish road service licensing throughout Great Britain except in London, where major changes are already under way. I want to emphasise that safety standards will be maintained. The system of operator licensing that supervises the quality and safety standards of public service vehicles and operation will be retained and tightened. I hope that that answers one or two of the questions, and particularly the <i>Guardian</i> article, which I had read.<lb/>
Opponents of our proposals have pointed to problems in Hereford when small private operators have attempted stage carriage work, working their vehicles all day long in urban conditions. But the Hereford situation demonstrates precisely that the present system is working and can ensure that proper standards are maintained. Problems have not occurred in the Devon and Norfolk trial areas nor as a
<col>336</col>
result of deregulation of the express and excursion and tours market in 1980. Operator licensing already copes with some 5,500 indpendent operators of buses and coaches. As a whole, the private sector owns 30,000 vehicles. Over many years the private sector has maintained high safety standards. Only a very small number of operators have caused concern, and the system has dealt with them.<lb/>
As well as ensuring safety standards, we also propose to protect the public from operators who fail to provide the services that they have undertaken to run. To achieve this, there will be a registration process. It will not be possible for a registration to be refused but all local services will have to be registered and the operator will then be required to run the service registered. This will provide the public with a reasonable degree of certainty. There will be appropriate periods of notice before a service can be introduced, varied or withdrawn.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Mottistone and the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, were concerned about the remoteness of the body registering services, particularly in the case of the Isle of Wight. We, of course, recognise that local authorities will need access to registrations. We are considering whether PTEs, county councils in England and Wales and regional councils in Scotland should themselves be the registration authorities. But no decision has yet been taken. This is something on which we are still consulting.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01625"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord on his first appearance at the Dispatch Box. It seems to me, however, that the question of registration does not solve the problem of someone who tenders for a service and then goes bust. The fact that he is registered and therefore has an obligation to provide it in no way stops him going bankrupt and having to withdraw the service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01626"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take the point that the noble Lord has made. I think that I may have a reply to it when I come to my more detailed answers. The effect of removing road service licensing will give the bus industry its head. It will allow operators to test the market by seeing whether people want different services and at what price. It will allow operators to show what they can really do. There will be fare reductions on well-used services and passengers can expect more frequent buses on busy routes. It will introduce the competitive spur to efficiency and lead to innovation. The bus industry will begin to recapture some of the traffic which has been drifting away to other forms of transport. At long last, the best routes will be cultivated and developed.<lb/>
To come back to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, it can already happen now that a company can go bust in the middle of its operations. Deregulation will, of course, expose those services which are not viable. This was a point that my noble friend Lord Teviot made. However, under our proposals, local authorities will continue to be able to subsidise services that would cease in a free market. But, instead of subsidising whole networks of services some parts of which are profitable and some parts of which are not, the subsidy will be paid specifically to the non-commercial services. That might be rural
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0177"/>
<col>337</col>
services, evenings, Sundays, or whatever. The authority will specify its requirements and invite tenders from operators to provide those services. The authority will then accept the tender which offers the best value for money.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Teviot and other noble Lords&#x2014;in fact, nearly all noble Lords&#x2014;have raised the question of cross-subsidy. They have argued that, without the benefit of cross-subsidy from the commercially viable services, authorities will have to increase the total amount of subsidy they pay if they are to maintain the level of services in their areas or, in the case that my noble friend Lord Mottistone cited, maintain the level of services outside the peak holiday season. But that is to ignore the major effect of deregulation on costs. The White Paper talks of a potential for cost reduction of up to 30 per cent. While many public sector operators will dispute that figure, there is general agreement that costs will fall, and by a substantial amount, as the trial areas demonstrated. This will mean that many services which are at the moment unprofitable will become profitable and in others the amount of support needed will fall.<lb/>
In rural areas, operators will be able to start new services without the fear of objection from entrenched subsidised public sector operators. Local taxi and car hire companies will be able to move in and provide more cost effective solutions in some places. Competitive tendering will ensure that what subsidy is available will support more services than before. We shall be encouraging further development of community buses and post buses and the like through our new innovation grant, which will amount to &#x00A3;1 million a year in England with comparable sums for Scotland and Wales. In addition, in recognition of the special problems of rural areas, we shall be providing a new rural grant of &#x00A3;20 million in the first years, reducing by even steps in subsequent years to cover the transitional period when cross-subsidy is reduced and until competition has its full effect on costs.<lb/>
So I do not accept that loss of cross-subsidy will have the disastrous consequences for the non-commercial services which many now predict. As I explained earlier, this has not happened in the trial areas. Our proposals will ensure that subsidy goes to the route or service where it is needed rather than as part of a blanket subsidy to a whole network. Competitive tendering will ensure better value for money.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, and several noble Lords raised the question of concessionary fare schemes. Let me make it clear that we support sensible concessionary fare schemes. We want to ensure that all operators, not just publicly-owned ones, are able to participate in such schemes. Local authorities will be placed under a duty to make the concessions that they provide available on an equal basis to any licensed operator who runs an eligible service and who wishes to participate in the scheme. We are currently consulting on the detailed measures which will be needed to implement this.<lb/>
The present structure of the bus industry, dominated as it is by large public sector operators&#x2014;the passenger transport executives, the municipal bus companies and the National Bus Company&#x2014;is not conducive to the introduction of effective competition.
<col>338</col>
The size and financial strength, and in some cases the blanket subsidy these operators receive, would, unless checked, give them market dominance which could thwart the development of new operators and new services which we want to see. This is why we are proposing that the bus operations of the PTEs should be broken down into smaller units and turned into companies; that bus undertakings of district councils should be incorporated into companies; and that the board of the National Bus Company should have a duty to reorganise the company, in consultation with the Secretary of State, into parts which can be disposed of as free standing companies. We believe these measures&#x2014;which in many cases simply build on changes already being implemented by the authorities concerned&#x2014;will provide the right structure for bus managers to operate commercially and take advantage of new opportunities. And they will clarify the operation and financial relationships with the local authorities, so that no one operator has unfair access to public funds.<lb/>
Finally, I should mention our proposals on taxis and hire cars. First, let me emphasise that we are not proposing to make any fundamental change to the way classic taxi and hire car services are provided. We do, however, propose to relax progressively the restriction on the number of taxis which operate in some areas. It is important to ensure an adequate supply of taxis, and research has shown that tight quantity restrictions on taxis tend merely to encourage the expansion of the private hire car trade.<lb/>
Our main proposal on taxis and hire cars is to allow them to carry passengers at separate fares. We believe this could result in a much wider use of taxis and hire cars as an integral part of public transport. With the decline in bus use there are simply too few passengers in some areas to support a conventional bus service. Taxis might be used to reinstate services already withdrawn, or to maintain socially desirable services at lower cost to local authorities. It is not our intention to require all taxis and hire cars to enter this field, but simply to remove the legislative barriers to them doing so. No doubt taxis and hire cars will continue to be primarily engaged in meeting the demand for exclusive services, and nothing we are doing will prevent them doing so.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Minto, and my noble friend Lord Ferrier raised the particular problems of bus services in Scotland. Broadly the same problems exist in Scotland and broadly the same remedies are appropriate. The problems of rural areas in Scotland are particularly acute. The transitional grant to operators of rural services will extend to Scotland, as will rural innovation grant to encourage new ways of meeting rural transport needs. There is particular scope for use of vehicles owned by education authorities&#x2014;as my noble friend Lord Ferrier said&#x2014;health and social work authorities, the Post Office and private firms. In urban areas the benefits of competition will be substantial both for the consumer and the ratepayer.<lb/>
I now turn to a number of detailed points which noble Lords have raised. The noble Lords, Lord Underhill and Lord Tordoff, asked why London was being excluded from the White Paper. We do not say that deregulation would not work in London, only that
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0178"/>
<col>339</col>
we should first see through the great changes which have only recently been introduced there. Changes to road service licensing in London will bring a measure of competition there in the meantime.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Mottistone&#x2014;and my noble friend Lord Teviot also mentioned this matter&#x2014;raised the question of the future role of the county councils in co-ordinating public transport. What we are proposing is that councils will no longer have a duty to co-ordinate public transport&#x2014;that would not be compatible with allowing free competition. But councils will still have general powers to talk to operators of commercial and non-commercial services, provide information for passengers; and promote co-operation between operators where this is commercially sensible and provided competition is not restricted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01627"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord, but does that mean that the system of transport policies and programmes is going to be abolished in future? Will that be in the Bill as well?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01628"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall have to ask the noble Lord to wait and see the Bill. All we have at present is the White Paper, and as your Lordships know, there is a considerable amount of consultation still going on.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Underhill, and the noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, mentioned the Scottish Bus Group and asked why it was being treated differently from the National Bus Company. The Scottish Bus Group is a very different company from the National Bus Company and it operates in a different market. It is a smaller company; it operates more distinctly in rural areas; and it is currently reorganising itself. However, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will, of course, continue to watch the competitive situation in Scotland to ensure that competition is allowed to emerge.<lb/>
Several noble Lords mentioned travel cards, through-ticketing, interchange arrangements and timetables. It is too early to say precisely what will be the effect of competition on any particular fare or ticketing scheme. Some will prove to be commercially viable and will continue following deregulation. If their existence attracts custom, operators will wish to go on providing them. But where fare schemes are achieved at high cost to both the taxpayers and ratepayers as well as to passengers paying hidden cross-subsidy, that cost will be exposed by competition.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Mottistone raised the question of monopoly as regards the Isle of Wight&#x2014;a subject which also concerns me. My noble friend argued the case for the Isle of Wight and suggested that operators from adjoining areas may be less likely to compete with the existing local bus service operator. But even in a relatively small market such as the Isle of Wight there must be in existence other bus operators or, for example, taxi firms which would be interested in coming forward. Certainly if the existing operator tried to exploit his position in the market, others would come in to undercut him.<lb/>
<col>340</col>
The noble Lord, Lord Tordoff, and the noble Earl, Lord Minto, asked about our proposals on bus stations. I should make it clear that all we are seeking to do is to prevent bus operators who control access to particular bus stations from behaving in an anticompetitive way by deliberately ensuring that other operators cannot gain access to that station. I take the point that to require local authorities to operate bus stations commercially in every case may not be the right solution where local authorities wish to encourage operators to use the bus station to ease congestion on the streets. We are looking further at this matter.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, asked about the effect of our proposals on rail services, particularly in the case of the PTEs which subsidise local rail services. Those powers to subsidise rail services will not be affected by our proposals, but passengers will be free to choose what form of transport suits them best. Rail will no doubt continue to attract passengers and revenue support.<lb/>
The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked about school buses. The arrangements for school buses are not covered by the proposals in the White Paper, but of course many local authorities already go out to competitive tender for school bus services. The noble Lord, Lord Mountevans, also asked whether I could give him any details of the break-up of the National Bus Company. I cannot at this stage give any details.<lb/>
I hope that I have answered all the questions that have been raised. I hope that I have explained why the Government believe that fundamental reforms are necessary and will bring great benefits. I hope that I have also shown that we have an open mind on many of the detailed questions of implementation. That is why we are consulting. The detailed points that have been made this evening are a helpful part of that process and I know that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State will be studying this debate with great interest.<lb/>
The time has come to end the 30 years of decline in the bus industry. We must move into a new era in which the main services will not only continue, but the standard of service will improve and fares will be reduced; other services will evolve to meet the needs of the community more effectively; the taxpayer and the ratepayer will get better value for money; and there will be scope for innovation and new types of services. Under our proposals we can look forward to a future where passengers determine the services that they want.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NATO</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01643"><member>Lord Boothby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01644">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01645">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are satisfied that NATO, upon which we, depend ultimately for our survival, is now functioning satisfactorily.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01646"><member>The Lord President of the Council (Viscount Whitelaw)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before I answer the noble Lord's Question, perhaps I may refer to the fact that it was exactly 60 years ago today that the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, was first elected as a Member of another place. Since then he has been continuously a Member of one or other House of Parliament and I hope that I am not out of order in offering the noble Lord the congratulations and good wishes of the House on a notable parliamentary anniversary.<lb/>
The Answer to the noble Lord's Question is yes. The Alliance has safeguarded peace in the North Atlantic area and the freedom of its members for 35 years. It remains in excellent health. I am confident that the Alliance will continue successfully to provide the foundation for our security in future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01647"><member>Lord Boothby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Viscount the Leader of the House very much indeed for what he has said about me. I should also like to take the opportunity to thank your Lordships in all parts of the House for your kindness to me over the last 25 years. I must confess that I am quite pleased that I have sat in one House or the other for 60 unbroken years.<lb/>
I should now like to put a supplementary question to the noble Viscount the Leader of the House. Does the noble Viscount agree that the sheer pace of modern technological development makes it difficult and rather dangerous to define so-called conventional weapons, and, even more, to try to differentiate between conventional weapons and nuclear weapons? Conventional weapons are now developing at such a pace that they very nearly outstrip the so-called nuclear weapons. If they were ever used, they would do such damage to the world and to their targets as is almost unthinkable. Does the noble Viscount agree that, by seeming to make another war waged by conventional weapons okay and all right, the advocates of such conventional weapons are really damaging the cause of peace?<lb/>
In conclusion, will the noble Viscount agree that it really is no use talking about limiting nuclear weapons and letting conventional weapons increase to a great extent? At all costs we must prevent another war happening because if we do not, we shall all be for it. Will the noble Viscount agree that if we say to the
<col>344</col>
Americans, as some would have us say, "Get out, close your bases; we are going to phase out our nuclear deterrent", the only possible result would be the fall, the crash of NATO and with it the end of democracy in Britain and all the countries of Western Europe? Our only hope is to get an agreed defence policy within NATO, and for that I am sure that the noble Viscount shares my gratitude that the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, is at NATO and is more likely to achieve that objective&#x2014;which is really the objective of life or death&#x2014;than is anyone else we have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01648"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord and I am sure that he voices sentiments which Members in all parts of the House would accept, though they may have very differing views as to how the objectives should be achieved. I believe we all agree that overall security is what matters if we are to preserve the peace, and a strong alliance involving the Americans as well as ourselves is of crucial importance to us. I am very grateful that in this connection the noble Lord referred to my noble friend Lord Carrington, with whom I have had a very long and close political career, whose appointment I think many people in this country of all political parties will have greatly welcomed. I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, very much for an experienced supplementary question on what is a very auspicious day for him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01649"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may we also add our congratulations to the noble Lord on this anniversary. The noble Lord has made a significant contribution to our public affairs over a very long period. He has always been a stimulating and effective debater in both Chambers, and we hope that he will continue to attend this House for many years in order to enliven our proceedings.<lb/>
Can the noble Viscount indicate what is the Government's response to two recent statements: first, that Trident expenditure is crowding out expenditure on conventional forces and could lead to a cut in the British Army of the Rhine; and, secondly, that in the view of a Senate motion in the United States, 90,000 United States troops should be removed from Europe unless Europe is willing to pull its weight more effectively? As I understand it, that is what the Senate decided. Can the noble Viscount reaffirm the Government's commitment to an adequate conventional force, as this is surely our principal means of raising the nuclear threshold? That seems to me to be a very important point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01650"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. From now on I am sure that the House will agree that I should confine myself to answering the specific questions put to me. Regarding the noble Lord's two points, first, so far as Trident expenditure crowding out conventional forces is concerned, I think I should simply say that the Government remain totally committed to our conventional forces as part of the NATO Alliance. I think it would be very damaging indeed if, through any action of this Government or of any European Government, any credence was given to that particular point of view in America. It would be very damaging, I believe, both to Europe and to America, and to the whole free world in the long run.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01651"><member>Lord Mayhew</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I be allowed to associate my noble friend and myself with the tribute paid to the noble Lord, Lord Boothby? Some of us recall the many expressions of opinion by the noble Lord in another place, often controversial but always eloquently expressed, and, in a surprisingly large proportion of cases, fully justified by subsequent events.<lb/>
May I ask the noble Viscount whether he would agree that one of the surest ways of weakening and dividing NATO would be for Britain unilaterally to renounce all nuclear weapons? Would he also agree that the record has shown that in the last four years the opinions of the European Governments in NATO on subjects of arms control, disarmament and East-West relations have shown better judgment than those of the United States Administration? Will he therefore confirm that one of the purposes of reviving the Western European Union is to ensure that the European input into NATO's decisions on these subjects is a good deal stronger than it has been in the past?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01652"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. On his first point, he will appreciate that I profoundly agree with him, and, of course, the Government's policy makes that abundantly clear. There can be no question so far as this Government are concerned of any unilateral renunciation of nuclear weapons, or of other weapons, at all. So far as his point about the Western European Union is concerned, of course it is important that there should be a European voice together with that of our American allies, and the stronger that voice and the stronger we express it in the alliance, I believe, the better for the alliance as a whole.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01653"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I join in the congratulations which have been so felicitously expressed to the noble Lord, Lord Boothby, on his diamond jubilee? May I also express the hope that in due course he will join my noble friend Lord Shinwell in a centenary? However, may I respectfully disagree with the noble Lord's supplementary remarks? May I ask the noble Viscount whether he is aware that while NATO depends so much on nuclear weapons it is more likely to bring about our extinction than our survival?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01654"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord will know very well that I do not agree with him, and therefore the answer to his question must be, no.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01655"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while totally agreeing with the opinions of my noble friend and with the congratulations that he has received, and also with the remarks of the noble Viscount the Leader of this House, may I ask the noble Viscount whether he would accept the philosophical point that really no Government should ever state that they are satisfied with anything? Is he aware that when a Government start to say that they are satisfied with anything it is often a rather late stage leading towards the fall of that Government, which would be extremely unwelcome to me, at any rate? Will he please persuade his friends never to be satisfied with anything?&#x2014;because then I think we may advance further.</membercontribution></p>
<col>346</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01656"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am delighted to hear the contribution and the affirmation by the noble Viscount of his continued support for this Government. So far as being satisfied is concerned, I do not think that anyone who has been a Minister for, it seems, as long as I have now could ever be satisfied with anything that is happening at any time, but I try to be as satisfied as I can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01657"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, although it sounds strange coming from this side of the House, may I ask the noble Minister whether he thinks that NATO is likely to become a more effective body now that the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, is in charge of it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01658"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, those of us who know the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, I believe would profoundly think, yes, and we certainly wish him well in that endeavour.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01659"><member>Lord Boothby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask the noble Viscount, in conclusion, whether he realises that I tabled this Question in order to find out whether Her Majesty's Government had learned the lesson of the 1930s, when some of us&#x2014;not very many&#x2014;told Parliament what was happening in Germany and what could, and must, be done to stop it? Neither the Government nor the Opposition paid any heed to our warnings, and the result was the second world war. Now, just half a century later, I wanted to know whether the Government are heeding similar warnings in a very similar situation, and I am satisfied that they are.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01660"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. I believe that both this Government and the American Government, and Governments throughout Europe, by their work in NATO, have recognised that deficiency from the past. Even I, though much younger than the noble Lord, having fought throughout the last war, am in a position to realise the failures which perhaps caused that particular conflict.</membercontribution></p>

<title>British Airways: Reduction of Loans</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01661">2.49 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01662"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01663">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01664">To ask Her Majesty's Government what proposals have been put to them by British Airways for the reduction of outstanding loans, and what has been the reply.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01665"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on 12th December last year my noble friend Lord Lucas announced the Government's aim that British Airways should as far as possible improve its balance sheet through its own efforts. Since then, the airline has endeavoured to meet the Government's objective with considerable success; it has made no recent proposals to the Government for the reduction of outstanding loans.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0182"/>
<col>347</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01666"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, am I to gather from that that the Government are not now considering the request which was made for money to write off the loan outstanding in the United States? May I ask the noble Lord this question? Last week his noble friend Lord Trefgarne said that the policy statement announced last month puts British Airways on the same footing as any other private sector airline. Is there any other airline in the private sector which has asked for Government money to write off its debts?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01667"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I know of no other airline in the private sector in this country which has asked for money to write off its debts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01668"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister tell the House what is the Government's total investment in British Airways? Will he give a firm guarantee that the taxpayer will receive all that back on flotation? Is he telling the House that there is no possibility whatever of any write-off of any of the debts owed by British Airways before flotation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01669"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: The only money that the Government have given to British Airways in the last 10 years has been &#x00A3;340 million of public dividend capital. This has been an investment, not a subsidy, and British Airways has paid the Government &#x00A3;70 million of dividends over the years. In 1980 Parliament sanctioned the write-off of &#x00A3;160 million, being the inrecoverable costs of Concorde, but the remaining &#x00A3;180 million now forms the equity capital of British Airways which the Government still own and which they plan to sell at a profit on flotation next year.<lb/>
Regarding the possible capital restructure, as I said it has not been decided, if any capital reconstruction is necessary, how it would be achieved, nor how it might be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01670"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for the way in which he is endeavouring to answer these questions. But in answer to the last supplementary he said that it has "not yet been decided". Does that mean that there is still a possibility that money will be given to British Airways in order to facilitate its sale?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01671"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, British Airways' half yearly accounts are due to be published towards the end of November. After that time it will be decided whether it is necessary to take action regarding the restructuring of British Airways' debts. I cannot at present say whether or not this will be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01672"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the answer which the noble Lord has seen fit to give is rather ambiguous, is it not? Is he aware that any reconstruction of British Airways which involves the write off in any way of money contributed by the taxpayer to that company will be regarded as just another effort to dress up the privatisation of British Airways at the taxpayer's expense for the benefit of the Government's <i>rentier</i> friends?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01673"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, should it be necessary to have any reconstruction of British Airways' debt, that reconstruction would obviously be
<col>348</col>
reflected in the price achieved in the market by the privatisation of the company. Therefore it would come back to the Government in one form or another.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01674"><member>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend agree that these cracks about <i>rentier</i> friends are old-fashioned, turgid, very ancient and not even funny, even though the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, does not have a very high standard of jokes? May I ask my noble friend whether he does not agree that, following the rather confusing questions he has been asked, there is some danger that the main point of his reply may be overlooked; namely, that it is the Government's intention to sell British Airways at a profit and that the &#x00A3;178 million of capital is equity capital which will be sold then?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01675"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his question. He has put the matter very much better than I possibly could.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01676"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say to the Minister, with all the greatest respect, that it is possible for any objectively minded person to be rather unclear about what the Government are saying, having regard for the fact that two of his answers did not seem to line up completely one with the other? May I, therefore, ask him whether, if on reconsidering the matter and reading the <i>Official Report</i>, he finds it necessary to add a word or two, he will not hesitate to do so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01677"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: I will indeed, my Lords.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01678"><member>Viscount St. Davids</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord not agree that there is a unique and simple reason why British Airways should be able to ask that its debt should be treated in a different manner, and that is that uniquely, and contrary to all the other airways, it has suffered nationalisation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01679"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a point on which I do not think I wish to comment at the moment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01680"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether in answer to his noble friend Lord Peyton the noble Lord will make it clear that there is no question of selling off any public assets at a profit? Is it not in this case, as with British Telecom, a matter of disposing of public assets by way of gift coupons?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01681"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would not agree with the noble Lord that we are giving away British Airways.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Housing for Disabled People: Right to Buy</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01682">2.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01683"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01684">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01685">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will review the regulations included in the Housing and Building Control Act 1984 which in effect removes the right to buy from those disabled people whose homes have been extensively adapted to meet their special needs.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0183"/>
<col>349</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01686"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is only two months since the Act came into force, and the rules affecting housing for the disabled were extensively debated during the Bill's passage. The Government will, of course, monitor the Act's operation, but I believe it is too soon to promise a review of the new provision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01687"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister for that reply. Is the effect of the ill-judged amendment that those like Mrs. Strudwick of Colchester, whose council house has been adapted to accommodate an iron lung, may be thwarted in their attempts to own their own homes? Why do the most severely handicapped have to be discriminated against in this way?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01688"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware of the case of Mrs Strudwick, to which my noble friend refers, but I should point out that, for the first time, the Act gives the automatic right to buy to those disabled people who have had minor adaptations made to their homes, so in general the disabled are better off than they were before. However, I accept that this does not go as far as my noble friend would like. This is highlighted by the unfortunate case of Mrs. Strudwick.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01689"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the Minister agree that nothing was removed from the disabled, and that in fact the right to buy in relation to houses adapted for the disabled was brought in by the 1984 Act, it was not in the 1980 Act at all? Further, will he agree that the vast majority of houses adapted for the disabled have now come under the right to buy provisions, and that it is only a small minority of those houses which have been extensively and therefore expensively adapted that are exempt from the right to buy? I think that is a provision that he would agree many of us in this House were even then unhappy about.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01690"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite correct: the Act does not remove the right to buy from disabled people whose homes have been extensively adapted, because that right did not exist at the beginning. I am afraid that I cannot help the House about the number of dwellings involved, as I do not have the figures in front of me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01691"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may add to the noble Baroness's comment, in so far as the limitation inserted by the amendment was 7.8 metres. That is a limitation that does not allow people with special equipment, such as an iron lung, to have the right to buy which they would otherwise have had before the amendment was passed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01692"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if I may, I shall correct my noble friend slightly in that the figure is 7.5 square metres; but as to the substantive point she is making, yes, that is quite correct. But the Government and I see no reason why, once the iron lung has been taken out of the premises, the house should not revert to normal housing stock. However, as I said at the beginning, we had a substantial and extensive debate on this, and I do not think that this is the occasion to pursue the matter any further.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Population Control: Mexico Conference</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01693">3.5 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01694"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01695">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01696">To ask Her Majesty's Government what conclusions they have drawn from the Population Conference held in Mexico in August, and what additional resources they propose to make available to help restrain the growth of population, especially in the developing countries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01697"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Glenarthur)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government welcome the renewed and strengthened commitment to take action in the field of population as expressed in the detailed recommendations of the conference, and in the Declaration of Mexico City adopted by the conference on its final day. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Library. As I announced to the conference, the United Kingdom plans, subject to parliamentary approval, to increase its overall contribution to multilateral organisations working in the population field by &#x00A3;1.45 million next year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01698"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister realise what a splendid speech it was that he delivered to the conference? I suspect that he does. Does he appreciate that not the least welcome feature of his speech was the announcement that he has repeated today of further funds for population programmes including those for international agencies engaged in this work? Can the Minister (either now or if I put down a Question for Written Answer) say in more detail what plans the Government now have for implementing the revised world population plan of action which the conference endorsed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01699"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his kind remarks but I do not think that I can give him all the details that he wants in a short answer now from the dispatch Box. Regarding the extra money, the level of our contributions to the multilateral organisations concerned will be decided in the light of our assessment of the individual programmes. The most general need is to give help to developing country governments in understanding population issues, in dealing with their problems and in assisting individual couples to choose voluntarily the number and spacing of their children.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01700"><member>Baroness Robson of Kiddington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while being grateful to the noble Lord for announcing the increase in the Government's contribution towards the solving of population problems in the world, would the noble Lord agree that in the long run the best aid that we can give to the developing world is in helping them to control their population? India had a population of 350 million when they achieved independence. The population is now 720 million and is increasing by 22 million per annum. India could have produced an industrial miracle had there been population control. What I would ask the Government to do is to use an even greater percentage of their
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0184"/>
<col>351</col>
overseas aid to help establish education in schools and education in the villages to help control population. And this does not apply only to India, it applies to Kenya and to large parts of Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01701"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the first part of the noble Baroness's supplementary question. If one looks at population trends throughout the world, the population will have risen to 6,127 million by the end of the year 2000. That is almost double what it was in 1974. Regarding increasing aid, this is more a matter for my honourable friend the Minister for Overseas Development and I am sure that he will note what the noble Baroness has said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01702"><member>Lord Hatch of Lusby</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I ask this question? While one may welcome the announcement that he has made as to added assistance from the British Government to the international population programme, would he agree that in the long run the only way of limiting population growth is to raise living standards, and in particular to reduce infant mortality? Is it not the case that in many developing countries where half of the infants die before they have reached the age of five, it is simply impossible to put over the education for family planning and reduction until these figures are reduced&#x2014;which is a part of the increase in the purchasing power and living standards of the people of developing countries?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01703"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we do not share the view that economic development alone will automatically bring about a slowing of the rate of population growth in the developing world. We believe that population programmes make an active contribution to social as well as economic development and must be urgently pursued for those as well as humanitarian reasons. That is the short answer to the noble Lord's supplementary question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01704"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not the Minister agree that there is something slightly repulsive in advocating to some people that they should reduce their families? It is a very personal matter. What right have they to tell other people how exactly they are going to have their families&#x2014;whether large or small?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01705"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with much of what the noble Baroness has said. However, I hope that she will note that in the light of the enormous increase in numbers that we expect between now and the year 2000, some help, advice and education should be given, where it is possible to do so, to those in the countries most directly concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01706"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, has my noble friend observed the success in Singapore of restraint in population growth by the adroit use by Lee Kuan Yew of the tax system?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01707"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a most interesting idea. How far it can be pursued elsewhere I am not quite sure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01708"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord agree that progressive organisations such as, for example,
<col>352</col>
Population Services, with which I am connected, only set up clinics and give help where they have been invited to do so by the countries into which they go? There is no case of forcing it upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01709"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a very good point and it is certainly the case that there is no coercion in this matter at all. It is very much a question of the countries themselves deciding how best they can be helped.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Environmental Pollution:<lb/> Air Pollution&#x2014;Reports</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01726">3.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01727"><member>Lord Ashby</member> rose to call attention to the Tenth Report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, <i>Tackling pollution<i>&#x2014;</i>experience and prospects</i> (Cmnd. 9149); and to move for papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01728">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I should like to begin by thanking the noble Lord on the Government Bench who has allotted time for this debate and I am delighted that the report from your Lordships' Select Committee is to be considered also in this same debate.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01729">This is indeed an opportune moment; it is just over ten years since the Control of Pollution Act 1974 received the Royal Assent. It was introduced into your Lordships' House as the Protection of the Environment Bill in November 1973 by the noble Lord, Lord Windlesham. In the course of his speech on 27th November he said that it was an important element in the Government's legislative programme. It was welcomed on all sides of the House, and it was taken so seriously that eight days were spent on the Committee stage.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01730">The Bill then lapsed on the change of Government. It was promptly re-introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Shepherd, under a fresh title, but it was the same child. The noble Lord pleaded for discussion to be brief so that the Bill could be sent as soon as possible to another place. This, too, was agreed willingly on all sides of the House. On Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Garnsworthy, spoke for the Government. He ended his speech on 21st May 1974 by saying (at col. 1405) that with goodwill and co-operation it would become an Act
<quote>"that will be regarded as a charter of the first importance in the history of this country".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01731">The Bill received an equally warm welcome in another place, and on 17th June 1974 (at col. 114) the right honourable Lady who is now Prime Minister said from the Opposition Benches that the Bill
<quote>"is likely to have a greater and more lasting effect on the quality of life in many parts of Britain than most other measures. We shall do all we can to assist its passage to the statute book".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01732">No Act could have had a more auspicious start. Has it fulfilled its promise? That is what your Lordships are asked to discuss this afternoon, as we note the Tenth Report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. It is a masterly document: readable, realistic and in places courteously but astringently critical. I have time only to select two or three items for discussion, because many of your Lordships will be able to elaborate in far more detail on what I am going to sketch out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01733">The first theme is that circumstances have greatly changed since 1974. Some people feared then that economic growth might outstrip resources: the fears now are that economic growth may not revive sufficiently to give us the standard of living to which we are accustomed. In the present economic climate some people assume that expenditure on pollution control can be regarded as a kind of optional extra that we cannot afford for the present. The Tenth Report shows this assumption to be totally false. It emphasises that public opinion still takes the environment very
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0186"/>
<col>355</col>
seriously. Indeed, politicians do well to remember that more people belong to environmental or conservation movements than belong to any political party in Britain. Zeal and pressure from these movements sometimes usurp the best judgment, and the Royal Commission issues a warning against that risk; for nearly all pollution, after all, is a secondary consequence of acts which benefit society. It is not a case of a good against a bad: it is a case of one good against another good, and it is not easy for governments to reconcile these conflicts by legislation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01734">The report describes how public agitation, amplified by the media, has influenced action (and in some cases inaction) over environmental policy in the last ten years. So has another new factor, and that is the environmental policy of the European Community. The Royal Commission believes that Britain has a reputation of obstructiveness over compliance with environmental directives from Brussels. It is true that the Government, and the Select Committee in your Lordships' House, have been critical of many of these directives&#x2014;and rightly so. Some of them were shoddy in their scientific foundations and unreasonable in their rigidity. But I believe that these running controversies between Britain and the Community have led to much good, and each side has learned something from the other.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01735">Criticism from Brussels has forced the water authorities to define exactly what they mean by "environmental quality objectives". It has also obliged Britain to adopt air quality standards for smoke, sulphur and lead. Criticism from Westminster, largely from your Lordships' Select Committee, has improved the quality of directives no end. This is evident from one of the recent directives on cadmium. Apparently that has even persuaded the Community that there is merit in what is really the linchpin of British environmental policy; namely, to use the best practical means to control pollution and&#x2014;this is what is important&#x2014;that this phrase includes economic and social as well as purely technical considerations. But the report does more. It warns that unless Britain is co-operative over the Community's environmental programme our undoubtedly good influence over the programme will be weakened.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01736">At the head of one of the chapters in the Royal Commission's report is a quotation from Adlai Stevenson. It reads as follows:
<quote>"Government &#x2026; cannot be wiser than the people".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01737">My overall impression from reading the Tenth Report is that over the last ten years governments on both sides of the House have been less wise than the people. The pace for responding to the Royal Commission's recommendations and advice and the pace for the implementation of the Control of Environment Act have often been forced on governments either by public agitation or by the threat of censure from other member states of the Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01738">The report presents a very fair balance sheet of achievements and failures. Air over Britain has become dramatically cleaner since the 1960s; there are fewer grossly polluted rivers; and there is better control over toxic wastes. Above all, in this report the commissioners vindicate the principles behind British environmental policy, such as our determination to
<col>356</col>
take into account the capacity of the environment to disperse and degrade pollutants and so render them harmless; our emphasis on environmental quality objectives, rather than on rigid emission standards, when this is practicable; our preference, compared with that of our cousins in the United States, for negotiation over court conflicts; and our preference on the whole for voluntary agreements over compulsion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01739">But, that said, there is still no ground for complacency. Too many decisions by government have been acts of expediency. Indeed, there is ground for serious concern unless the Government commit themselves to a more vigorous effort and, even more important, to a coherent strategy. Let me give three examples to illustrate what I have just said. It is 12 years since the Royal Commission, in its Second Report, pressed strongly for a lifting of what someone at the time called "the Miasma of Confidentiality" that covers information about discharges into water and air and things dumped on land. The same theme&#x2014;the warning that unnecessary secrecy feeds suspicion and weakens public confidence&#x2014;was reiterated in the Commission's Fifth, Seventh and Ninth Reports. In this Tenth Report 18 pages are devoted to the issue. This means that over 40 royal commissioners over the last 14 years have asked the Government to do something about this. When is it going to be done?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01740">There has, of course, been some improvement. There has been improvement in public access to information, but when you come to look at it you see that it has nearly all been informal and voluntary on the part of the organisations that have offered it. The obligation to have registers open to the public under the Control of Pollution Act will not become operative until 1985 and there is even, as yet, no guidance about the information to be put into these registers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01741">As to the officers of the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate, they do what they can, but since their regrettable transfer to the Health and Safety Executive they are prohibited, as they never were in their long history as the Alkali Inspectorate since 1863, from disclosing information. The Commission's criticism of this is blunt. It recommends that the Health and Safety at Work Act etc. 1974 should be amended,
<quote>"to remove the obsolete and unnecessary bar on disclosure of information."</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01742">Better still would be to return the inspectorate to the place where it really belongs&#x2014;the Department of the Environment. I know that this is the view of the Confederation of British Industry and I suspect it is the view of most of the inspectors themselves.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01743">This 10-year delay in implementing parts of the Control of Pollution Act, after the Act had had such an auspicious start, is an example of a flaw in the machinery of Government that the Commission deplores. I can do no better than quote paragraph 3.50 of the Commission's Report:
<quote>"The piecemeal and still incomplete implementation of the Control of Pollution 1974 is only one example of 'optional legislation', where ministers' unfettered discretion over commencement dates can effectively frustrate Parliament's intentions &#x2026; the handling of this Act reflects little credit on successive administrations".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01744">Parliament's intentions, so evident, so enthusiastic 10 years ago, have in part&#x2014;not in whole&#x2014;been frustrated.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0187"/>
<col>357</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01745">Another cause for concern is the lack of formal coordination between the agencies responsible for managing pollution control. It does no good to abate pollution in one place only to increase it in another. Thus sulphur dioxide emissions&#x2014;to mention something so topical&#x2014;from power stations can be reduced by scrubbing with limestone, but for every tonne of sulphur removed four tonnes of sulphated limestone must be dumped somewhere else.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01746">The Royal Commission in its Fifth Report, under my noble friend Lord Rowers, recommended that pollution problems should be managed in a much more coherent way by expanding the principle of best practicable means to cover the best practicable environmental option. In their belated response to the Fifth Report&#x2014;only six years after it was published!&#x2014;the Government gave their blessing to this idea. So far, so good. But they reject the means for carrying out the idea proposed by the Commission and have proposed nothing to put in its place. The Commission's proposal was to have a Her Majesty's Pollution Inspectorate which would bring into one service the officials responsible for pollution control in air, water and on land. The Tenth Report of the Commission records its disappointment that the various inspectorates are still, as the Commissioners say, "fragmentary and insufficiently co-ordinated".</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01747">This brings me to the main cause of concern in the Commission's Tenth Report. It is that Governments, responding to piecemeal pressures as they are publicised, are deflected from having and sticking to a long-term strategy for Britain's environment. This has already been an embarrassment for industry. For example, procrastination over the implementation of Part II of the Control of Pollution Act has created difficulties for the petroleum industry in deciding about equipment for coastal refineries. The Commission therefore recommends that the principle of best practicable environmental option should be fortified with the principle of best environmental timetable for the allocation of resources for pollution control. I am sure noble Lords opposite will agree that it is not without precedent to expect this present Government to have a policy based on principles and to stick to it and to have no U-turns. All the Commission asks is that this practice now be extended to environmental policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01748">The Government could demonstrate that they are in earnest about this by appointing a junior Minister in the Department of the Environment, with responsibility solely for the protection of the environment. In saying that, I want it to be clear that in no way is this a criticism of the present junior Minister who looks after environmental affairs. He earns golden opinions from everyone who has to deal with him. The point I am making is that he has other responsibilities and the fate of the environment is so important that it would be well if Her Majesty's Government would consider allowing him to shed the other ones he has, or appointing someone who can be responsible solely for environmental protection.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01749">In addition to a phased programme for the deployment of resources for pollution abatement, there is need for a much more serious attitude to what the Commission calls "environmental time bombs"
<col>358</col>
that may lie beneath some of our industrial developments, even in such unexpected places as the electronics industry or in bio-engineering. Your Lordships are already aware of the media publicity given to some of these themes: the long-term effects of low-level radiation; the possible long-term effects of intensive agriculture, not made any less dangerous because there is a section in the Control of Pollution Act&#x2014;which I believe is reproduced in the code issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&#x2014;which virtually exempts farmers from getting into difficulties about pollution if they are pursuing what is described as "good agricultural practice", which I imagine any lawyer could use to his advantage in defending a farmer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01750">There are the dangers of the long-term effects of gases causing a change in the cloak of ozone in the upper atmosphere; and then there is the most ominous teaser in the pack, which is the possible effects on climate of something we know for certain is going on, and that is the accumulation of carbon dioxide from the burning of coal and oil. Only last week, in the scientific journal <i>Nature</i>, four books were reviewed by an authority on that subject. Every one of the writers of those four books takes a serious view of the long-term dangers that may&#x2014;scientists will never go beyond using the word "may" in public&#x2014;come from the accumulation of carbon dioxide. The commission warns, I think very rightly, that the social and economic consequences of climatic change which might be caused by this in the next century "could be very great indeed". Not much perhaps can be done; but something could be done now. The Government's disregard for this long-range problem is perhaps illustrated by the way the Commission on Energy and Environment has been put into abeyance at a time when it ought to be challenged with this very important possible future time bomb.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01751">Finally, the commission do not overlook the obvious comment which must be in the minds of some of your Lordships while I am speaking; namely, that protection of the environment is good and that we all want it and like it but how are we going to pay for it, compared with other priorities like education, health and defence? Among these, what kind of priority can the environment expect? It is a mistake and shortsighted, say the commission, to think that a lowering of environmental standards will help to preserve employment or encourage enterprise. For one thing, high standards at home may help to sustain an internationally competitive pollution abatement industry. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Environment made just this point last year. He said:
<quote>If British industry in one aspect were to make Britain a laggard rather than a leader in environmental standards &#x2026; British industry will in another aspect inevitably lose out".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01752">Finally, as to expenditure on finding out how to defuse possible long-term environmental time bombs, may I suggest an analogy to your Lordships? We have no way to calculate the chance that we shall have to use the weapons financed by the defence budget. We are not confident that another war is coming, but we take the view that it is prudent to act as though a war might come. We are similarly uncertain about the environmental time bombs that may come from the emissions of man-made wastes. It is prudent to assume
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0188"/>
<col>359</col>
that there is some risk from these; and if that is accepted, it is prudent, as for defence, to invest money and resources in finding ways to defuse them. I beg to move for papers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01753">Moved, To call attention to the Tenth Report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, <i>Tackling pollution</i>&#x2014;<i>experience and prospects</i> (Cmnd. 9149); and to move for papers.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Ashby</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01754">3.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01755"><member>Lord Nathan</member> had given notice of his intention to move, That this House takes note of the Report of the European Communities Committee on Air Pollution (22nd Report, 1983&#x2013;84, H.L. 265).</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01756">The noble Lord said: My Lords, may I, as a member of the Royal Commission, express my appreciation, which I know will be shared by all other members of the commission, including its distinguished chairman, Sir Richard Southwood, for the very kind comments which the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, has made about the Tenth Report? The present chairman is the fourth successor of the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, who was the first chairman and who set the pattern and the standards. It is good to know that the high standards which he set have, in his view, been maintained. I am very glad that the arrangements are that the Tenth Report of the Royal Commission shall be debated at the same time as the recent report of the European Communities Committee on Air Pollution, for they are intimately related.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01757">Years ago, our prime concern over air pollution and other pollution was with growth visible pollution, but since then another factor has supervened. Now there is increasing concern&#x2014;and rightly so&#x2014;among the public about unseen, unsensed pollution. It may arise from radiation, the problem known as acid rain, heavy metals, hazardous waste or other causes. It is this which is causing increasing public concern, and I suggest that it is one of the factors which has resulted in the lowering of the threshold of risk which is now acceptable to the public. These factors are compounded, increased, when there is scientific uncertainty as to whether or not the unseen and unsensed pollution will have irreversible effects and be cumulative and whether the damage may take a long time to become apparent. These are causes of great worry to the public. We refer to this in the Tenth Report and also to the question: when should the Government act in circumstances where there is scientific uncertainty?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01758">May I refer to paragraph 6.30 in the report of the Royal Commission where we condense much of what appears elsewhere in the report on the subject. We talk about the politician or manager who must decide what action to take now and to the fact that he cannot wait for the rigorous proof required by the scientist. We refer to the Government, who are responsible for the public well-being and also for the protection of the environment, and say that there may be a difference between what can be believed with confidence and what it is prudent to assume. This is a problem with which we were directly confronted in the Report of the European Communities Committee on Air Pollution, one of the subjects of the debate this afternoon.</p>
<col>360</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01759">I should like to refer to paragraph 102 of the ECC report on air pollution because it condenses, I believe, the problem and the solution which we arrived at when dealing with what is known as the acid rain problem.
<quote>"The Committee consider that it would be foolish and dangerous for no action to be taken to combat the problems of air pollution. The magnitude of the damage resulting, the length of time over which this might become apparent, and its widespread effects if the fears expressed prove to be justified, make it necessary to implement a preventive programme now, despite the scientific uncertainties. The problems and costs of such action, including the availability of suitable technology, must be measured against the danger perceived and the resultant damage".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01760">We believe that the action we propose, as I shall mention in a moment, matches these criteria. I hope that in his reply the noble Lord the Minister will indicate what action the Government propose to take in these contexts and whether he disagrees or agrees with the steps we have proposed. I hope that he will not maintain the stance which has for so long been taken by Government: that we should wait until all uncertainty is dispelled.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01761">The report on air pollution relates to no fewer than five documents issued by the Commission and I shall comment briefly on each. Other speakers will no doubt take up other points on these five documents. This debate, however, gives us an opportunity to express our thanks to the staff and to our specialist adviser for the assistance they have given in the preparation of the report and also to the witnesses for their help in providing evidence. In what follows I shall refer to the various documents by the abbreviated titles which we adopted in the report itself.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01762">I shall start with the large combustion plant directive. This specifies an admission limit for plants with rated thermal output of 50 megawatts or more. It includes proposals for reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates; and these reductions shall be achieved by 1995 in each member state overall&#x2014;that is, not plant-by-plant, but by each member state as a unit&#x2014;by reference to 1980 data.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01763">The reductions proposed are 60 per cent. in the case of sulphur dioxide and 40 per cent. each in the case of oxides of nitrogen and particulates. The proposals are expressed to be directly related to acid deposition.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01764">So far as particulates are concerned, the committee have noted that control of the issue of particulates is well practised in the United Kingdom but they agree that it is right to reduce emissions to the lowest practical level. We had in mind that the standards adopted and practised in this country&#x2014;particularly in relation to large power stations&#x2014;are very high, and the cost of a substantial reduction will itself be high.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01765">So far as oxides of nitrogen are concerned, we are advised that there is no known system of post-combustion control of oxides of nitrogen adapted to use in power stations, and that there is no prospect that such a system may shortly be evolved. It is against that background that we considered the proposals. These proposals are criticised by the committee on two main grounds. The first is that adoption of the 1980 reference base data throughout the community is misconceived because different measuring and monitoring systems were adopted in certain member countries in 1980&#x2014;and in some, there was none at all.
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0189"/>
<col>361</col>
Secondly, no account is taken of steps to reduce emissions in any member state prior to that date. The proposals are, therefore, at least inequitable&#x2014;and we believe unworkable. Of course, the percentages and dates specified are taken quite arbitrarily.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01766">In the United Kingdom the only means of achieving the stated target reductions on emissions of sulphur dioxide by 1995 would be to equip the 12 largest coal-fired electricity power stations with flue gas desulphurisation, which I shall refer to as FGD, if I may. There are many disadvantages in FGD. First, there is a transfer of the disposal of sulphur dioxide from air to land which involves the use of some 4 million tonnes of limestone per annum and the disposal of some 7&#x00B7;5 million tonnes of calcium sulphate waste to land. Secondly, there is the factor of cost. To fit the 12 largest electricity power stations&#x2014;that is, those which are coal fired&#x2014;with FGD would, we are told, involve capital outlay of &#x00A3;1,430 million. On top of this, there would be additional expenditure of &#x00A3;560 million in the construction of new plant required to compensate for loss of efficiency directly due to the fitting of FGD. This further new plant would of course bum more coal and emit more oxide of nitrogen, and it would produce more sulphur dioxide&#x2014;which would have to be treated by further FGD equipment.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01767">There is a further consequence of this, as we see it. If such substantial capital expenditure is to be incurred, it is in all probability likely to result in demands, which will be agreed to, that there shall be long periods of amortisation of this cost. Thus, outworn equipment will be continued in action for this very reason, for a period long after it would otherwise have been taken out of commission. The running cost attached to the equipment of 12 power stations with FGD, we are informed, would be of the order of &#x00A3;350 million per annum. This, of course, is quite separate from the money to which I referred earlier.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01768">Finally, there is the point that flue gas desulphurisation has no impact whatever on emissions of oxides of nitrogen. The committee accept that plant recently commissioned, which has expected useful life far into the next century, should be equipped with FGD for lack of any satisfactory alternative; and they propose that no fewer than two such power stations be so equipped.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01769">The committee received evidence on the development of pressurised fluid bed combustors, which are a type of furnace presently under development at Grimethorpe by the CEGB and the National Coal Board with financial assistance provided by the EEC. We understand that that financial assistance is shortly to be withdrawn. We believe that this system should be fully developed for installation by 1999; that is the evidence we have received. Other evidence indicates that with enthusiasm and vigour that date could be advanced by a number of years. We regard the development of pressurised fluid bed combustors as a matter of urgent priority and propose that an approach be made to the EEC to continue its financial support.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01770">The advantages of the pressurised fluid bed combustors can be briefly stated. First, it offers a 13 per cent. cost advantage over new conventional plant
<col>362</col>
fitted with FGD. It is more efficient and therefore reduces the running cost and the consumption of coal for the units of electricity produced. It has enhanced environmental acceptability compared with conventional plant because the sulphur dioxide is captured in the course of combustion and the quantity of oxides of nitrogen should be substantially reduced. The notion that the sulphur dioxide is, under this system, captured in combustion reminds me of the Act of 1825, which came into force in Derby in that year under which it was prescribed that steam engines shall consume their own smoke; it is the same philosophy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01771">The preventative approach which we recommend seems to us to have many advantages over equipping all, as a crash programme, with FGD. It is surely far better to incur such additional costs as may be incurred by re-equipping plant early than equipping old plant with FGD and maintaining that old plant in existence beyond its normal useful life, which may well be, as we are told, around the end of this century.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01772">Turning now to the framework directive, the proposal as originally presented caused us concern, as it did to witnesses, but it was amended, and it was agreed by the Council of Ministers on 1st March 1984 subject, in the case of the United Kingdom, to parliamentary reserve.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01773">The proposals provide, among other things, for "prior authorisation" of new, listed plants and the gradual adaptation of existing plants. These provisions conform closely to the controls exercised by the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, and the proposals effectively adopt the longstanding United Kingdom principle of "best practicable means." However, the plants listed in the schedule to this directive extend beyond the present responsibilities of the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate, and therefore fall under the local authorities, whose effective department is the Department of Environmental Health, the chief officers of which are, of course, members of the Institution of Environmental Health Officers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01774">We recommended in the Tenth Report of the Royal Commission that the powers of environmental health officers should be extended to come into line with those exercisable by the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate, both in respect of prior approval and in the application of best practicable means. We endorse that proposal in this present report on air pollution. It has to be remembered that at the moment, apart from one or two minor exceptions, an environmental health officer has no power except to act where there has been a public nuisance and that, therefore, he has no power to prevent these nuisances arising.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01775">The Government announced in 1982, in response to the Royal Commission's Fifth Report&#x2014;we are now dealing with its Tenth Report&#x2014;a review of air pollution control legislation. The proposal which is now before us indicates that the Government should be asked to hasten publication of the proposals, and it is to be hoped that they will incorporate the modification of the powers of environmental health officers to which I have referred.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01776">There is a nitrogen dioxide directive, about which I can be quite brief. This specifies environmental air quality standards for reasons of health. The evidence
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0190"/>
<col>363</col>
which we received from the Government's chief medical officer indicates that a somewhat higher standard would be acceptable for health purposes if we accept that advice. There are also proposals for extensive monitoring to ensure that these quality standards are maintained. We are told that the capital cost of that monitoring programme would be &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million, and that the annual cost would be &#x00A3;2 million.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01777">The committee received evidence, which it accepts, that the levels of nitrogen dioxide in this country are well below the limits proposed even by the commission, except possibly in certain high spots. Therefore, the committee proposes that there should be a pilot scheme of monitoring using transportable stations. Of course, the most effective means of reducing nitrogen dioxide at ground level would be by reducing vehicle emissions, and proposals put forward by the EC are at present under consideration by Sub-Committee G of the Select Committee.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01778">The forestry regulation provides also for monitoring, but there we take a different view with regard to the monitoring proposals. The forestry regulation is concerned with establishing a scheme of monitoring acid deposition in forests, to be financed at varying degrees by the commission. The purpose of the regulation is to establish a Community scheme to provide forests in the Community with increased protection against acid rain. The evidence from the Forestry Commission to us is that no damage has been found to trees in the United Kingdom derived from acid deposition except from known point sources, but we regard this as irrelevant to a consideration of the monitoring programme in a scientific survey of this kind. We believe that it is just as important to ascertain that no damage is done in certain geographical, geological and meteorological conditions by a given quantity of acid deposition as it is to see that damage does result. We therefore support this proposal.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01779">Finally, I come to the communication. This is a statement of aims and plans for the commission. It includes proposals (or, rather, ideas) in respect of which it will be putting forward proposals concerning the adoption of the bubble concept, as it is known in the United States, and the adoption of charges to support regulations in the control of pollution. We shall look forward to receiving those proposals in due course. The communication re-emphasises that preventative action is chiefly in their minds, and the integration of environmental policy in all fields of activity, including energy and industry. In doing so, of course, it reflects the major policy statement contained in the Community's third action programme, where it resolved to adopt an anticipatory and preventative policy. Integration of environmental policy into all other fields of activity is, of course, also a recommendation and firm view of the Royal Commission which was expressed in the Tenth Report at the end of the sixth chapter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01780">The Select Committee welcome the initiative represented by these five documents issued by the commission. They seem to us to indicate a determination to create a truly European programme. As such, we hope it may form an example which others will follow.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01782"><member>Baroness Birk</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, for moving his Motion this afternoon and giving this House an opportunity to discuss this very important report. I sometimes feel that one of the reasons for sustaining the House of Lords and its survival is that probably these commission reports would never be discussed if it were not for this House. The noble Lord, Lord Nathan, also moved his report extraordinarily well. The two reports together have given us an enormous amount to chew on in one afternoon, and my noble friend Lady Nicol will be concentrating largely on air pollution.<lb/>
I should like to join with the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, in his tribute to Sir Richard Southwood and his commission. They have produced a mammoth report offering a comprehensive survey of environmental pollution. If the recommendations in previous reports going back to 1972 had been implemented even in some part, the commission would not have been faced with such a vast and widespread task. Unfortunately, the story that emerges is absolutely appalling. Although clothed in polite language it is a penetrating critique of Britain's environmental policy in recent years and tackles pollution with concise commitment and strong purpose. Governments past and present share the blame for this.<lb/>
When I was a Minister at the Department of the Environment I dealt from the Government Benches with the debate on the Royal Commission on Nuclear Energy. The Royal Commission was then chaired by Professor Flowers, who I am happy to see now in this House and who will be speaking this afternoon. Although they were not part of my departmental responsibilities, I spoke on environmental matters in this House, and I realised then that they are very much put on the back burners of Government policy. There appears to be a feeling that it is all very good stuff, but nothing is vital or urgent and other things are more important and require urgent legislation; that is the way such matters are treated. That is why we are getting a build-up of the non-results which are before us today and which have been increasing all the time.<lb/>
The report shows an incredible record of noncompliance with legislative decisions. There has been an erosion of democratic powers, and the will of Parliament has been grossly thwarted. We can see a lack of planning, continuity and foresight, which has led to what the report calls:
<quote>"cycles of complacency alternating with panic".</quote>
There is concern that that will lead to new pollution "time bombs", as the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, pointed out.<lb/>
Unfortunately, there are so many examples that could be taken from this excellent report that, like other speakers, I can pick out only a few without hogging the whole debate. For example, the Minerals Act 1981 cannot be implemented because no regulations have yet been issued. The waste disposal plans which were drawn up in 1976 gave local authorities powers but no duties.<lb/>
I have with me today a map that has recently been produced by the geography department of the London School of Economics. It shows in different colours those authorities whose waste disposal plan is in final

form or with the Secretary of State or in draft. I can count only 13 plans which have so far reached a final form. Eight are with the Secretary of State and 13 are in draft form. I have not managed to count correctly the number of areas for which no plans are available at all. It is 50, or even more. The worst areas are, unfortunately, in Wales and Scotland, where the district councils are the waste authorities. Only a tiny minority of waste disposal authorities have completed their plans since the Act set no date for their completion, and the Government have not leaned on them. The reasons for that are not only environmental, but are also concerned with the problems of local government, which I shall come to later.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Nathan, referred to air quality monitoring. That takes up a great part of his report. Whereas in 1977&#x2013;78 the amount spent on monitoring alone was &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;59 million, the figure dropped in 1982&#x2013;83 to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;3 million. That is in money, not in real terms. One would have expected an increase but certainly not a decrease.<lb/>
Another example which concerns me greatly is noise abatement. It is not covered in the report, as I think it was felt that the next report would deal with it, but I understand that that is not so. It is of tremendous importance today and I believe that there are more complaints to the Department of the Environment on noise levels than on anything else.<lb/>
We come to the problem of how all these matters can be implemented. The first problem is that it is the lowest tier of the local authorities which has discretionary (but not mandatory) powers to deal with these problems of noise abatement, air quality monitoring (at least in part) and waste disposal. The local authorities have powers but no duties; they have discretion but no money. Few have made use of their discretionary powers. Even where they have the will and scrape the barrel for meagre resources, they fear to act because they are worried about the cost of compensation, since firms all have the right of appeal.<lb/>
The situation is getting worse since local authorities are being even more squeezed. There is rate capping; the rate support grant is an inadequate financial cover. The Government's attitude to local government finance means that many of the Royal Commission's excellent recommendations are quite unrealistic today. In view of the impossibility of local authorities being able to fulfil what are meant to be their duties, there must be another avenue of finance and resource from the Government.<lb/>
The abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan counties will mean the splitting up of highly skilled expertise and experience in pollution control. In particular the Royal Commission refers to the "valuable expertise" of the GLC's scientific services, which it hopes will be retained after abolition. I read through all the statements on abolition that I could to try to find something that referred to these special scientific services, but I discovered that they are lumped together with centralised purchasing and left to the boroughs, which is not a happy situation. Added to this catalogue of disastrous decisions there is the abolition of the Clean Air Council and of the Noise Advisory Council. Both those actions are regretted by the Royal Commission.<lb/>
<col>366</col>
We then come to the question of staffing. I believe the cuts in the Department of the Environment staff and in the inspectorate section are very serious if we are to hope for improvement and not see further deterioration in this field. Since the report was published, some of the cuts have been halted and to a very small degree reversed. But certain areas are seriously understaffed&#x2014;for example, the Central Directorate on Environmental Pollution, where the staff levels are down 30 per cent. since 1980. That means that it cannot perform one of its most important roles&#x2014;the anticipatory role. There have also been cuts in the National Environment Research Council, which performs a vital service. The Factory Inspectorate staff has been cut by 13 per cent. between 1979 and 1982. This whole area should be one of growth and not of shrinkage.<lb/>
Where there has been implementation it has been forced on Britain by our EEC obligations. I think the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, said that some of the directives were "shoddy". Nevertheless, once they have been thrashed out&#x2014;as he agreed&#x2014;they are a great improvement, certainly, on doing nothing at all. Our negative attitude has resulted in a poor reputation for Britian and, as the Royal Commission points out, a failure to put Britain's,
<quote>"considerable experience at the service of the European Community".</quote>
We are always in the position of dragging our feet and being behind.<lb/>
For example, under the pressure of EEC directives, implementation of Part II of the Control of Pollution Act began in 1983, but the actual implementation procedure means that there will be no discernible improvement in water quality around our coasts and in our estuaries (with the occasional exception) until the late 1980s at the earliest&#x2014;14 years after the introduction of that Act. One does not need to be a scientist or even an environmentalist to see what has been happening around our coasts and in our estuaries.<lb/>
There is need for a positive Government statement that the extensive "deemed consents" that have been granted will be determined by water authorities by a fixed date, even if that is 1990. I hope that the Minister when he replies will be able to give an undertaking on this.<lb/>
The situation is made considerably worse by the continuation of secrecy in dealing with environmental pollution. There appears to be in this country a sort of "Nanny-knows-best" attitude. That attitude from this Government is rather surprising because the Prime Minister usually takes an entirely contrary view to that kind of approach.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ashby, in the report of the Royal Commission&#x2014;which he chaired in 1972&#x2014;and again today, twelve years later, pointed to this whole area of secrecy as one of the most crucial factors in prolonging pollution. The Fifth Report of the Royal Commission on air pollution, which was not responded to until 1982, recommended that controlling authorities should be able to release to the public, who I believe have the right to know, data on emissions. There has been no action.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0192"/>
<col>367</col>
Then we look at pesticide control. The Royal Commission's Seventh Report in 1979 recommended that information should not necessarily be withheld. Yet I believe there is some proposed pesticide control legislation, which is probably going to move towards the statute book and be announced in the Queen's Speech. It contains no proposals for dealing with an unacceptable degree of secrecy surrounding the hazard of the use of pesticides. Why is this so? Or is this not so and is there something in the legislation? Perhaps the Minister will answer that question when he replies. However, I understand the legislation was drafted even before the consultation period had finished. As I understand it, up to the time of this debate, certainly, no clauses dealing with confidentiality had been included.<lb/>
Another circumstance in which confidentiality is extremely harmful is where the factory inspectorate are required to give information to employees at a plant dealing with potentially hazardous materials or processes but are forbidden to disclose this information to members of the public. In 1983 a local resident asked for information about levels of asbestos contamination occuring during asbestos stripping in Fulham Power Station. The information was refused him. He was refused the results of the monitoring. He was refused copies of the notice served on contractors and the contractors' methods statement. He was even refused results of sampling by the factory inspectorate. Yet this man could have been at greater risk than even the contractors' employees, who have the right to know. He was put in a position which, if it was not in many ways sad and possibly tragic, would be almost ludicrous.<lb/>
I believe, as do many other people, including the commission, that industry's worries are overstated. Americans and Canadians are much more open in their exchanges over pollution control and what are very often considered here as industrial secrets. As has been pointed out, if somebody really wants to find out, he can find out by testing the substance itself without this tremendous curtain of secrecy. This curtain of secrecy is not only quite wrong from any political, civil rights and natural justice point of view: it makes the whole area of research more difficult and increases the cost because it is often difficult for researchers to obtain the known data. The onus should be on the firms and not on the public, so that the firms can argue their case if they feel they have a substantial one which they believe requires secrecy on their part. However, as the commission recommends, there should always be a presumption in favour of the public having unrestricted access to information.<lb/>
Relating to this area of secrecy, I remember that during the passage of the Water Act through this House we fought very hard to have local representatives on the water authorities. But, although there are some <i>ex officio</i> members, it still was not written into the Act, and the Secretary of State is not under any legal obligation to find places for the representatives. I remember very clearly a very long and quite fierce discussion on the question of press and public being present at the meetings. However, this was not in the Bill and its inclusion in the Act was refused by the Government.<lb/>
<col>368</col>
Secrecy is not only inexplicable to the public, who are quite rightly very suspicious of it, but it has a generally debilitating effect on all the positive work that is being done in this area. In debating this matter this afternoon, I think many of us&#x2014;indeed, practically everybody who is speaking in this debate, from whichever part of the House they come&#x2014;fear that there will be just a good debate on the subject but no action will be taken: that we will be soothed with flattering words while the action is pigeon-holed as it usually is. However, I am hoping that this afternoon the Minister will be able to give some answers about the various dates on which implementation will take place. I hope he will have something to say on the question of secrecy and also on this very important question of how local authorities are going to implement the duties that have been laid on them without their having the financial means of being able to do so.<lb/>
I must apologise to the Minister and the House for my absence if the debate goes on after 6.30 p.m. We have had a bereavement in the family and I am afraid I shall have to leave then if the debate has not finished. I will then read the Minister's answers in <i>Hansard</i>.<lb/>
Environmental pollution must be given a very much higher priority. It is an essential ingredient in the quality of life. It is difficult to understand quite why, with all the interest in local groups and membership of environmental groups, this is something that seems very easy for governments to push aside, and, as I said earlier, put on the back burners of their governmental activity. As we know, lack of funds is the usual reply. But many of these recommendations would generate employment as well as improving our national welfare. I hope that the Minister will be able to come forward with some very definite Government propositions which will put into effect the Royal Commission's final recommendation that:
<quote>"Pollution control policy and environmental policy generally should be accorded the priority and resources adequate for then-integration in the national decision-making process".</quote>
This is the kernel of a great deal of what has been said and argued in the report. I hope we shall not have to wait the many years that we had to wait with the other reports to get any response at all, let alone any action.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01784"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very happy to follow the noble Baroness after her stimulating speech. I should like to express my sympathy to her regarding the family bereavement which will take her away from us early this evening. I should like to follow those remarks by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, on moving this Motion calling attention to the Royal Commission's Tenth Report and on the admirable speech which he made in introducing it. He has the distinction of having been the first chairman of the commission. Noble Lords on all sides will agree that his contribution to this House on scientific matters has been brilliant. We all very much value his presence here.<lb/>
In the interests of economy of time my comments will be confined to water pollution because I want to make a brief observation about the Select Committee's report on air pollution after I have spoken about the Royal Commission. In the main this
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0193"/>
<col>369</col>
report concentrates on estuarial and coastal water pollution in the United Kingdom. So there is an implication, which I take as timely, that water quality in rivers is broadly acceptable, with the exception of a few black spots, which the last river pollution survey showed. That is, I think, confirmed.<lb/>
I might, in passing, say a word of congratulation to the 10 regional water authorities on what they have achieved in 10 years in bringing the inland waters&#x2014;the rivers of this country&#x2014;up to a high standard and the massive effort that they have put into transforming 1,400 rural and urban sewage authorities into 10 efficient regional water authorities covering the whole country. A great deal of the equipment that they took over was inefficient and extremely incapable of doing its job.<lb/>
I am, therefore, happy to say that the present water position looks good. What has happened in practice is that the water authorities have concentrated first on inland water, where there was a good deal of serious pollution 10 years ago, because that has the most immediate impact on human health, not least on account of the large element of re-use of water that exists in this country. They were right to give that priority. Thus, the coastal waters and estuaries with which this report particularly deals took second place, except for the two major estuaries of the Thames and the Tyne, which have been treated as national priorities at a very high cost but with exceptionally good results. In the meantime, some improvement has been made in discharges to estuaries and coastal waters, though inevitably constrained by the limits on water authorities' annual capital budgets.<lb/>
Against this background I turn to the Royal Commission's recommendation 7.45, which asks Her Majesty's Government to set a date by which all&#x2014;I underline "all"&#x2014;crude discharges of sewage to the sea should cease or be disposed of by long sea outfalls. That is an admirable objective. The report does not state how many there are, nor what the estimated cost would be. The report approves of long sea outfalls with suitable comminutors as an acceptable method of disposing of raw sewage. In my humble judgment, provided that toxic wastes are removed from industrial wastes, I agree with this view. However, what I cannot agree with is an immediate commitment to deal with all coastal discharges in this way. Each one would cost millions of pounds. Almost every town and village round our coast discharges raw sewage through a short sea outfall, often not clearing low tide level. The fact is that our nineteenth century ancestors saw this as a cheap and simple method of disposal of sewage. There are hundreds, probably thousands, of them. Of course, the Royal Commission is right. They are insanitary and unpleasant. But the remedy will be a big, long-term programme, costing billions of pounds.<lb/>
For us in Britain, I can only say that there are two consolations-for what they are worth. Our coasts are washed by powerful currents which, in the main, keep them clean. We are very lucky. In comparison, our fellow Europeans in France and Italy have at least as unpleasant a heritage as us, with the disadvantage that the Mediterranean coasts are virtually without currents and coastal pollution is much heavier.<lb/>
<col>370</col>
I now turn to the Royal Commission's major related recommendation&#x2014;7.39&#x2014;that Part II of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, referred, should be implemented by July 1986. As the noble Baroness rightly said, all Governments have been guilty of procrastination here. In the event, Her Majesty's Government were pretty smart following publication of this report because they published in August of this year their intention to implement Part II by the end of next year, 1985. That is very good so far as it goes.<lb/>
But, inevitably, in the publication letter the Department of the Environment has reserved power to grant deemed consents which, I should explain to the uninitiated, mean permission for dischargers to continue doing what they are doing and for discharges to continue at existing levels where they are considered justified. Obviously, a great many coastal and estuarial discharges will have to be dealt with in this way for some years to come. This is no more than a discreet acknowledgment that we cannot proceed faster in this field than our national resources will allow. That is reality. I must confess that in supporting this line I am being no more than realistic, but I doubt whether the Royal Commission would so accept it. I think that they will have something to say when they come to their next report.<lb/>
After being rather critical of the Royal Commission's recommendation in this respect, I am glad to be able to support two minor recommendations with regard to coastal waters. Recommendation 7.47 is that the selection criteria for the classification of bathing beaches in Britain should be reviewed. I agree. At present only 27 of our beaches have been classified as bathing beaches. Even the Netherlands, with its short coastline, has classified 60. We are in danger of looking ridiculous unless we carry out reclassification.<lb/>
Secondly, in recommendation 7.56, the commission recommends that the United Kingdom should support the European Commission's initiative for an international survey of North Sea pollution. In paragraphs 4.96 and 4.97 they express particular anxiety about the dumping at sea of sewage sludge, especially by the Thames Water Authority. In fact, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Thames Water Authority monitor very carefully the dumping of sewage at sea in approved dumping grounds. All the evidence shows not only that there is not growing pollution in that area, but that there is an improvement in the quality of the water and fish there. I heard from the Thames Water Authority today that it would welcome an independent international survey. The authority is sure that the record will show that what it is doing is good and right and that it is not doing any harm to anyone. I hope that my noble friend will be able to say that Her Majesty's Government will agree to give full support to it. I believe that this would give confidence to everyone's credibility.<lb/>
I conclude my comments on this aspect by saying that my recognition of the Royal Commission's invaluable role as a national watchdog to warn us against present and impending dangers is absolutely invaluable. Indeed, in the context of water pollution generally, inland as well as coastal, I strongly support the Royal Commission's contention that water
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0194"/>
<col>371</col>
authorities need more capital spending. My remarks are almost in line with those of the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, on this matter. Without some relief from the present financial stringency, not only can the admirable improvement achieved in inland waters&#x2014;in river water quality&#x2014;in the past decade not be maintained, but in some places pollution will begin to increase and quality will be lost. Unless some relief can be given to water authorities' capital budget, I fear that this situation will begin to show in the next national river pollution survey. I am sure that the Royal Commission is aware of this trend. They will probably comment on it in their next report. In the meantime, I hope that my noble friend will hear the message and heed it.<lb/>
I should like, if I may, to add a brief comment on the Select Committee's Report on Air Pollution, as I am a member of that Select Committee. I should like to begin by paying a very warm tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, who has been such an admirable chairman of that committee, and has dealt with a particularly difficult subject in what I think was a brilliant way, and to thank him for his comprehensive speech this afternoon. I feel that I should say a word on the emotive subject of acid rain, for two specific reasons which I will deal with as I proceed. Of course, I share in the common wish for a reduction. Our report discusses this matter in detail, analysing the present state of scientific knowledge.<lb/>
It is clear that the phenomenon known as acid rain is very complex and not yet completely understood. It follows, therefore, that cure and prevention cannot at present be precisely defined. In our report we recognise that man-made emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide make a contribution to acid rain and that therefore the Commission's proposal for a reduction would be in the general interest; our final recommendation takes account of this. What we could not accept&#x2014;I am repeating some of what the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, said because I believe it is of absolute, cardinal importance&#x2014;was the statement in the Commission's explantory memorandum, at page 19, that there is a linear relationship between the levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and the quantity of acid depositions.<lb/>
Our report, in paragraph 104, which I commed to noble Lords, deals with this point in detail. We give convincing scientific authority for our view that the linear relationship between sulphur dioxide emissions and acid rain is not confirmed. Very important consequences flow from this conclusion as to what measure of money and resources should be allocated to the reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions. Our report shows that, as the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, has explained, there are broadly two forms of action to reduce these emissions; one is preventive and the other is remedial. We describe in detail the implications of these alternatives for the Central Electricity Generating Board who are the main emitters for this purpose.<lb/>
It is obvious that the remedial measures are greatly to be preferred, except for their long time-scale. They consist of the introduction into steam boilers, which are coal fired, of these pressurised fluid bed combustors about which the noble Lord has told us.
<col>372</col>
This can be done only in new power stations which are not programmed until the turn of the century. They are both cost-effective and energy conserving, and substantially reduce sulphur dioxide. They do everything we want.<lb/>
The preventive measures, which can be introduced to existing generating stations within the next few years, are the flue gas desulphurisation process which the noble Lord also explained. This is costly in money and wasteful in fuel consumption. I confirm entirely the figures which the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, gave. The Central Electricity Generating Board told us that to fit 12 large stations would cost about &#x00A3;2 billion in capital sums. Add &#x00A3;350 million a year to running costs and 5 per cent. to electricity charges and one sees that this is formidable.<lb/>
Our report concludes that this very heavy cost is not justified when it is not certain to what extent the reduction of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions will reduce acid rain. However, we recognise that a reduction of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions would be generally beneficial, including probably some reduction in acid rain, and therefore we recommend retrofitting FGD to two main generating stations, achieving a 30 per cent. reduction&#x2014;that is far from what the Commission proposes&#x2014;plus the commitment to perfecting the pressurised fluid bed combustors, if possible getting them started before the turn of the century.<lb/>
In making this recommendation we have also borne in mind the Commission's policy to encourage the use of indigenous coal as a source of energy and the continuing need for the maximum economy in the use of energy. Both of those are in conflict with the FGD fitting. I have dealt with this in detail, although the noble Lord has done so, because our recommendation is a modification in an important way of the Commission's proposal and also because, since our report last June, the House of Commons Select Committee on Environment has published its report on this important subject and has recommended adopting the Commission's full proposal involving retrofitting of FGD in 12 main stations; despite, I should add, acknowledging in its report, at paragraph 130, that the linear relationship is problematical.<lb/>
Obviously it is a matter of judgment, at a very high level, as to where one should come down in this very emotive issue of acid rain. But I felt glad to see, as I am sure my noble friend Lord Nathan did, that the Royal Commission's Report, in paragraph 5.96, after saying that they had given only a brief study to it, came down on the same recommendation as we did&#x2014;that the right thing would be to fit two stations as we have recommended and achieve a 30 per cent. reduction. I hope that our report will be an assistance to Parliament, an assistance to the Government, and indeed to the Commission, in dealing with this very complex subject.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01786"><member>Lord Flowers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, everyone who has ever been a member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution&#x2014;there are about 40 of us by now&#x2014;owes a tremendous personal debt to the noble Lord, Lord Ashby. The noble Lord, Lord Nathan, has said that it was my noble friend who provided the initial leadership and who charted a course that has
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0195"/>
<col>373</col>
been followed ever since, under different chairmen but with remarkable consistency. He also set standards of eloquent exposition that have been extremely difficult to follow, as they are today.<lb/>
The simplest thing for me to do in these circumstances would be to say that I completely agree with what my noble friend has said to your Lordships, and to sit down. There are, however, one or two points where I should like to add a little emphasis to what my noble friend has said. The first of these concerns the concept of "best practicable means" which underlies the whole British approach to pollution control. It is not the easiest thing in the world to explain to the uninitiated and especially to those who are more accustomed to the idea of statutory controls, because its starting point is the effect that actual emissions actually have on the actual environment rather than the theoretical effects they might have in hypothetical conditions; and it calls for the exercise of judgment in deciding whether a particular method of control is practicable in all the circumstances of a particular case, including the likely costs of adopting it. It is a flexible approach made possible only because the pollution inspectorates and the industries concerned are mostly willing to work in partnership to keep pollution within reasonable bounds. It is a pragmatic approach and, as the Tenth Report makes clear, it has been justified by results.<lb/>
It was in the Fifth Report, as my noble friend has reminded us, that we generalised the basic concept of "best practicable means" which had been originally introduced in the context of air pollution, to "best practicable environmental option" in order to deal with cases in which the effect of pollution control may be to transfer the pollutant, as we have already heard, from one medium to another&#x2014;for example, from smokey air to dirty rivers or from polluted water to toxic solids&#x2014;and where it is therefore the total effect upon the environment that has to be considered. It was a natural extension of the original idea, one that I am glad to see the Royal Commission has continued to build upon. It has largely been adopted by now, even though the Government have so far declined to make its implementation as effective as it might be. I shall continue to hope that the industrial air pollution inspectorate, in spite of its name, will gradually assume the broader mantle we envisaged in the Fifth Report. It is difficult to see how it can do its job otherwise.<lb/>
Now, in the Tenth Report, we find a further extension of the concept in the guise of the "best environmental timetable", and I shall be interested to hear how the Minister reacts to it. As I understand it, it is essentially, something of extra guidance on what is meant by "practicable". In spite of my admiration for the way in which pollution control works in this country, I sometimes have my doubts about how long it takes to bring it about. If the concept of a best environmental timetable can be used to reduce delays, that will be a very good outcome. If it proves useful, it will probably be as a result of industrial firms being encouraged to make investment decisions that take proper account of pollution control from the beginning&#x2014;in other words, to plan ahead. Planning is meaningless unless it takes place within a well-defined timescale. On reading their report I therefore
<col>374</col>
wondered whether the Royal Commission could not have conveyed the essential idea in the still broader concept of a "best planning timescale". That is a concept that is being explored further at the present time by the Nuffield Foundation in a study of the town and country planning system.<lb/>
My second point concerns energy. The Tenth Report speaks kindly of the work of the Standing Commission on Energy and the Environment, and I am grateful that my noble friend has also lent his support. It is a matter close to the heart of the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, although I hope that he will forgive me if today I do not contribute to the discussion of his Select Committee report. It was originally recommended that the Standing Commission on Energy and the Environment should be:
<quote>"a high-level independent body to provide advice on energy strategy, taking account of economic, social, technical and environmental considerations".</quote>
It was set up, albeit with narrower terms of reference (reasons for which I shall not go into now), and it produced a report on coal and the environment that some have said should be compulsory reading for those engaged on either side in the present coal dispute.<lb/>
The Government, it seems, do not much care to look at matters of policy in such a broad context; so that commission is defunct, at any rate for the time being, when it happens to be needed. In the Tenth Report the Royal Commission recommend that the Standing Commission on Energy and the Environment should be reconstituted with the terms of reference originally proposed, saying that no existing body, including themselves, or inter-departmental machinery within Government, can adequately carry out the task.<lb/>
If your Lordships will bear with me for a few moments longer I should like to mention a few of the ways in which this lamentable coal dispute has implications for the environment. They are not perhaps the most important implications, but they will illustrate the point that the Royal Commission is making. In the coal report we recommended that, wherever possible, coal should be carried by rail instead of by road and that power station sites should be chosen with that in mind. It was a recommendation with which I think few would have quarrelled. The first result of the pickets however was to drive a lot of coal back onto the roads. When the strike is over, I doubt&#x2014;although I wish it could be otherwise&#x2014;whether power station and steel works operators will ever again be willing to forgo the relative flexibility and security of road transport. The consequences for our major roads and for all those who use them or live near them will be very great.<lb/>
After examining all the evidence, we considered that pollution controls and available technology were sufficiently good that we could give positive encouragement to the increased use of coal by industry. It was a means of conserving oil supplies and of reducing costs. It could even lead to a reduction in the level of sulphur dioxide emissions. There was a big campaign to burn more coal, and the beginnings of a flourishing trade in modern coal-burning appliances. Now our power stations are once again burning oil,
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0196"/>
<col>375</col>
and a few weeks ago I read in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> that 1,000 industrial firms have already turned back to oil. Once again, I doubt&#x2014;although I wish it could be otherwise&#x2014;whether it will be possible to reverse that trend. The environment will be the loser, together with the miners.<lb/>
Great Britain is densely populated and resplendent with sensitive and beautiful countryside. It is not the sort of place where opencast mining can be allowed to develop without the most stringent controls. We recommended that as the older, more unprofitable and less environmentally acceptable deep mines are closed and more efficient and profitable operations take their place, the volume of opencast mining should be allowed to decline. In the face of the miners' action, the civil engineering contractors who carry out opencasting are straining to produce as much coal as they can. The environment, as well as the miners, will be the loser.<lb/>
One of the most difficult issues of environmental policy is the place of nuclear power with all the uncertainties that surround it in the public mind. I well remember the days of which the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, has spoken. For many years the miners have strongly opposed the expansion of the nuclear industry. Of course, one is entitled to suspect that their motives had more to do with the preservation of their jobs than with the concern for public health on the basis of which they pressed their case. No matter. Few things could have been better advertisement for the nuclear industry than the steadfast reliability it has demonstrated in recent months in the face of a strike that was intended to paralyse our electricity supplies and bring our economy to a halt. However much anxiety is displayed at Sizewell, that is a record of achievement that the public are unlikely to forget when the future of the electricity industry is next debated. In this case the environment will be the winner, in some respects at any rate, because nuclear power at least does not produce sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide.<lb/>
Finally, we were at one with the Royal Commission which, in its Fourth Report, had declared that land dereliction should be regarded as a form of pollution. Dereliction resulting from subsidence and spoil tipping has been one of the more frightful side effects of intensive deep mining techniques as practised in the past, especially in the coalfields of South Wales and Yorkshire. Most of it is associated with pits that can by no stretch of the imagination be regarded as economic. It is just these pits that have to be closed for environmental as well as economic reasons. But these are also the pits around which have developed the tightknit communities that are the public image of the industry and have precious little to offer by way of alternative employment. We were careful to stress that the social problems of such communities, faced with almost total unemployment, would have to be treated with great sensitivity. They were not, and the resulting hostility, appalling though it is, was a predictable result. In this case it is the whole nation that is the loser.<lb/>
It was that incomparable physicist, Albert Einstein, who said that the environment is everything that is not me. It is impossible to consider environmental

problems narrowly, and I hope that my little excursion into a topical problem may at least have illustrated that. Discussions about energy policy have to be broadly based, particularly because of the immensity of the problems that they raise, the social costs of dealing with those problems, and sometimes because of international implications. However, energy is only one of the great issues of the day. Sir Richard Southwood and his fellow commissioners have amply demonstrated the need for vigilance and for painstaking scholarship in assessing the condition of the environment in all its many aspects. We are greatly in their debt for the clarity and courage with which they continue to spell that out.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01788"><member>The Earl of Cranbrook</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a privilege to follow the noble Lord, Lord Flowers, himself a past chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, of which I am a present member. As a present member, it is gratifying to note the quality and number of your Lordships who are contributing to the debate this afternoon. I should like briefly to pay a personal tribute to the leadership of Sir Richard Southwood, the Chairman of the Commission, who has played such an important part in tracing the course of the compendious report which is the subject of this debate tonight. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, for his able chairmanship of the report of the European Community's Committee, of which I am also a member.<lb/>
As a member of both these bodies I feel that I have had what could be regarded as a very adequate chance to say my piece, and I do not think it is appropriate to enlarge at any great length on these reports. I want to devote a few moments simply to one particular topic that has already been raised several times, and not least by the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, in introducing the debate this afternoon; that is to say, the present position of the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate, the IAPI.<lb/>
The report of the Royal Commission at paragraph 3.31 says:
<quote>"none of our latest findings appears to us to call into question the view expressed in the Fifth Report that the transfer of responsibility for the Alkali Inspectorate from the Department of the Environment to the Health and Safety Executive was misconceived."</quote>
If we pause to parse, or try to translate that into some other European language, I think we shall all agree that the editorial red pencil could more usefully have been applied to this statement. I think that it is perhaps because of the contortions of the phraseology that I note that this statement has been misinterpreted as excessive mildness in some quarters. Therefore, it is worth while to spend a few moments discussing briefly the present arrangements for the administration of the IAPI and stressing the commission's opinion that there is a need for review and the probable transfer of the IAPI back to the Department of the Environment.<lb/>
The evidence which I received personally as a member of the Royal Commission has been brought sharply into focus by the News Release of the Health and Safety Executive dated 13th September 1984. This was drawn to my attention by the National Society for Clean Air. I know that the National Society for Clean Air membership and executive share some of the anxieties which I express.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0197"/>
<col>377</col>
That is not in any way to criticise this News Release from the HSE. It is in fact a valuable document, and it points to a considerable achievement in combining a previous diversity of inspectorates into a common executive for the protection of people in the workplace. The Health and Safety Executive has successfully united the Factories Inspectorate, the Mines and Quarries and the Nuclear Installation Inspectorates, the Agricultural Inspectors, the approval service for electrical equipment in flammable atmospheres, and, of course, the Alkali Inspectorate, on the IAPI.<lb/>
It cannot but be clear that the IAPI is the odd man out in this list. It is the only inspectorate which is not in fact directly concerned with the health of people in the workplace. It is concerned with the health of the environment outside the workplace. As I read the News Release of the HSE, I see that the rationale being followed is clearly that which was laid out in a 1980 memorandum used by the HSE called the <i>Health and Safety Executive Future Organisation</i>. May I say in tribute to the Library service of your Lordships' House that this was retrieved for me today by the Library despite the fact that once again the GLC scientific computer is down or out, or whatever computers are when they choose not to compute for you. This had to be abstracted manually by old-fashioned techniques of looking through lists and hurrying to a shelf. I am grateful to the librarians of this House for finding this paper for me this afternoon.<lb/>
This memorandum speaks in terms of matrix management, a common system of recruiting, a common grading structure, common geographical areas of responsibility, and it is clear from the News Release that this is what has successfully been operated in the HSE. But this raises some anxieties. However desirable it may be to have a common grading structure in organisational terms, is this going to function to maintain the special expertise of the IAPI within the Health and Safety Executive?<lb/>
If, as it appears from the recent memorandum, the HSE has moved substantially towards an administrative structure in which there is a common grading system and a unitary promotions ladder, the position of IAPI staff seems to me to be in danger of becoming anomalous. The skills required by their service are not necessarily those of what we can conveniently call the "workplace arms" of their executive; and, of course, the converse is equally true. Therefore, I should like to ask my noble friend on the Front Bench, not necessarily to reply today but to at least feed into the system and to consider these questions. What safeguards exist to prevent the dilution of IAPI expertise within the system that has evolved? Will senior personnel be forced to move out of the IAPI into other arms in order to achieve the promotions that they deserve?<lb/>
I should like to ask my noble friend in more detail whether it is a fact, as has been rumoured, that two recent recruiting drives for the IAPI have been disappointing. Can this failure to attract the right quality of candidate be attributed to a state of somewhat low morale within the inspectorate? I should also like to ask my noble friend whether it is true, as I have heard, that the next chief inspector, who is of course due to take over in February of next year,
<col>378</col>
is likely to come from the Factory Inspectorate rather than from within the IAPI itself.<lb/>
It is agreed by all parties, including of course the Health and Safety Executive, that in the field of air pollution it is the Secretary of State for the Environment and the other environment Ministers who depend on the IAPI for relevant expert advice in the field of air pollution. The Government's response to the Fifth Report of the Royal Commission (Pollution Paper No. 18, 1982) in Appendix 1, included an elaborate "Memorandum of Understanding". This outlined the mechanisms by which the Health and Safety Commission would exercise its perceived responsibilities to the environment Ministers.<lb/>
To someone like myself, who has no direct experience of the workings of the Civil Service, the mechanisms proposed seem quite archaic and potentially obstructive to the direct and ready communication between the Ministers and the inspectorate that is needed to provide the information and the skills in confronting the complicated and ever changing problems in the real world of air pollution. Looking at these various documents, I cannot but believe that it would not be far simpler and far more effective to return the IAPI to the Department of the Environment.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ashby, has stressed that the BPEO must be the major concern of future pollution control programmes. It was gratifying also to hear him commend the latest brainchild of the Commission, the best environmental timetable, which I cannot believe is widely divergent from the best planning timescale of the noble Lord, Lord Flowers, though perhaps this would be an interesting subject for debate over a number of lunchtimes. Environment Ministers in the future must have secure and ready access to the relevant expertise. This must be provided by the simplest and least devious route.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01790"><member>Lord Davies of Leek</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it has been a fascinating debate to listen to. The information given and the scientific understanding of the problem have been great. I want to pay tribute to noble Lords who have contributed, but I want to shunt this debate into another area of discussion so far as pollution is concerned. What is the debate about? It is a debate on the Tenth Report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, and on the problem of tackling pollution, experience, and prospects.<lb/>
Shunting this debate into that field I am going to take it briefly into areas brushed over about the mining industry, the miners, and the place of pollution in their lives, I shall not weary the House by speaking for a long time. I never have done that.<lb/>
It is interesting, too, that we seem to have a mania for road building. I note in passing that Churchill, when advocating public ownership of the railways, said:
<quote>"I contend that they should be considered from the military point of view, too, as part of our security and defence, particularly because of our immolation on the railways&#x2014;sacrificial victims of the internal combustion engine".</quote>
The internal combustion engine is already accused, and rightly so, of having killed 50,000 people in America in 1978, and 2,300,000 were hospitalised;
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0198"/>
<col>379</col>
and we are talking about pollution. There can be no greater pollution than the quick death of some of our people from man's own inventions. I do not want to be a Luddite and say that we must stop that technical progress; nevertheless we have to consider the situation for human beings.<lb/>
Our road safety record in Britain is one of the best in the world: 5,900 people were killed here in 1982; 11,626 were killed in Germany; more than 8,600 in Italy; 12,400 in France; and as I have said, 50,000 killed in America and 2,300,000 were hospitalised. There cannot be greater pollution that that&#x2014;right to the death. We seem not to take any notice. Yet we say that we cannot do anything but privatise the railways. We must build roads. So we have a mania for building these deathtraps which we call the highways and roads of Great Britain, and they are polluting the country as much as anything can.<lb/>
The Command Paper 9149 is only one of many over years of work that have been presented to this House and the committee. Able, assiduous and persevering people have for many years presented us with their findings. The findings have been great, the knowledge has been deep, the erudition has been visible. But there has been paucity of action over the years. Why?&#x2014;because of the cost. We take the economics of the cost&#x2014;not the social economics; just the profit and loss account. We consider the balance sheet and forget the social cost in tackling pollution.<lb/>
In many respects we in Britain are the laggards compared with some of our European friends. This is particularly true of our meagre effort to limit the maiming, and sometimes deadly, effects of exhaust emissions and the consequent brain damage to our children from the vapours from the exhaust pipes of our internal combustion engines. At Spaghetti Junction, where there has been an analysis of pollution, children have suffered from lead poisoning. We do nothing about it because it is too expensive. We work it on the basis of a balance sheet, rather than the social costs to society.<lb/>
Since our accession to the European Community we have been obliged to increase our efforts to cope with the growing menace of pollution. In 1970 we appointed a standard body to deal with and advise us on home and foreign pollution of the environment. This body was to be an independent body not circumvented by&#x2014;those were the words&#x2014;or influenced by any departments. I asked how far that <i>caveat</i> would apply to the military. Immediately one comes not to a permanent stop, but to a halt for more thinking.<lb/>
When dealing with nuclear weapons and the possibility of pollutants of carcinogenic effects and the propinquity of it, will the plea that an increase in nuclear defences is essential to our security prevent caution? Are we cautious, or will our independence be limited?<lb/>
Many of the artefacts of modern man can in themselves be a danger to all plant, animal and river life. Our teeming oceans have become dumps for death-dealing waste of all kinds. It is no good talking rubbish about increasing the number of nuclear power stations and denigrating the fellows who cut coal. The
<col>380</col>
more power stations we have, the more radioactive waste we have to dump. The Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world and its fish are already contaminated. Our teeming oceans, as I said, are becoming dumps for dealing with wastes of all kinds.<lb/>
As a civilised Government we have a duty to keep the public informed, to give them objective advice on the consequences of pollution. On sea and ocean dumping there is a conspiracy of silence. That conspiracy must be broken down. It is not wilfully done. It is sometimes thought that it is not wise for people to know. That is a very different jesuitical approach from the conspiracy of silence. We need more open government to protect the rights of the people.<lb/>
The steady, insidious entrapping of man, plants and animals by the increase of radioactivity spreading over the earth from our power stations and the effluent from them gives us, as a result, the seas that I have talked about where the very food that God has given to mankind, namely fish, has been contaminated.<lb/>
The so-called experts brush aside these warnings. They sometimes laugh and they are more pompous and arrogant than our economists with their intellectual dandyism overwhelming their common sense more often than not. The predictions of <i>Old Moore's Almanac</i> are often 10 times better than most of the sinister predictions of the economists about the balance of payments. A cynic once said:
<quote>"The Nuclear Boffins (God bless 'em all)</quote>
<quote>Have calculated the fall-out to a decimal.</quote>
<quote>But my nephew and niece</quote>
<quote>Have five legs apiece</quote>
<quote>And their intellect's infinitesimal".</quote>
In other words, this kind of thing is going on and no one worries about it. There is the possibility of mutation of human beings.<lb/>
How do we deal with this situation? On the major issue of pollution in general Dr. Harold G. Wolf of Cornell Medical Centre in New York believed that the health of an individual was bound up with the adaptive demands placed on him by his environment. To me this was axiomatic. One only has to look at the Eskimo, or the nomad of the desert, and straight away one can see that it is an axiom; an example of a fact of life.<lb/>
One of the great problems of today is the high velocity of change which in itself is a factor of pollution. Those in my age group are finding it very difficult to keep up. Let me take a typical example: cupidity and greed, partly fostered by the insecurity that is burgeoned by this modern South Sea bubble of "Buy a newspaper and become a millionaire". That is daft from the beginning, if one knows the mathematics of the chance, but we are all becoming affected by it. It must be the lead in the atmosphere that is making people think so daft! Any sixth form boy who has done elementary mathematics could state the chances.<lb/>
At the same time our chinmey stacks vomit into the sky poison and abrasive fumes, filling the skies, rivers and seas. Nevertheless, while we must not be Luddites and suppress our labour saving technology and the ease and dignity that it brings to us, we should have the courage to spend more on the prevention of the effects of our pollution. But before we do it, we always have an arithmetical balance sheet, forgetting the social
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0199"/>
<col>381</col>
consequences. Most of society, as I said years ago, is sitting in the caboose looking backwards. Thus we are in danger of losing control of our environment on sea and land. We are shocked by the accelerating rate of change, and that in itself is pollution.<lb/>
A sick nostalgia about the past is useless. Pollution is now a world problem, fundamentally more dangerous than the colonial wars, or even the big wars that we have had. If we fail to cope with this phenomenon, then modern civilisation is in danger. The modern combustion engine adds carnage to its polluting effects on society. There is the stigma of our road deaths which in themselves are the mightiest of all pollutions. Despite the fact that, as I have said, our road safety record is one of the best in the world, the stigma is there nevertheless and something should be done about it as soon as possible.<lb/>
The problem of pollution and radioactive waste is increasing; so much so that John Bright said many years ago:
<quote>"Death stands at attention, obedient, expectant, ready to shear away the peoples <i>en masse;</i> ready, if called on, to pulverise without hope of repair what is left of civilisation. He awaits only the word of command".</quote>
That was a semi-prophecy of John Bright, years and years ago.<lb/>
The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee last week published its fifth annual report, which gives particular attention to the Sellafield nuclear processing plant. Two accidents were staged to demonstrate to the public the safety of the containers carrying nuclear waste. They were a waste of time. It ultimately transpired that the experiments were of little value, though they were supposed to demonstrate the so-called safety of moving radioactive cylinders. Discharges are increasing, particularly, as I said earlier, into the Irish Sea and, sad to say, Sellafield discharges are not any less. In fact, carelessness is proven by the fact that this week British Nuclear Fuels is being prosecuted under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 for failure to keep proper records and failure to keep radioactive discharges into the sea as low as is reasonably possible. What are we to do about this? We do not give enough information.<lb/>
Finally, my Lords, in our mining valleys in Wales and in England, too, pollution is taken for granted. The mining people from time to time have suffered its horrendous and terrifying consequences. Some noble Lords will have realised that we have polluted our mountains and quarries with the waste from our coal mines and have polluted our seas by running coal slurry and dust into our rivers. In considering the cost of this pollution&#x2014;before what I have said is contradicted&#x2014;let us remember the moving coal tip at Aberfan in 1966. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Edmund-Davies, was chairman of the tribunal which examined and inquired into the Aberfan disaster. It was in 1966 when the village school and its children&#x2014;sons and daughters of the miners&#x2014;were swallowed by the moloch of the mines, a moving coal tip. It started sliding down and it inundated and overwhelmed that tiny mountainside school. And still testifying to that slaughter are the graves on the hillside at Aberfan, the graves of children of the so-called enemy within. Here was the terror of man's unthink-
<col>382</col>
ing pollution of his environment, fouling God's good earth.<lb/>
Note, too, my Lords, the poisonous substances used on our farms, fields and hedgerows, and the menace of willy-nilly spraying. At last the Poisonous Substances (Agriculture) Regulations now demand control. At last we are beginning to try, and in trying&#x2014;I mean this sincerely, having listened to this debate today&#x2014;some tribute should be paid to the debates that we have had in the House of Lords. I still consider this Chamber a bastion of democracy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01791">5.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01792"><member>Lord Craigton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not easy, with one simple point to raise, for me to follow the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek. But is it not good to see him back in such health and vigour again? I have to thank the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, for giving me an opportunity to raise the one point that I very urgently want to raise. Chapter III, paragraph 3.48 of the Tenth Report of the Royal Commission says:
<quote>"We foresee growing pressure &#x2026; for greater use of statutory measures, to ensure effective implementation of European Community requirements".</quote>
It goes on:
<quote>"For instance, the non-statutory Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme (PSPS) depends for its effectiveness on the voluntary cooperation of the agrochemicals industry &#x2026; [which was] welcomed by the Commission in its Seventh Report [has] run into difficulties".</quote>
Chapter II, paragraph 2.63 of the Tenth Report says:
<quote>"pesticides are an important area where practice is out of line with the more extensive requirements of Part II of the Control of Pollution Act. The recommendations of the Seventh Report &#x2026; would help remove that anomaly".</quote>
So I shall first state the present position and then seek advice from the Seventh Report. The manufacturers' code of practice, raised in the Seventh Report and a cause for concern in the Tenth Report, has now run into difficulty. The basis of that code has been held to be illegal under Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome since it prevents or restricts competition within the Common Market. We now have to welcome the move that the Government are making to introduce, in its place, controls which will have the force of law.<lb/>
On 22nd June, MAFF made an announcement to this effect and with it circulated a seven-page paper with some 20 paragraphs outlining details. The proposal is to introduce a Bill which enables Ministers to make regulations which will take the place of the voluntary scheme. Understandably, there are a number of doubts and queries. These centre, as is normal, on the contents of the regulations as outlined in some detail by the MAFF circular. If the Bill comes first and the regulations come later, we shall have to ensure that the Bill itself contains provision for the regulations to meet the points that are worrying us.<lb/>
I have quoted where the Tenth Report referred with some concern to the need for action on the recommendations of the Seventh Report about the Pesticide Safety Precautions Scheme. I now refer to one aspect of this matter which in the Seventh Report occupied seven paragraphs covering four pages, Nos. 73 to 76, and about which, as I shall show, they even then called for urgent action. The vital point at issue is the type of spray used by ground vehicles and aircraft to squirt
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0200"/>
<col>383</col>
crops with diluted chemicals under pressure through a nozzle. It is this point to which Chapter III devotes those four pages. Furthermore, exactly the same subject is dealt with by a book, published this year, by the Soil Association entitled <i>Pall of Poison</i>, the author of which on Wednesday week, 7th November, will be speaking about it to the all-party Conservation Committee of both Houses of Parliament.<lb/>
What then is this vital problem? Traditional sprays produce a range of droplet sizes, from large ones, which may be 1,000 microns or more in diameter and which tend to roll off the plant and pollute the soil, to very small drops, a few microns in diameter, which never reach the ground and probably finish up, as do dust particles of similar size, in the stratosphere or in our lungs. These tiny droplets, up to 100 microns, represent about 20 per cent. of the total volume used and, as about one billion gallons a year are sprayed, this 20 per cent. totals some 200 million gallons. That is a lot of poison to be wasted in the atmosphere. But in addition to conventional sprays, two improved techniques are available. They are CDA (Controlled Drop Application) which eliminates most of the very large and very small drops, and ULV (Ultra Low Volume) which cuts down liquid volume requirements by producing uniformly small drops. On these two improved techniques the Seventh Report, in paragraph 3.92, had this to say in 1979&#x2014;since when further improvements will undoubtedly have been made:
<quote>"We were informed that if ULV/CDA techniques could be perfected and generally adopted, their use might lead in time to a reduction of up to 25 per cent. in the total quantity of active ingredients used for the pesticides concerned. This would be a notable environmental gain. It would also represent a gain for the farmer".</quote>
They add in paragraph 3.95:
<quote>"The potential advantages offered &#x2026; are such that we wish to see more work proceed on the development and assessment of these techniques with considerably more urgency than we have discerned among the organisations involved".</quote>
I regret not only that I detect no urgency in the proposals now circulated by the Minister but they do not even mention this matter at all. I will give two examples. Only the pesticides require the approval of the nine government departments and agencies concerned. In paragraph 18, which lists the purposes for which pesticides may be used, the granting or refusal of use is specifically limited to pesticides. The proposed legislation appears to give no place&#x2014;no place at all&#x2014;to the consideration of the methods and devices for delivering the spray. No powers are to be taken to specify droplet sizes or to inspect delivery devices or to seize and dispose of those that do not conform. No powers are to be taken to grant or refuse approval of a delivery device or to institute efficiency testing of spraying machinery. Surely all these powers must be in the Bill or in the regulations. The use of the most economical and effective delivery devices is as important to the land and people of Britain as the control and specification of the chemicals that they have to deliver.<lb/>
Even in 1979, the Seventh Report spoke in paragraphs 3.96 and 3.97 of the absence of and the need for performance data to be established for spreading machines as it had been, under the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme, for pesticides. The
<col>384</col>
report finishes its lengthy review on this subect by saying, in paragraph 3.97:
<quote>"The time may come when pesticides will not be cleared for present day conventional spraying if other techniques, such as ULV/CDA have proved equally safe, more efficient and preferable on environmental grounds".</quote>
My Lords, that time will never come unless, contrary to the present proposals, the now proposed Bill and regulations give powers to make this happen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01793">5.25 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01794"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am tempted to pursue&#x2014;I will not call it a hare, but the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Craigton; I shall, however, forbear to do so and I hope we shall have a chance of talking about it in the not-too-distant future. I should like to deal, if I may, with the rather more general problem of pollution however it may be defined.<lb/>
Pollution, of course, has been with us from time immemorial. Whether in fact the apple in the Garden of Eden was a pollutant or whether the serpent was a pollutant is a matter for theological or historical discussion, but undoubtedly there has been pollution of a more or less serious kind ever since civilisation arrived on this planet, because pollution and civilisation, I would suggest to your Lordships, do in fact go hand in hand. I am using the word "civilisation" in its more or less literal sense&#x2014;when people stopped living in their widely separated huts, shacks and caves and came together to live in cities and larger groups. They would then by their very propinquity create pollution; they would disturb the environment in a way which was often dangerous to health, and certainly unpleasant for their neighbours if not for themselves.<lb/>
We have only to read, coming to much more recent times, of the pollution of the City of London which was mentioned by Pepys in his diaries. I have a letter from John Ruskin, written to my father, in which he complains of the pollution of the air by the cigar smoke of the young of his generation. There are different types of pollution which have been with us all the time and which we have never to any serious extent complained about.<lb/>
I would suggest there are two reasons why we have not complained unduly seriously about them. One is that it is only fairly recently that we have come to realise that we can control our environment. Formerly it was just something which happened. It came from God, from natural causes, or from powerful neighbours. But there was nothing we could do about it; we had to grin and bear it. Now we realise that we can do something about it. We live in an age of lobbies and pressure groups, of very wise, good and devoted people, or some rather cranky people; and between them they have created a very strong group of lobbies which is trying to prevent some of the harm which has hitherto been done without any complaint other than a shrug of the shoulder.<lb/>
However, I would suggest that there is a more serious reason than this&#x2014;although that is an important one in itself&#x2014;and it is a three-fold reason. The first part is the rise of the great international, science-based corporations, with their vast expenditure on research and their development of new techniques. The second is the overwhelming power of advertising, persuading people rapidly to adopt the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0201"/>
<col>385</col>
new technique, whatever it may be. The third is the spread of education at all levels, which makes people more interested in new techniques, more anxious to get away from the old and tried methods of their grandfathers, and to develop something new in their own enterprise.<lb/>
Agriculture gives a very good example of this. It has happened very rapidly. Within my own farming memory, I look back to a time when there was no research, to speak of, in chemicals. Insecticides and pesticides were unknown; artificial fertilisers were used by a very small number of progressive farmers in very small quantities; and no self-respecting farmer, unless he happened to be a particular innovator, would adopt a new technique until he had looked at it very carefully being tried by one of his neighbours, or possibly tried it out on a very small scale for several years on his own farm.<lb/>
All that has changed completely. We now have great international corporations, multinationals, which have brought enormous benefits to farming and, as a result of that, enormous benefits to the consumer in allowing food to be produced at prices which would be impossible without these new techniques. They spend vast sums of money on producing the type of insecticides and other poisons to which the noble Lord, Lord Craigton, has just referred, and having produced them, they spend even vaster sums, probably, on advertising them to make sure that the farming community knows what there is available and on doing their best to persuade farmers to buy them.<lb/>
The farmers themselves are far more educated in the modern techniques of farming than their forebears were and they do not wait to see what the progressive neighbour does. They do not try something gingerly in just one field, but go all out for it all over the whole farm, and the spread of the new techniques and the new poisons&#x2014;I deliberately call them that&#x2014;takes place at an alarming pace. That is a change which has possibly taken place most dramatically in farming, but undoubtedly in very many other spheres, too.<lb/>
This must call for a far greater awareness of the potential dangers, the lurking dangers, of the new techniques, which may not be apparent in the first two years, five years or possibly even 10 years and there is a greater need for the watchdog of some governmental agency to make sure that we are not building up for ourselves, whether it be in agriculture, whether it be in our generation of electricity, whether it be in the effluents from our drains and sewage systems or whether it be in the emissions of our internal combustion engines, something which is possibly lethal to a large number of people, and undoubtedly harmful and unpleasant to a very large number of people.<lb/>
What disturbs me when I read this admirable Tenth Report of the Royal Commission is the number of times that, in the politest and most civilised manner, it suggests that all is not well in this sphere. Let me quote from some of the summary of its recommendations. For instance, it states in paragraph 7.19:
<quote>"We believe that the United Kingdom should be less on the defensive and should play a more positive role in promoting environmental matters in the European Community.".</quote>
<col>386</col>
Later on that page it states:
<quote>"We regret the winding up of the Clean Air Council and the Noise Advisory Council and the putting into abeyance of the Commission on Energy and the Environment".</quote>
On the following page it states:
<quote>"We urge the Government and water authorities to take a longer-term view when setting future water quality targets"</quote>
and lower down it reads:
<quote>"The Department of the Environment should take a more central role in the development of a long-term research strategy for the water industry.".</quote>
At the bottom of page 185 it reads:
<quote>"We see no advantage in the negative approach which the United Kingdom has adopted to the implementation of the European Community shellfish waters Directive.".</quote>
On the following page the report states:
<quote>"The Government should respond positively to the initiatives of the Federal German Republic and the Commission of the European Communities concerning the North Sea &#x2026; The Department of the Environment should give greater recognition to the importance of long-term monitoring as a basis for action to improve air quality.".</quote>
Then on page 188 the report states:
<quote>"The Government should take the initiative through the European Community, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and other international agencies, to encourage a worldwide policy to restrict the use of gases &#x2026; which may deplete stratospheric ozone to essential purpose."</quote>
Page 189 reads,
<quote>"The Commission on Energy and the Environment should be reconstituted, but with wider terms of reference in accordance with the original recommendation in the Royal Commission's Sixth Report".</quote>
Finally, the report reads:
<quote>"Pollution control policy, and environmental policy generally, should be accorded, the priority and resources adequate for their integration in the national decision-making process, so that their potential benefits can be realised to the full and at least cost".</quote>
That is a pretty long list of gentle and polite criticisms, but it adds up to a fairly serious indictment, not of this Government&#x2014;this has been going on much too long; this happens to be the Government of the day&#x2014;but of all governments. Over the years that these developments have been taking place we have never looked with sufficient urgency and realism at the potential dangers which arise&#x2014;not just might arise&#x2014;and which will continue to arise as a result of the enormous technological upsurge that is taking place, and the enormous powers of those who produce these new methods to convince the users that they should use them immediately on a huge scale and not gently, watching step by step. That to my mind is the main lesson that I learned from reading this report.<lb/>
I have just two further relatively minor points. I note that there is a recommendation in Chapter II, paragraph 11, concerning straw burning. I do not want to go into that in any great detail. We have had debates on it in which I have deliberately not taken part. But a five-year period for research is highly unlikely to be sufficient to make it possible for all farmers on all types of soil to dispose of their straw in a satisfactory manner, without having recourse from time to time to burning. I think that we should keep this matter in perspective, unpleasant though it is&#x2014;whether one is an urban dweller, a weekender or a normal resident in a rural area, including farmers&#x2014;to be sitting out on a lovely August afternoon having your cup of tea and to be rained upon with black soot coming down. It is
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0202"/>
<col>387</col>
not very much fun and it is not much fun either for people who have done their washing to have soot coming down on their nice clean sheets. However, it does not happen on very many days in the year. In fact, my guess is that this year it has hardly happened, despite no prohibition. There are other ways by which it can be controlled. That matter ought to be kept in perspective. This is one point upon which I specifically disagree with the recommendations contained in the report.<lb/>
My other point relates to noise. This is mentioned in particular in both Chapter II, paragraph 2.5, and Chapter VI, paragraph 6.16. I believe that one of the greatest pollutants, by which I mean one of the greatest annoyances to the population as a whole, which does not cause damage to health though in certain cases it can cause psychological damage and increased stress&#x2014;which in itself has serious implications&#x2014;is noise. I very much hope that in their Eleventh Report the Royal Commission will show that they have taken the plunge and studied with the care they have devoted to all these other matters this enormously important problem of noise. The report is admirable. It is full of learned knowledge and sound common sense and balance. I join other speakers in expressing gratitude to those who have been responsible for it.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01796"><member>Lord Ironside</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, both the reports which we are debating today show that the EEC Commission is into acid rain. Like the common cold, it will not go away very easily. It is considered both here and in another place, whose environment committee's report is a useful complement to our discussion.<lb/>
First, my noble friend Lord Ridley has asked me to apologise on his behalf to the House for having to leave before he was able to speak. This was because he has another commitment elsewhere. Perhaps I may also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, on his able chairmanship of Sub-Committee G, of which I am a member.<lb/>
Your committee's approach to the acid rain issues is conditioned by the commission's rather contentious and far-reaching proposals for air pollution directives. Amendments to the various texts are now being negotiated, but I think the cause of concern that we all have is that any money which we are forced to spend, for it is our money, should be spent cost-effectively. The principle of preventing air pollution and controlling the man-made precursors of acid rain makes very good sense, provided that the relationships between cause and effect or between cost and effect, as the CBI has so succinctly put it, are understood. The alarms raised by Sir Walter Marshall over dealing with power station emissions are well founded, because the size of the investment and the long lead times mean that a great deal of money&#x2014;nearly &#x00A3;1,500 million&#x2014;could be put at risk and thereby wasted, unless he thinks there is some certainty that he can deliver.<lb/>
At the moment, with the degree of uncertainties, one is tempted to say: if in doubt, do nothing. But it is a bad posture to adopt when we are members of the European Community, which is a signatory to the Convention on Long-Range Trans-boundary Air Pollution. All the indications since 1972 are that
<col>388</col>
because of the magnitude of the problem preventive programmes must now be started in case, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, said, unwittingly we set off any time bombs that we have no way of stopping later on. That is how I read the position.<lb/>
Most of the attention in the committee's report focuses on the proposal for the large plant directive because it concerns power stations, even though some 450 industrial plants altogether in the United Kingdom would be affected by it. Although I like the idea of developing a cost-effective pollution policy based on the best practicable environmental option and the best environmental timetable, I am not convinced that the commission have succeeded in their proposals in getting the balance right between prevention and cure. This directly affects our investment in abatement technology as against investment in improved combustion, whether it is internal or external.<lb/>
The other point I want to make is about monitoring. If you wish to use public money to secure long-term benefits designed to improve the quality of life, you must carry public opinion along with you. The benefits being difficult to quantify in this case, public opinion can be very critical of the money which is spent. We already know of the troposphere, the stratosphere, the atmosphere and the biosphere, and all their pauses, and by definition the Royal Commission calls pollution the man-made alien substances and energy brought into all these spheres. So we now have a new concept of the pollutosphere, and we must face it. It is ready-made for a pollution inspectorate, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Ashby. We can already claim success in dealing with smoke from coal and sulphur dioxide from fuel combustion, with more to come, but the other precursors&#x2014;NOx, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ozone and elements which I have not heard about before but which are mentioned in the report of the Royal Commission&#x2014;aldehydes and peroxyacyl nitrates which are carcinogenic&#x2014;are the unseen and uncertain villains of the piece which are so difficult to monitor, as the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, said.<lb/>
To justify specific abatement measures while such great uncertainties exist between cause and effect, it does not in the least surprise me to see that the commission are proposing monitoring arrangements. Surely this must therefore mean that they are well aware of all the uncertainties, despite the flaws in the arguments they have advanced in the large plant directive, suggesting that there are linear connections. The point which needs to be made here is that the proposed monitoring arrangements will be very costly to set up. The commission are not the first people to be baffled by all the uncertainties of the atmosphere. We know that the Meteorological Office had to abandon the long range forecast because of the lack of understanding of atmosphere behaviour; so what assurances do we now have that the most expensive monitoring arrangements being proposed by the commission for central assessment by the Joint Research Centre at ISPRA are going to sort out what goes on in the atmosphere? The large plant directive is in line with the "polluter pays" principle, but the operator will pay twice over, as far as I can see, because he will be stung for the monitoring as well. The industrial plant directive, however, seems to be much
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0203"/>
<col>389</col>
more flexible in respect of monitoring requirements, but the member states will still have to pay and use comparative methods.<lb/>
The most awkward monitoring system seems to be that which is proposed for NO<sub>x</sub>. "First catch your pollutant", say the commission, "but we can't be certain that we've asked you to catch the right one". In setting up the monitoring network for the forestry protection regulation, 50 per cent. of the cost of monitoring will be provided. This to me immediately suggests a case for doing this for the other pollutants, especially if uncertainties exist. There is much to be said, therefore, for adopting the bubble regime in selected areas, with all its give and take, until the specific purposes of data collection can be determined and directed towards the causes.<lb/>
The Meteorological Office do not appear to have been drawn into the monitoring scene, despite their great experience of monitoring, but if data collection on the West Coast of Scotland, for example, is undertaken it will not mean anything unless the Meteorological Office can say what the atmospheric transport system across the Atlantic has done to the data. They have already found that the acidity of rain samples taken only a few feet apart at one of their sites differ by 40 per cent. Monitoring for monitoring's sake is expensive, and unless it is cause-related it will not prove to be effective. However, it is clear that local authorities will have to be invested with powers similar to those of the industrial air pollution inspectorate so that they can collaborate more closely and effectively with the enforcement agency in implementing the directives in whatever form they are adopted, as this will probably include monitoring.<lb/>
The United Kingdom's record in combating air pollution has been good, and the Government have also given assurances that they are to review air pollution control as a matter of priority. Even though air pollution monitoring policy in the United Kingdom is in a state of flux at the moment, I do not believe that we want to get drawn into creating a fancy monitoring network at the expense of industry, which is striving to improve process engineering to meet worldwide competition as well to achieve energy conservation and clean technology targets. Improved monitoring will not reduce pollution, but improved combustion will.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Nathan, made mention of the Act of 1825 applied in Derby, which required steam engines to consume their own smoke. I believe one can see that, in Derby, they are trying to do the same now. Indeed, the largest and most versatile burner test rig in the Western World&#x2014;rated at around 80 megawatts&#x2014;has been built in Derby by the Northern Engineering Industries International Combustion Company and will fire coal, oil, and coal/water mixtures; so Derby can boast quite a lot in this particular field now.<lb/>
On the road, the prevention and cure dichotomy with vehicle exhaust emissions has been brought to a head in Germany. But is it right to force motor manufacturers to fit expensive catalytic converters to their vehicles to achieve the NO, emission targets at too early a date, when it is known that they are into lean-burn engines and feel that this technology is a more cost-effective route to meeting the targets? What
<col>390</col>
is environmentally good can be industrially disastrous unless proper account is taken of the technical position and the lead times so that industry can respond and adjust its product range. Equally, in the large combustion plant field, is it right, therefore, to set such strict deadlines for FGD retro-fitting in the face of improved combustion developments which are likely to lessen NOx emissions and deal with sulphur absorption at lower cost than FGD without the energy penalty?<lb/>
We are told that 12 baseload stations, which are the largest emitters, require retro-fitting as being the only way of getting the 60 per cent. reduction requirement by 1995 at the enormous cost of between &#x00A3;1,400 and &#x00A3;1,500 million, because no new fossil-fired stations other than Drax will be commissioned before 1995. Added energy consumption to run these FGD plants would mean the loss of something like 663 megawatts of capacity&#x2014;which itself is the equivalent of a small power station.<lb/>
We must not forget that an FGD system for a power station is a large plant of power station proportions. It has its own management and control structure and a good response time to load change&#x2014;and a 2,000 megawatt generating station will keep two limestone lorries on the move 24 hours a day to handle nearly 4,000 tonnes of limestone per year. Other noble Lords have mentioned similar figures to those, which represent a very large quantity of limestone on the move.<lb/>
For SO<sub>2</sub> abatement, FGD technology has been around in the States and the Federal German Republic for many years. In Japan, Mitsubishi started it in the 1960s and can now claim that more than 50 of their environmentally-friendly wet limestone gypsum product systems are in service around the world. They have scaled their plant up to the size suited for United Kingdom power station use, whereas there are fewer of the Wellman-Lord wet limestone systems in service, which are rated by the Central Electricity Generating Board as their alternative choice.<lb/>
The elemental sulphur and sulphuric acid product of this process is marketable. Perhaps it is slightly less environmentally friendly but the plant has not yet been scaled up to suit our large stations. The CEGB are searching for proven technology, and they would be treading new ground with any dry systems such as Lodge-Cottrell, mentioned in our report. But perhaps the more serious problem is that they would face more complicated waste disposal problems and be dependent on United States company supply instead of British supply, which they can rely on for the wet systems such as Mitsubishi.<lb/>
Limestone is a good absorber for these suphur dioxide emitters and if we look at the erosion of the magnesian limestone of this palace building, we can see just how good it is. The directive in its present form means fitting 20,000 megawatts of plant in 10 years. Compare this with the achievement of the United States where, with all its resources, only 15,000 megawatts of plant has been fitted so far&#x2014;in fact, over the past 10 years&#x2014;which makes the commission's proposed programme look wildly optimistic and wholly unrealistic.<lb/>
In my view, the best practical environmental option for the United Kingdom is clearly one which must be
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0204"/>
<col>391</col>
technically acceptable and based on British supply&#x2014;with a home market policy designed to strengthen plant export opportunities. The best environmental timetable is one that does not give prior rights to abatement technology nor stifle improved combustion technology. With the uncertainties which exist in expert minds, the flexibility of the bubble system is, I believe, vital to the requirements of British industry in advancing combustion technology and getting new burners and boilers into service. Individual plant constraints will inhibit the innovation process. Pressurised fluid bed combustion and combined cycles are part of this process, and I hope that the commission, as well as the Government, will play its part in supporting these advanced developments so as to bring them to the market as quickly as possible.<lb/>
I expected throughout this inquiry that the issues would be narrowed down but found that the scientific uncertainties grew with the evidence that we heard. But I support the committee in their view that it would be foolish to take no action at all to combat air pollution until the uncertainties are resolved&#x2014;and I believe it would be wrong for the United Kingdom to stand aside from the EEC initiative. The main issue, as I said before, is to get the balance right between prevention and cure, between cost and effect, and&#x2014;eventually&#x2014;between cause and effect, so that we invest wisely.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01798"><member>Lord Sandford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I believe that we all owe a vote of thanks to my noble friend the Chief Whip for giving us this piece of prime time in which to debate these two important reports. I should like to begin by adding my congratulations to their authors&#x2014;Sir Richard Southwood and the noble Lord, Lord Nathan&#x2014;and to the noble Lords, Lord Ashby and Lord Nathan, for taking the opportunity to put down their Motions.<lb/>
I participate in this debate as the rather aged parent of the Control of Pollution Act and the Protection of the Environment Act, which are two different marques of the same Bill, which I dealt with in this House from two Front Benches in succession. I speak also as a rather idle member of Sub-Committee G but chiefly as president of the Association of District Councils, whose members employ some 3,300 of the environmental health officers. I mention them&#x2014;and I think I am the first noble Lord to do so&#x2014;because I think that your Lordships will agree with me that they are the highly trained, experienced, professional, front-line infantry in the battle against pollution. I mention them particularly, not only because they have a very significant role in all this&#x2014;a role which the Royal Commission thinks should be enlarged&#x2014;but because, like the noble Lord, Lord Shinwell, they have just become 100 years old. No doubt the Queen sent the noble Lord a telegram, and in the case of the environmental health officers she sent them their Royal Charter this summer. If I may speak on behalf of other noble Lords, I should like to congratulate them on that.<lb/>
The Royal Charter recognises the very significant role they have to play&#x2014;a role which I was glad to see the Royal Commission specially mention and identify.<lb/>
<col>392</col>
It is the role that arises from the fact that these are the professionals who are closest to the people, closest to their representatives and most capable of reflecting their chief concern.<lb/>
I was particularly glad that the noble Lord, Lord Walston, mentioned noise because that is the concern which most of the public raise most of the time with most vehemence. Of course it is necessary for us to talk in stratospheric, scientific terms about various long-term issues with which it is important for us to grapple, but it is also important to realise that what concerns most of the public most of the time is the horrible noise going on around them. I hope that that will be the topic which the Royal Commission tackles next.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ashby, rightly started off with extracts from what the Royal Commission had to say about the record. It was good that not only he but my noble friend Lord Nugent had something to say about the very positive role which the regional water authorities had been playing and which has led to so many of our rivers being cleaned up so well. I heard a sad story recently about salmon in the Thames. A Pakistani angler, living near Wallingford and who presumably does not read the English press all that closely, did not realise that there was a substantial reward for those people who manage to get salmon out of the Thames. Instead of taking the salmon away to claim his reward he took it home and ate it for supper. The rivers, therefore, are cleaner.<lb/>
Undoubtedly the air in our great cities is cleaner and the local authorities can take some credit for that with their enforcement of the clean air Acts of the late 1950s. It is sad and I think significant that the Royal Commission finds it necessary to say at paragraph 2 that the one area in which the progress has been negative is agriculture. The four cases mentioned are the serious damage which nitrates are threatening to do to the ground waters; the serious damage which they and fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides are doing not only to the rivers but in the air, which my noble friend Lord Craigton mentioned; and most dramatic of all, of course, the effects of straw burning. I cannot share with the noble Lord, Lord Walston, his hope that there will be an extension of the five-year period. I think farmers are jolly lucky to have the five years they look like being granted.<lb/>
I have to agree with the Royal Commission that on a number of matters which it has identified&#x2014;the one I have just mentioned is among them&#x2014;a certain dilatoriness has grown up in Whitehall and it is sad to say that the chief weakness resides in my old department, the Department of the Environment. There is now a singular lack of leadership where previously there was a fairly strong and powerful driving force. The slow, partial, halting, hesitant progress in introducing Part II of the Control of Pollution Act is the worst example of that. It is absolutely essential, and the Royal Commission rightly makes the point very strongly, that a coherent and dynamic lead is introduced in Whitehall. This all arises from the drive to achieve staff economies and economies of all kinds in the Civil Service. I welcome that, but it can be taken too far and it has been taken to the point where this lack of leadership and coordination in Whitehall is putting United Kingdom industry at a competitive disadvantage. Surely that is
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0205"/>
<col>393</col>
the last thing which Government policies should be doing now.<lb/>
I welcome the emphasis from the Royal Commission in what it says about the benefits of an open, preventive, anticipatory approach to pollution control and a forcing pace; a pace which, if it is set out deliberately, will force damaging industries&#x2014;agriculture is the one mentioned, but there are others&#x2014;to take the steps to introduce the technology necessary to meet legislation which is to be introduced at certain set periods. It is absurd that in 1984 the environmental health officers are still having to rely on the 1936 legislation, under which they have to prove that a statutory nuisance has been caused before they can take enforcement action in a whole number of fields. Surely we should have moved on from that by now.<lb/>
My concern is not only with the fact that it has taken 10 years to introduce Part II of the Control of Pollution Act but with the fact that nobody knew when various parts of it were to be introduced. There was no programme, and that made it impossible for the industries concerned to phase their capital investments, and so on, to meet legislation. Pollution control certainly imposes costs on industry, as the CBI has long been saying, if it is introduced on the wrong lines, late and in a panic. That is what is happening now in response to public anxiety about acid deposition. However, if pollution control is brought in on the right lines, after proper research and deliberate legislation, steadily, coherently and in good time, it not only saves industries money but puts them in a strong competitive position with their international competitors. That is why it is so important not to be cheeseparing as regards the staffs allocated to this work in Whitehall.<lb/>
I should like to end on the various things that the Royal Commission has to say&#x2014;all very welcome to me&#x2014;on the fuller role of the Royal Institution of Environmental Health Officers. It has already taken the very sensible step of inviting the president of the institute on to the Royal Commission itself. I am sure that he has proved to be useful there. The Royal Commission rightly recommends that there should now be an environmental health officers' unit within the Department of the Environment. That will do a great deal to help the department to regain the ground it has lost. It identifies a multiple and growing role for the environmental health officers in local authorities, and that is welcome, too. Firstly, it recommends that they should act as agents and also as partners with the IAPI. That cannot but be right. There are a whole lot of processes which were once under the clean air and alkali inspectorate which now certainly ought to be under the environmental health officers in local government.<lb/>
The commission recommends that the environmental health officers and their authorities should be the designators and monitors of our bathing beaches. How much I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, that our present position on that makes us ludicrous in the eyes of the EC. It also recommends, and I agree, that the environmental health officers should be the controllers and the monitors of emissions from vehicles. It is quite right that they, too, should be the enforcers of higher standards in that
<col>394</col>
respect&#x2014;something very perceptible to the public&#x2014;as they are on any other standards.<lb/>
I very much welcome the debate and particularly the reports around which it has taken place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01799">6.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01800"><member>Baroness Robson of Kiddington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was tremendously impressed listening to the debate in which so many people with outstanding scientific knowledge took part. When the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, opened the debate&#x2014;and we are very grateful to him and to the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, for giving us the opportunity to debate these two important reports&#x2014;he said that 10 years ago the Control of Pollution Act was greeted as a charter for the future. He was obviously disappointed in what had happened over those 10 years. He said that what have spurred action at the moment largely have been public opinion and the European Community involvement. I am not a scientist. I represent public opinion, or at least that is what I like to think.<lb/>
When the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, made his speech he referred to the problem that managers who are looking after the public good have when they come up against a demand by the public and incomplete scientific proof that a particular pollutant is dangerous or should be controlled. He referred to Chapter VI, paragraph 6.30 in the Royal Commission report. I think that this is one of the problems in the present context: there may not be sufficient scientific proof available; however, public opinion, not only in this country but in all countries in Europe, demands that something should be done. That is so over the question of acid rain, which has been referred to this afternoon by a large number of speakers.<lb/>
It is obvious that we must welcome the CEGB's commitment that if its present research project (which is largely being funded by the Government) comes up with evidence which justifies certain actions, those actions will be taken. However, I think that the general public and many people with great scientific knowledge would say that, on the basis of evidence that already exists about emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and hydrocarbons, the case is clear that we should take action now. Other European governments, like those of West Germany, Sweden, Norway, Holland and France agree that action should be taken.<lb/>
It is equally obvious, even to a member of the public, that power stations and their emissions are not the only culprits; but they are one of the culprits, and a substantial one. As we have been told this afternoon, it is possible with modern technology to reduce those emissions. We have also been told about the enormous cost in which that would involve the country. But we have responsibilities not only to ourselves but to the other countries in Europe.<lb/>
We have managed to reduce emissions in this country by 37 per cent. since 1970, but we are still one of the largest emitters of SO<sub>2</sub> in Europe. I think that ourselves and Germany are the greatest offenders. One could say that, because we have managed to protect ourselves to a certain point, we feel satisfied. But we live in the European Community and we have responsibilities to other countries in Europe. We also have responsibilities to future generations.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0206"/>
<col>395</col>
According to the Select Committee report, if we were to equip two power stations with flue gas desulphurization&#x2014;and that is a recommendation which I sincerely hope the Government will accept&#x2014;we would achieve a 30 per cent. reduction in emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> by the year 2000. I believe that we must do that at the same time as concentrating on further development of pressurized fluid bed combustors as another matter of urgency. A large sum of money must be put aside for that research.<lb/>
We have been told by the Select Committee that there is not really a sign of acid rain being a great problem in the British Isles. The Royal Commission does not quite agree with that statement. According to the Royal Commission, parts of Scotland and the North of England are beginning to see damage. It is not so much damage to trees as to lakes and watercourses. One cannot help wondering whether the damage in Scotland is not more obvious than in England because the land and its structure there is very similar to that of Scandinavia&#x2014;soil on top of granite rock. That means that the water does not have a chance to be neutralised, as it has in England where there is a limestone base.<lb/>
The other factors that perhaps make it dangerous for a country like Scotland, and certainly has an impact in the Scandinavian countries, are the higher amount of rainfall and the fact that a lot of the rain falls as snow, which rests on top of trees and slowly melts. Therefore a much greater amount of acidity penetrates. Those are factors which I believe we must consider. I should be deeply upset if the Government were not prepared at least to implement the recommendations of the Select Committee on the cleaning of emissions from power stations.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Ashby mentioned the question of unnecessary secrecy. Speaking as a member of the public, I have very strong feelings about that. The information available to the public relating to new pesticides, chemicals and radioactive waste is shrouded in too much secrecy. The noble Lord, Lord Flowers, talked glowingly about the cleaner emissions from nuclear power stations, but he did not say very much about the problem of nuclear waste. The secrecy gives rise to fear and suspicion in the minds of the public. Once that fear and suspicion are there, they are almost impossible to eradicate. Information that may subsequently be disclosed as a result of public pressure is often viewed with the same suspicion and mistrust as the original information.<lb/>
Ministers and controlling authorities with power to withhold information should do so only on the grounds of national security. Perhaps the best way would be to implement the Royal Commission's recommendation No. 7.30, to include independent members on the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive, who would represent public concern and environmental expertise. Among those independent members I should like to see a representative from either Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01801">In 1970, at the time of the Stockholm Conference, Britain was a leader in matters of environmental control. Today, whatever we in this country may say and whatever we may feel we are not looked on as leaders in this field in Europe. I think that this is a
<col>396</col>
tragedy. I sincerely hope that the Government will take seriously the last paragraph of the report of the Royal Commission:
<quote>"Control of environmental pollution is not an optional extra; it is a fundamental component of national economic and social policy, and has many international implications. Pollution control policy, and environmental policy generally, should be accorded the priority and resources adequate for their integration in the national decisionmaking process so that their potential benefits can be realised to the full and at least cost".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01802">6.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01803"><member>Baroness Nicol</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this must be one of the most important debates that we have had in this Session, touching as it does every aspect of human activity.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Ashby, mentioned at the beginning of his speech the work of the two bodies and the amount of effort put into it by members of both committees and their staff. When you add to that the time and effort of all those who gave evidence, the sum of human endeavour involved in these two reports is very high.<lb/>
It is unthinkable that their conclusions and recommendations should not be followed up, even if not all can be acted upon as quickly as we should wish. There has been a high level of agreement this afternoon. That is surprising when one considers the different experiences of those who have spoken. I should particularly like to support the noble Lord, Lord Sandford, and others in their support for the environmental officers of district councils and in particular the work that they do in relation to noise. Noise is one of the worst environmental pollutants which we have to suffer at the moment. There are very few of us in this House who have not been affected by it and who do not react to it.<lb/>
The single note of disagreement which I have had is with the noble Lord, Lord Walston, on the question of straw burning. In fact there has been a good deal of complaint about this in my area of the country. I am sorry to say that even with the NFU's new rules or code of conduct there has been a lot of pollution again this year. At times we were sadly reminded of the worst of last year. So I feel that there is still a long way to go in that field&#x2014;if your Lordships will forgive the pun!<lb/>
I want to concentrate particularly on air pollution. The five Commission documents considered in the Select Committee's report are welcomed, in that they are pressing action upon member states. As has been said, the United Kingdom, regrettably, needs to be pressed. We are not a good neighbour in pollution terms.<lb/>
A year which has seen publication of the two reports that we are discussing, and also the report on acid rain of the Select Committee in another place must surely see some movement by Her Majesty's Government to redeem our reputation. But whether or not the Commission requires it, it has been stressed by both the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, and the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, that action is necessary now to safeguard our own future. The arrival of the final proof will be too late.<lb/>
New technology is much more likely to develop with the impetus of legislation, as we have proved so many
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0207"/>
<col>397</col>
times in other fields. Air pollution has been a subject of concern in this country since the Industrial Revolution. The effects of acid deposition have been known to us since the 1860s and our high stack policy was developed in good faith to prevent local damage and in the belief that gases would disperse in the atmosphere without harm. But within a decade damage to fish life and forests in Scandinavia became evident and was linked with distant industrial emissions, mostly of SO<sub>2</sub>.<lb/>
As damage has increased and become more widespread, research has indicated that pollutants other than SO<sub>2</sub> are involved in the problem. These include NOx and 0<sub>3</sub> (that is, ozone, one of the worst emissions from moving vehicles). These emissions are increasing, whereas emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> have been stabilised.<lb/>
Acid rain has caught the public's imagination. There is something particularly unpleasant in what was always looked upon as "the gentle rain from heaven" and which was entirely beneficial suddenly becoming an enemy which destroys life on earth. However, we must not allow the fact that the media have caught on to the term "acid rain"&#x2014;and it has caught the public's imagination&#x2014;to divert us from the need to examine properly its causes. It is evident that we are still uncertain of its exact causes. What is true is that whatever emissions are allowed to go up are reacting together in a poisonous cocktail and inevitably coming down again, to our detriment.<lb/>
It therefore follows that we must take action to control all harmful emissions, whilst continuing research into their final effects. The noble Lord, Lord Ironside, mentioned the bubble solution. However, I think that unless this is very carefully controlled it might not be the answer. There will have to be, somewhere, some control. I do not think that we can allow smaller plants to horse-trade among themselves about which will be the polluter. Government control is needed from the centre. The cost of the research must also be borne by central funds rather than by local authorities.<lb/>
The large plant directive is important; but within the United Kingdom the large plant defined would apply solely to the CEGB power stations. There is a danger that these easily identified offenders, who are subject to Government control, may become symbolic targets and divert public attention and pressure from sources of other pollutants. The question has been discussed of the possibility of introducing FGD into two of the power stations before the 1990s. However, as has been pointed out, I think by the noble Lord, Lord Flowers, FGD itself produces a pollution which has to be dealt with.<lb/>
There is also the environmental objection to the large-scale removal of limestone pavements, which has been fought against in many areas of the country in the past. That, too, is destructive. It does seem that we should not lightly undertake this particular "improvement"&#x2014;and that word is in quotation marks.<lb/>
The cumulative effect of other smaller units could be more deadly than the already diminishing emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> from the CEGB plants. The
<col>398</col>
committee makes this point, as the noble Lord, Lord Nugent, explained. The committee's recommendations on this are sensible and should be acted upon, but with the exception that we should look at the alternative method of scrubbing FBC rather than FGD.<lb/>
Vehicle pollution is increasing. The reduction of lead in petrol will be welcomed, but emissions of other toxic gases must be controlled, notably NO<sub>x</sub>. We need the stick of legislation and the carrot of financial reward. Lean-burn engines and stop-start motoring are available in other countries, and even here in imported cars. Why not have a reduced road fund licence for such improvements as an incentive to motorists to buy them and to our manufacturers to make them?<lb/>
The costs of pollution control are measurable, and so are quoted as reasons for inaction. The costs of a polluted environment are less easy to define, though some are visible in reduced crops, damaged buildings, dead trees and lifeless lakes. But who can cost the effect on human health and quality of life, as my noble friend Lord Davies of Leek so eloquently said? We have a right to breathe clean air in a healthy environment, and a right to demand that our legislators provide it. My noble friend Lady Birk said that the finance must be forthcoming. Local authorities cannot do it; they are too restricted. I hope that we shall hear from the Minister tonight that the Government back the findings of these reports and that they are prepared to invest in following them up within a reasonable time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01804">6.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01805"><member>Lord Skelmcrsdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, and to the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, for having been able to arrange through the usual channels for the subject of pollution to be debated in your Lordships' House this evening. I say "this evening" because it is most timely, as several noble Lords have remarked, that such a debate should occur before the Government dot the i's and cross the t's on their own official response. We had originally hoped, as some of your Lordships are undoubtedly aware, to publish this by the end of the parliamentary Session. Time has, unfortunately, narrowly defeated us, but many of the points raised tonight will be included, and this evening's debate will be far from wasted. Your Lordships will understand from this that my role tonight is listening to, and learning, the House's view on this matter, and that I cannot make a major Government announcement.<lb/>
However, although I must not pre-empt the conclusions of the response, the Government's position on a number of the Royal Commission's recommendations has already been made clear. I shall have a few words to say about these shortly. It is certainly no secret that we regard the Tenth Report as an important milestone, in the spirit of the Commission's first report. It is important to keep overall policy under review, particularly in an area such as environmental protection where media interest is so often focused on specific scare stories. I congratulate the Royal Commission on producing such an informed and balanced report both on general issues, such as confidentiality and our stance in
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0208"/>
<col>399</col>
Europe, as well as on their more specific recommendations on the important subjects of water quality around our coasts and air pollution.<lb/>
I note in particular their working definition of pollution, in paragraph 1.9, which has been widely accepted internationally. If I can paraphrase this, it is that the input of contaminants into an environment is defined as pollution only where it actually causes harm. This is a definition that has worked well in solving the acute problems of the past when the causes and effects of pollution could be readily identified. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Leek, that now that most of the more acute problems have been dealt with, we are often faced with the more difficult task of assessing the long-term effects of low levels of discharges, sometimes operating over long distances and over wide areas. The noble Baroness, Lady Robson, would no doubt agree with me that public opinion does not share this widely accepted view and that before we make a great deal of progress on the environmental-pollution front we need to get a much wider consensus in these matters.<lb/>
It is extremely hard to assess exactly what is causing the problem and how it can be solved. Because of this uncertainty, cost benefit considerations inevitably come into play. Here I note the views on monitoring of my noble friend Lord Ironside. It is hard to justify spending vast sums of public money when there is no certainty of solving the problem. This is what lies at the heart of the problem of acid rain, on which I shall have more to say later, and of several other issues discussed in the Tenth Report, on which I shall speak first.<lb/>
The Government have sometimes been accused in the past of leaving Royal Commission reports on the shelf to gather dust. Not only will we be publishing our formal response very quickly this time, second in speed, I might say, only to one other, which I think was the report of lead in petrol, but in our action since the report was published in February we have already shown that our thinking is in broad accord with the Royal Commission's proposals in their Tenth Report.<lb/>
Let me offer some examples. On the question of the confidentiality of environmental matters, first raised, I think, by the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment has already said in another place that in this area, above all, there must be a presumption in favour of openness. We are working out proposals to turn this principle into practice.<lb/>
I do not think that we should be expected to be rushed on this. It is overturning a policy, as the House well knows, that has been in existence for quite a number of years&#x2014;under more than one Government I might add. I was interested to hear the comments of the noble Lords, Lord Ashby and Lord Flowers, on the Government's implementation of the BPEO concept. I note their criticisms. I believe that this is, in fact, another area where the Government's thinking is in broad accord with the Royal Commission. We fully accept that BPEO can, as the Tenth Report showed, be applied both at the local level&#x2014;how a particular factory should dispose of its wastes&#x2014;and at the national level&#x2014;whether the United Kingdom should dispose of sewage sludge at sea or bury it on land.<lb/>
<col>400</col>
I choose this example advisedly because <b>our</b> position at the North Sea conference this week will depend on our view that sea disposal can often represent the best practicable environmental option for this particular problem. But, as I said in our debate on the Royal Commission's Fifth Report in March last year, the BPEO principle has been implicit in our approach to pollution control generally for many years.<lb/>
The allied, and perhaps improved, format of this is, as has been mentioned, the best environmental timetable&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01806"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend leaves the point about the disposal of sewage sludge at sea, will he deal with the point that I mentioned about the desirability of accepting the Royal Commission's recommendation of joining in an international, independent survey of the North Sea which, as I said, the Thames Water Authority would warmly welcome because it is confident that its standards will stand up to such a survey?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01807"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I was well aware of the point that my noble friend made. But, as I said at the beginning of my speech, it is not for me this evening to put out the Government's view on any particular aspect of the report. For my own part, I can see no reason why we should not agree with the Thames Water Authority on this point.<lb/>
I was going on to talk about best environmental timetable, which is a concept welcomed by the Government. Our policy of removing lead from petrol is, I would say, an example of BET. We have announced our intention of reducing the lead content of petrol to 0.15 grammes per litre by the end of next year, which is a 60 per cent. reduction. The second and more difficult stage in our timetable requires European Community-wide action to remove added lead altogether. Our timetable here is that it should be done by 1989. However, as the House will know, there is some argument about this with our fellow members of the EEC.<lb/>
Elsewhere, we have already implemented measures along the lines of those recommended by the Royal Commission. Not only have we implemented many of the outstanding provisions of Part II of the Control of Pollution Act covering particularly the extension of control systems and the introduction of public involvement; we are pressing ahead with our major initiative to clean up the Mersey and we have made a major contribution to the International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, which the Federal German Government are holding in Bremen later this week, and which will have before it an internationally agreed assessment of the health of the North Sea following a United Kingdom initiative very much along the lines proposed by the Royal Commission.<lb/>
On the implementation of Part II of the Control of Pollution Act, I must disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, and with my noble friend Lord Sandford. I do not think that it is a case of too little, too late. What we have is a phased implementation over a period of three years which I think is a very practical solution after a very long time during which no less than four governments have grappled with the problem.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0209"/>
<col>401</col>
But rather than simply catalogue achievements, let me outline some of the principles on which all our environmental protection measures rely. First, as I have already mentioned, our decision must be based on a sound and scientific foundation whenever possible. This applies both nationally and internationally. Secondly, we must set realistic goals for environmental improvement, recognising that any industrial society must inevitably produce waste products. We must also look at the technical feasibility and costs of alternative disposal methods, weigh this against the need to enforce tighter standards, and set our priorities accordingly, bearing in mind all the time, that we have to justify our spending on the environment alongside all the other demands for expenditure that are made on government.<lb/>
Next, it is unavoidable that if we are to continue to enjoy the benefits of an industrial society we shall have wastes to dispose of, to either land or air. We need to be sure that we are disposing of these wastes in the way that does least harm to the environment. This is the "best practicable environmental option" principle advocated by the Royal Commission in this and other reports.<lb/>
This leads me on to my final principle, which is the need to recognise the international dimension to many of today's environmental problems and the need to play a positive role in finding solutions. We are keen to move forward whenever possible in accordance with our European Community partners, but we are equally prepared to participate in other fora, such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the North Sea Conference, to help achieve this important goal.<lb/>
These principles apply in the air pollution field as elsewhere, and here I turn to the Report of your Lordships' EEC Select Committee on the Environment. This is a comprehensive report on a number of complicated interlocking proposals for Community legislation. The major theme of the proposals, as the Select Committee recognise, is that of acid deposition. Widespread damage has been attributed to this. The United Kingdom Government share this concern. The news of extensive damage to forests in the Federal Republic of Germany which emerged two years ago added even more cause for concern about the problem. It is no coincidence that the measures proposed by the European Commission date from 1982.<lb/>
The problem which we now face, both in the Community and in other international fora, is what action we should take, what action will be effective, and cost-effective. One course of action which has been chosen by several countries is to commit themselves to a reduction of 30 per cent. on their total 1980 SO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 1993. The Government have given the matter a great deal of thought and have disagreed that, for us anyway, this is the desired option. After all, we know that in this country SO<sub>2</sub> emissions have fallen by nearly 40 per cent. since 1970, and that the incidence of acid rain has not fallen substantially. Indeed, I understood the noble Baroness, Lady Robson, to say that she felt it had in fact increased while the amounts of SO<sub>2</sub> have been<lb/>
<col>402</col>
decreasing. As the Royal Commission recognise in conclusion 7.83, there are still considerable uncertainties about the physical and chemical processes leading to acid deposition, which itself takes a number of forms, and other processes are at work in the atmosphere which give rise to other forms of pollution&#x2014;the so-called cocktail effect.<lb/>
Another factor to be considered is that control of industrial and vehicle source emissions might be very expensive and still might not have the desired effect. The Select Committee took evidence from the CEGB on the price of power option controls. They state that a 60 per cent. reduction in CEGB emissions alone would cost some &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 billion. On current reckoning this would eventually add some 5 per cent. to electricity bills.<lb/>
Then there is the cost of vehicle controls. Introduction of United States-type controls would cost some &#x00A3;2 billion in the United Kingdom. In this context a fixed target does not appear to us to be an appropriate response. Yet we wish to be good neighbours. We recognise the need to tackle environmental damage attributed to acid deposition. We share this objective with those countries that have already committed themselves to specific reductions in the next decade. We also think it important that the measures we take should achieve results. The public needs to be assured that the Government are spending money wisely. Scientific knowledge is developing rapidly, but it is not yet clear that expenditure now of hundreds of millions of pounds on reducing sulphur dioxide emissions would meet these criteria. We believe that the appropriate course is to build on the significant emission reduction of recent years. We are therefore aiming for further substantial reductions, not only in sulphur dioxide emissions but also in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions within a reasonable timescale&#x2014;perhaps by the end of the century.<lb/>
This is a wise precaution to be taken until such time as research provides the real answers. I would not, in the terms of the noble Lord, Lord Ashby, call this expediency. I would put it more in terms of the final paragraph of his speech, when he was talking about the prevention of time bombs. Nor should this be seen as no action, as described by the noble Lord, Lord Nathan. In the case of sulphur dioxide, we intend to do this by maintaining the 20 per cent. reduction already achieved since 1980 through energy conservation, fuel substitution and industrial restructuring. Meanwhile, work on new abatement technologies will be pressed, and pressed hard, in the case of nitrogen oxide, by the above measures, but also by the development of lean-burn technology for motor vehicles. After all, motor vehicles account for 35 per cent. of the nitrogen oxide emissions.<lb/>
We will, of course, be prepared to take further action if science indicates it is needed. In this way we believe that a balance will be struck between the need to improve the environment and the need to avoid imposing unreasonable cost burdens on industry and the public. We share fully with those countries which have committed themselves to reductions the will to reduce emissions. But in the circumstances we consider that a policy aim is the appropriate response to the problem.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0210"/>
<col>403</col>
I turn now to a few of the detailed points in the Select Committee's report. The large plants directive is clearly the major proposal, and we agree with the committee that, in preparing this draft, the Commission should have given much more consideration to the problem they wished to tackle. Obviously I cannot go too far into this as the proposal is under negotiation, but noble Lords may be assured that the Government have the Select Committee's recommendations well in mind.<lb/>
The committee also refer to the nitrogen dioxide air quality directive, which is also still under negotiation, as is the regulation on the protection of forests against fire and acid rain. Both these instruments are concerned with monitoring, and the Government accept that more monitoring, especially of oxides of nitrogen and ozone, is necessary. We have taken note of the committee's points on the documents, and will keep them in mind in negotiations on the proposal which the Commission tell us they will make on waste oil burning.<lb/>
The committee rightly stress the need to develop new and better control technologies for sulphur emissions. The Government are encouraging both the NCB and the CEGB to press on with their already extensive development programmes in this field. I can tell the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, that this would include the pressurised, fluidised bed combusters.<lb/>
Finally, I note what the committee say about the need for urgent priority to review air pollution control legislation. We, too, are anxious to get on with this, and are now preparing a consultation paper to which both the Royal Commission's Tenth Report and the Scrutiny Committee's report will provide valuable background.<lb/>
This has been a most useful debate and has covered a very wide field, straying from the application of pesticides to new methods of burning coal to generate electricity. As the noble Baroness, Lady Birk, remarked, it has been an enormous amount to chew on in one afternoon. I note especially, and will pass on, your Lordships' views on the transfer of the Industrial Air Pollution Inspectorate to the Department of the Environment from the Health and Safety Inspectorate, not forgetting the points made by my noble friend Lord Cranbrook, which are new to me.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Craigton referred to the much-heralded pesticide Bill. I must say that his X-ray eyes have rather zeroed in on a proposed piece of legislation which I, for one, have not seen, but I am assured that different spraying techniques are appropriate for different conditions. However, I should not pre-empt the Queen's Speech nor the publication of the Bill, except to say that we believe the Bill will provide all the necessary powers for Ministers to ensure that efficient and safe techniques are available to users, while preventing the use of those which are not. Of course, we shall welcome the comments of my noble friend and those of your Lordships when the Bill eventually comes before your Lordships.<lb/>
I can assure the House that none of this very broadly based debate is lost on the Government, and that your Lordships can expect the Government's response to the Royal Commission in weeks rather than months.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Western European Union: Re-activation</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01817">6.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01818"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are confident that the proposed "re-activation" of the Western European Union can be satisfactorily accomplished without effectively impinging on the activities of the "Eurogroup" in Brussels and the Independent European Programme Group in Rome.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01819">The noble Lord said: My Lords, I put down this Question after reading a well-drafted paper called <i>Reactivation of the Western European Union</i>, apparently prepared by a working group instructed by the Western European Union Council and the political directors of the various foreign ministries. The paper sets forth clearly&#x2014;and, subject to certain ambiguities, to my mind convincingly&#x2014;the case for now initiating a vigorous reorganisation of European defence within the general framework of the North Atlantic Treaty on the basis of an organisation which is now unfortunately in many respects defunct.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01820">At the time I tabled the Question I did not appreciate that a debate here today would follow immediately upon a meeting in Rome of the seven foreign and defence Ministers concerned and actually coincide with a meeting of the WEU Assembly in that same place. But no matter, for at least the Government will now, I hope, be able to tell us what
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0211"/>
<col>405</col>
actually happened at the meeting of Ministers over and above what we have read in the press both yesterday and today, which merely says that the Ministers will meet periodically for the purpose of exchanging views on what suitable co-operation might be possible in the future. I believe that that is all that was effectively said.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01821">After all, the fundamental reason for doing something of this sort is now increasingly accepted by great experts on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, I need only mention as leaders of this school of thought Henry Kissinger and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Carver, to say nothing of the SACEUR, General Rogers. For whether or not we believe in the sheer impossibility of ever having first recourse, in any circumstances whatever, to nuclear weapons, there is obviously everything to be said for strengthening the so-called conventional, or non-nuclear, defence of Western Europe, if only for the purpose of "raising the nuclear threshold", as the phrase goes, and thus decreasing the possibility not only of nuclear but also of any armed conflict between the two great opposing blocs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01822">I wonder whether this object can best be achieved by means of the so-called ET, or "emerging technology", whereby, as I understand it, all moving objects could apparently be accounted for on the other side of the line by non-nuclear means&#x2014;a project which would certainly be very expensive and take many years to complete. Alternatively, I wonder whether it is necessary to adopt the formulae of the "air-battle", or long distance penetration of the enemy lines, favoured it seems by the Americans but rejected by the Germans and, as I should hope, also by Her Majesty's Government, for it contemplates the immediate use of chemical and nuclear weapons behind the enemy lines which less extreme proposals for forward action do not. What is certain is that there are things which could be done and should be done in the near future to establish at least the foundation of any credible non-nuclear defensive scheme.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01823">I need hardly elaborate on what those are because for many years now they have been rehearsed in the media, but they would include of course the production in common of the latest "smart" bombs, as they are called, and electronic devices; anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons of various kinds; adequate protection of airfields and communication centres; dispersal of dumps; the creation of small forward-based so-called "Jaeger" groups with "prepositioned arms"; greater facilities for reinforcements; the interoperability of munitions and spare parts; and, generally speaking, all means capable&#x2014;given a minimum of goodwill and co-operation&#x2014;of establishing a credible conventional defensive system.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01824">The purpose of course would be to hold up the adversary for more than the few days to which, it would appear, in default of adequate supplies and reinforcements, it would as things are and failing a suicidal recourse to nuclear weapons, be more or less restricted. I need hardly say that some of these things are a NATO responsibility; but others could and should be more suitably left to the European members of the alliance. That is a thesis which is generally held by great experts on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<col>406</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01825">That all this would cost rather more than the "Europeans" now spend on defence is certain; that it would not mean an increase of more than say, 2 per cent. is probable; and if we should choose to abandon the attempt to build a useless and so-called independent nuclear strategic deterrent of our own of the magnitude of Trident&#x2014;I repeat, of the magnitude of Trident&#x2014;then, so far as we are concerned, the expense would be very much less. In any case if we need a workable deterrent&#x2014;and of course we do&#x2014;then that obviously is it.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01826">Granted therefore that this is our objective&#x2014;and I hope that is the Government's objective&#x2014;what is the best way of achieving it? Clearly co-operation with the Americans is essential. But there must be some method, some machinery, some structure for coordinating and regulating the individual efforts of the comparatively small&#x2014;or at least smaller&#x2014;members of the Alliance on this side of the Atlantic. This, frankly, hardly exists at the present time&#x2014;or, rather, the existing system is a muddle. There is, for instance, the so-called Eurogroup in Brussels consisting of the European members of the Alliance, with the important exception of the French. This has done a certain amount of good work, but it has little ministerial direction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01827">In addition to this there is the Independent European Programme Group which was set up in Rome at the beginning of 1976&#x2014;incidentally just after I had got the European Parliament to recommend, among other things, something of the kind&#x2014;which happily includes the French, but again, failing any real ministerial impetus, it has up to now done little or nothing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01828">Alongside this is the consistent effort of an influential group in the European Parliament's Political Committee which urges European defence co-operation under the general aegis, I suppose, of the political wing of the European Economic Community. This, as such, is obviously logical. How can you have a common foreign policy&#x2014;which we say we must have&#x2014;without any regard for defence as well? Then of course we have the dormant Western European Union&#x2014;dormant from the point of view of any real authority on the defence side, though possessing, as we know, an active and, in its way, quite influential parliamentary assembly which certainly puts forward all kinds of ideas for defence policy generally. All this is a great nonsense. As a system&#x2014;if you can call it a system&#x2014;it seems almost designed to frustrate any real attempt to get a European defence policy going at all.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01829">I must confess that up until now, or recently&#x2014;as the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, who happily is going to speak in this debate, will remember&#x2014;I have been an advocate of the establishment of some new machine which will provide for periodic meetings of the EEC defence ministers, or the defence ministers of members of the EEC&#x2014;or such of them as were prepared to come together&#x2014;an important provision&#x2014;to supervise all these activities and give definite instructions to a body of officials meeting preferably, but not necessarily, in Brussels, which would take the place of the Eurogroup and the IEPG and work in harmony with the relevant committee of the European Parliament.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0212"/>
<col>407</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01830">This would be perfectly possible legally since the political wing of the EEC is not subject to the Treaty of Rome, and the Ministers in any such grouping could take decisions in any way that seemed good to them. If any members of the EEC Council&#x2014;presumably those from Denmark and Ireland, which is, after all, neutral&#x2014;did not wish to join in, that would be quite understandable. They would naturally not be bound by an decisions that might be taken. But there is no reason why those countries should have a veto on its functions or composition. And to hold up all real European co-operation in defence in order, as I understand it, to preserve the principle of consensus is surely the height of folly, and quite unnecessary too. If the Spaniards and the Portuguese, once they become members of the EEC, wanted to join they would presumably be very welcome. I have never understood why Her Majesty's Government have declined to consider this simple solution of the main difficulty on what appears, on the face of it, to be simply ideological grounds.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01831">If however for any reason such a solution is unacceptable from the political point of view&#x2014;and I cannot understand why it should be&#x2014;then there is certainly a case for "reactivating", as they say, WEU on the lines proposed by the working group of the WEU Council to which I drew attention at the beginning of my remarks. One reason for doing this&#x2014;the important reason, of course&#x2014;is that the enlarged Brussels treaty, which binds the Seven, is far more operative than the North Atlantic Treaty in that it commits each signatory to go to the assistance of any other which is the victim of aggression with all the means at its disposal from the moment when the aggression takes place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01832">The only real political weakness in the paper to which I have referred, as I see it, is that while laying down very properly that
<quote>"an urgent topic [for consideration by WEU] is the growing threat to Europe in the various guises, i.e., military, political and psychological"</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01833">which should
<quote>"unquestionably be discussed within the Seven",</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01834">it goes on to say that such discussions should be undertaken
<quote>"without duplicating work in studies carried on elsewhere"</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01835">and that, more especially, there should be no encroachment
<quote>"on bodies such as the IEPG and the Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD)"</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01836">which, as we have noted, failing any real ministerial impetus up to now, have contributed hardly anything so far to the achievement of the much-needed common European conventional defence policy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01837">However, if nevertheless the WEU is selected as the institution for achieving all this&#x2014;I hope it will be in the circumstances&#x2014;then obviously it must encroach on the activities, such as they are, of the bodies mentioned. If it does not, it will just be no good at all; merely a wheel going round all by itself not geared up to anything. The Ministers will meet, but nothing will happen.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01838">Assuming then that a reactivated WEU system is really going to function properly, it must surely be
<col>408</col>
obvious that the work should be done by the Seven ministers with a suitable body at their disposal, and that the IEPG, and indeed the Eurogroup, even if they continued to exist, would have only a minor&#x2014;even a purely advisory&#x2014;role to play. Apart from the political difficulties in the way of such a solution&#x2014;recognised, it must be said by the working party&#x2014;the main theoretical disadvantage to any reactivation, as it is called, of WEU is that it would presumably sever, or cause to be severed, all connection between the political side of the European Economic Community and defence, and hence tend to concentrate efforts to create some kind of European political union in a body bearing no relation to the Brussels machinery and indeed, as I understand it, probably situated in Paris.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01839">For this reason alone I imagine that it is unlikely to appeal to at least some members of the EEC, although I believe that the Germans, foiled in a sensible attempt to go ahead with defence under the aegis of the EEC without the consent of the Irish and the Danes, are now more or less favouring some kind of WEU solution. Naturally if the French were to agree to the whole outfit, including the London office, being transported to Brussels some kind of fusion of the two organisations might be possible. But however desirable, this seems pretty unlikely at the present time.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01840">In such, as I think, distressing circumstances, I was slightly heartened to read an article by Mr Jan van Howelging, State Secretary at the Netherlands Ministry of Defence, entitled <i>The Independent European Programme Group, The Way Ahead</i> appearing in the current number of the <i>NA TO Review</i>. While freely admitting that the group, founded as long ago, as I recall, as January 1976, has done hardly anything of a practical nature so far, the author talks of a "new and favourable mood", manifested in a resolution of last April,
<quote>"to widen the search for long term collaborative opportunties <i>inter alia</i>, of a more effective and common use of IEPG equipment replacement schedules"&#x2014;</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01841">whatever that may mean&#x2014;
<quote>"and for a more balanced two-way street in arms trade between Europe and the United States"&#x2014;</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01842">a very good thing.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01843">It was also agreed, together with greater co-operation on research, to pursue together with the European Defence Industrial Group&#x2014;EDIG, of which I had not heard before&#x2014;the rationalisation of defence production which it describes as:
<quote>"an important step forward".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01844">All this is pretty vague, though no doubt excellent in principle. Why the IEPG only got around to it after some eight years of existence is surely a reflection on its utility up till now. Of more significance perhaps is a statement in the same article that Mr Heseltine is orgainsing next month a "full Ministerial IEPG meeting" described as:
<quote>"the first ever designed to monitor personally progress in this area".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01845">All this kind of meeting, admittedly restricted to those desirous of taking real action, is what I have been persistently urging for upwards of 17 years. I need hardly say that I am both impressed and delighted.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01846">I should, however, like to ask the Government whether this new effort to strengthen European
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0213"/>
<col>409</col>
defence will be with the full co-operation of the Danes and Norwegians, to say nothing of the Greeks? Mr. Heseltine can surely
<quote>"call spirits from the vasty deep. But will they come when he doth call to them?"</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01847">Also, will the decisions&#x2014;if any&#x2014;of this new high level meeting be taken by unanimity, or will any members who so desire be able to embark on certain projects by agreement among themselves&#x2014;those not so minded not being bound by any such decision on the part of their colleagues? And what about having an American observer at this ministerial meeting, should a development of the two-way street be on the agenda? Would not such a presence be extremely helpful?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01848">Finally, if this kind of procedure is contemplated, what a pity that the IEPG is not to be transferred holus bolus to Brussels, where it might be able to get the whole new contemplated system going in full co-operation with the European Economic Community. Indeed, if only from an industrial point of view is not such co-operation essential in the long run? I look forward with great interest to the answers which the Government&#x2014;fired it would now seem with welcome enthusiasm for European co-operation on defence matters&#x2014;will vouchsafe on all these, I hope, quite proper and pertinent questions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01849">7.15 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01850"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure the House is indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, for raising this matter tonight. As he said, by chance perhaps rather than by design, it could not have been more topical, coming as it does immediately after the ministerial meeting last week and the special meeting of the Assembly in Rome today. I do not agree with a number of the points that he has made, and I shall return to them in a moment. First, I should like to make it quite clear that while the Assembly might not have the influence and might not attract the publicity that we should like it to attract, it is by no means defunct. Only last June it had an excellent session addressed by none other than the noble Baroness the Minister who is to reply to this debate this evening.<lb/>
One needs briefly to look at history&#x2014;I shall not take too long&#x2014;to understand why we have WEU and why we are in the somewhat embarrassing situation of trying to find a useful role for it. The noble Lord must appreciate, perhaps more than most of us, since he has probably had a hand in it, that it is the easiest thing in the world to create a new organisation, but about the most difficult thing to do is to close down one that has ceased to have a useful function. It could well have been argued that when we joined the Common Market much of the <i>raison d'&#x00E9;tre</i> of the Western European Union ceased since it had had a valuable link in the gap in between, when we were the only member country outside the Common Market having contact at parliamentary and council level with the Common Market Ministers and Parliamentarians.<lb/>
The other vital point was that it was the predecessor of NATO. The original Brussels treaty, as the noble Lord has said, has a definite commitment for full assistance from one member to another in the event of aggression. Whereas personally I believe that the NATO members would respond in the same way in a crisis, the words of the North Atlantic Treaty are, to
<col>410</col>
put it mildly, a little equivocal. It is only a commitment to consider what they might do to help and is not in any way near as far-reaching as the Brussels treaty. One of the difficulties that has always been raised is that if one sought to amend the Brussels treaty, it might be difficult to get governments today to commit themselves as forthrightly as they were willing to do in the years immediately after the war. One of the great difficulties with WEU is that most of the things that ought to have been done require an amendment of the treaty.<lb/>
Secondly, the modified Brussels treaty was designed to deal with the crisis that arose after the failure of the European Defence Community so as to permit, under safeguards, the rearmament of Germany and Italy, and their reinstatement, which we all now see as a sensible and proper thing to happen in the centre of the western European community. One of the main functions of the Western European Union was to monitor the German rearmament so that it did not give rise to any of the fears that were expressed at the time. I do not think that there was any danger of Germany doing that, but now without needing to amend the treaty because it was in the protocol, all the restrictions on the size of German submarines and so on have, very properly, been abandoned. So in a sense, although it is part of the treaty, the armaments control agency of the Western European Union is virtually without a job. The standing armaments committee, though it is headed by an extremely able and active man, does not really have a job to do, and in my view the manpower of neither the council nor the Assembly would provide the think-tank which Ministers are suggesting might, or should, be available to European Ministers at the present time.<lb/>
I do not think there is any doubt that there is a very real problem in Europe. It is that in terms of both foreign affairs and defence we need to provide a European consensus, a European voice within the Alliance which will match the Americans. Our American friends say that they only wished to goodness that they knew what Europe, as Europe, wanted them to do. One of the difficulties is that if the Americans take the lead, we are upset, and if they do not, we criticise them for not doing so. This is one of the great dilemmas.<lb/>
With great respect to the noble Lord, I do not think he was quite clear about the two functions. One is to provide a consensus of policy and another need is to find some sensible way of procuring and developing equipment and armaments in Europe. They are not necessarily the same job, nor the same problem.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01851"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, how do you divide the two?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01852"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, quite simply. In fact, as the noble Lord should know&#x2014;and I was just going to make the point&#x2014;it is the Foreign Offices that think they deal with the policies, and the Ministers of Defence have to deal with the equipment. One of the weaknesses, I think, of all these arrangements is that it is the Foreign Ministers in the WEU and in NATO, and in any other body you like to think of, that are responsible and attend the meetings&#x2014;as, indeed, did (and I was very glad to see that he was there) our own Foreign Secretary in Rome last week, compiling and
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0214"/>
<col>411</col>
agreeing the document that has just been made. It is the ambassadors in London of the other member countries which, together with the senior officials of our Foreign Office, provide the council.<lb/>
Ministers of Defence, unless they are invited to speak to the Assembly, are not formally involved in the WEU at all. But the other great problem is that in devising the mechanism to control German rearmament it was thought (as an afterthought)&#x2014;they did not want to redraft the treaty; I think it was Monsieur Spaak who thought of it&#x2014;that it would be a good idea to have a Parliamentary Assembly. They thought that this would only be a casual thing to have, and that it could be one day after the meeting of the Council of Europe at Strasbourg. Indeed, the Assembly first met in Strasbourg. They said "Well, let us have the same membership as we have already to the Council of Europe"&#x2014;and that has been a crucial difficulty in the running of the Assembly, because a great number of the representatives from all the member countries are much more interested and more deeply involved (as, indeed, are members of our delegation from both Houses and from all the parties) in Council of Europe affairs. It is not easy to find people who are particularly interested in defence but who nevertheless want to do something in the Council of Europe.<lb/>
I had the privilege of being recently the President for three years, and I had a previous period as a member of the delegation at the Assembly in the late 1950s and 1960s, when I am bound to say, I think we had some influence on policy. I think that in the case of some of the reports that came out then&#x2014;and this was before the Dulles "massive retaliation" doctrine had been abandoned, although it was quite clear that it was a nonsense when the Soviet Union had nuclear capability&#x2014;we had some influence, and in those days we got some publicity in the press for our debates. Now, even good reports which emanate from the Assembly get no mention either in our press or in the press of the other member states. What I think motivates the French Government, which has taken the lead in wanting to re-activate the WEU, is that, I think they see it more in Assembly terms and think the Assembly can provide a counter to the very serious developments, not only in our countries but right through Europe&#x2014;except, ironically, France&#x2014;against defence.<lb/>
It is a little odd that the French socialist government has built more nuclear submarines and collected more nuclear weapons than its predecessors, whereas, of course, in socialist parties (and in much wider circles than the socialist parties) there has been an aversion against any nuclear activities right across the rest of Western Europe. The French are concerned, and I think that Herr Genscher is worried because his attempts with Senor Colombo, the Genscher-Colombo plan, have not come to anything in giving support to see whether the WEU can be utilised for that purpose.<lb/>
I have reservations about how much can be done for the obvious reason, first of all, that there is no full participation of all the European members of the alliance; and, secondly, because I think it is fair to say that within the EEC the political consultations have
<col>412</col>
been pretty successful. I think they have gone a long way to getting a type of European consensus on the broader political issues. I know the European Parliament want to run everything and anything, and that they want to go far beyond what is thought to be reasonable. But the Treaty of Rome does not permit any defence activity by the Community. The Community is totally ill-equipped to take any decisions about common defence production. It would be very costly to set up the apparatus; and what is forgotten is that the real problem about getting unanimity as to whether it is a gun or an aircraft, a tank or whatever, is that you cannot get the Chiefs of Staff to agree on the characteristics required, although great efforts have been made to do that.<lb/>
Furthermore, even if you can do that there are problems of finance and of the actual timetable. Some countries have even more rigid timetables than we have. The Germans, for example, want to do their replacement of tanks in two tranches; and nothing would persuade them, although all the evidence is there, that our gun is better than theirs. They must have their German tank gun; and in order to help, the Americans have adopted that. You really will not get an agreement through the EEC, and the EEC record&#x2014;one has to be blunt&#x2014;is not impressive. It is a community of basically industrial nations, and they spend at least 70 per cent. of their money on agriculture and 90 per cent. of their time. Practically every geographical expression has been used&#x2014;a mountain of butter, a lake of wine. I hate to think, if they were in arms production, whether it would be a pyramid of machine guns, or whatever, that they might produce. And I cannot think that they would dispose of them at less than cost price to the Warsaw Pact. That would not be a sensible thing to do; but that is the pattern by which they seem to get rid of their current surpluses.<lb/>
I do not see how anyone with the experience of the noble Lord can advocate putting the EEC into the business of running common defence procurement without the military staffs. I think it would be a great mistake if anything was done to weaken the NATO Alliance. In some ways, may be, the WEU could be strengthened. I think it could be an immense strength, if as has been proposed, but turned down by Ministers, there could be separate delegations to that assembly, as distinct from the Council of Europe, Also, I persuaded the assembly as long ago as 1960 to ask Ministers to invite the Scandinavian members of NATO to join the WEU. That was when they and we were outside the Community, but that was also rejected.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01853"><member>Lord Ardwick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord has not mentioned how the North Atlantic Assembly fits in. Would he like to bring that into the matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01854"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with great respect to my noble friend, I do not think the North Atlantic Assembly, which is an unofficial body, could be brought into the WEU. I think it is arguable that it would perhaps be more sense to have an advisory North Atlantic Assembly, and that that would take the place of the WEU; but that would not provide the essential parliamentary basis to achieve a European, as distinct from a total NATO, consensus. But I am not against its existence. I am not privileged to be a member of the North Atlantic Assembly, but I am
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0215"/>
<col>413</col>
sure it has a function, and no one is suggesting for a moment that it should not continue the work it does, although I do not think it gives the time to matters, in terms of detailed reports, that the Western European Union assembly members give. I was for only a short time a member of that assembly when it was known as the NATO Parliamentarians, which was some years ago.<lb/>
To get back to the main point, I cannot see how the WEU can deal with the real problem of arms and equipment. I think it is a mistake to think that you can provide sophisticated equipment on a basis of splitting up the job between four or five different countries. I think that is a very inefficient and expensive way of doing it.<lb/>
I should like to commend to those concerned that they should look again at the unfortunate European Defence Community Treaty, because it had a lot of very good things in it. One of them was that no country should be called upon to expend more than 10 per cent. of their defence budget in foreign exchange, plus or minus 10 per cent.; that there should be a system of checks and balances so that, for example, as we spend a lot of money on having forces in Germany, other people should buy defence equipment from us so that we could get back at least 90 per cent. of our expenditure. It would be much better if one could only persuade one's friends and neighbours, and also our American friends, to understand&#x2014;I do not think they do&#x2014;that not only do we want work (although that is important) but we also want to retain the design and technical capabilities in Europe.<lb/>
What in fact would be very sensible is this. If there are three or four different roles for helicopters, instead of four countries trying to make one helicopter we could divide the work up&#x2014;and that is what I was seeking to do. When I was Secretary of State for Defence I initiated meetings. There was a lot of criticism, and other countries were very jealous. The French and German Ministers and myself met twice a year from 1978 in order to try to push forward this collaboration. I hope those meetings still continue. But one cannot escape the fact that this has been the real problem in the Eurogroup. The Defence Ministers meet the day before their Defence Council meeting in NATO, and they do this with a view to trying to get some kind of consensus, but because the French are not there we really cannot get very far.<lb/>
There is no way, in my view, of getting a European defence policy, either for production or in any other way, without France. Since De Gaulle, as the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, will remember, threw NATO out of Paris, SHAPE from Fontainebleu, there have been problems because of this. They remain in the alliance, but they are totally outside military integration. My impression is that they want now to use the WEU as a means of getting much closer in terms of military integration without having to put up the NATO flag outside their defence establishments. One welcomes this, and I do not think one should discourage it. God forbid!, but if the need should arise I think that France would play its part in the alliance as well as anybody else. But for reasons of French history through a period when the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, was our representative in Paris&#x2014;and he will recall them well&#x2014;they cannot say at this moment,
<col>414</col>
"Let us forget the past; we will go back and take our full place in NATO and military integration". It was always difficult, sitting in the Defence Ministers' meeting without the French. Often we never quite knew whether the Greeks were coming; and I suspect that it may be that now the Turks do not come. But certainly the French never came; whereas, of course, in the council and among the permanent representatives there is a French presence, which is very important.<lb/>
While one hopes that something will come from this initiative in WEU, I do not think it will solve the problem, which is a very real and serious one, of finding a way to reach a European consensus in terms of policy and a much more sensible way in Europe of playing our part in providing equipment for the alliance. Above all, I hope that no one will come forward with new-fangled ideas or new-fangled bodies which will in any way weaken the structure of NATO, on which we all must depend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01855">7.34 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01856"><member>Lord Kennet</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the land of Europe is planted thick from the coast to the river with organisations. First, after the war there was Benelux, which shortly gave rise indirectly to Uniscan&#x2014;now dead, though Benelux is still alive; after which there came the Brussels treaty when we joined with the Benelux countries as a first move to common defence. This was swiftly followed by NATO, followed by the European Defence Community (still-born), followed by the Western European Union, the purpose of which, as noble Lords have reminded us, was to help Germany safely to re-join the civilised world. And before that, of course, there was the Council of Europe and, a little after that, the European Free Trade Association and the European Community itself. Within NATO, how many European organisations are there already? My noble ally Lord Gladwyn has enumerated them and I shall not do so again.<lb/>
Paradoxically, it seems to me that when we get such a great number of organisations&#x2014;some living, some dying, some dead, but the memory is still there&#x2014;it becomes no longer important to avoid creating any more. When you get beyond 15 or so, which is about where we are, why not make it 16? Air fares are cheap, at least for people on ministerial and bureaucratic salaries. Telephones get cheaper and more efficient every year; the scrambler does not work, but maybe that will be rectified in due course. Certainly, in adding a new purpose to the venerable and virtually moribund West European Union, we must raise many questions. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, has pointed out the obvious danger that it should get in the way of those three or four preceding attempts to create the European leg of NATO, functioning with greater or less efficiency.<lb/>
Obviously the WEU has a head start in our thoughts over any alternative, because the French want it. France has saddled iself with a very negative historic destiny by getting out of the all-important NATO 20 years ago, and they are members of the West European Union. It is important that there should be a functioning West European defence orgnisation containing France as a full member. Indeed, a west European defence organisation without France would be virtually pointless, not only for geographical
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0216"/>
<col>415</col>
reasons, but also for intellectual reasons. The French input to allied foreign policy and allied defence policy is so well thought out that it is long overdue that we should begin to benefit from it to the full. That is all in favour of West European Union.<lb/>
Another thing is against it, though, besides what the noble Lords, Lord Gladwyn and Lord Mulley, have been saying. It does not contain the flanks. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, touched on this point, and I want to reinforce it. To believe that if the Russians wish to attack Western Europe they will do so across the north German plain is to believe them guileless. I often wonder why anybody thinks that is on the cards. To many of us it seems obvious that they would do so by some other route, and that the most likely two other routes are the two flanks of NATO, what else? And of the two, the northern flank is much the more likely because it is so much more vulnerable to the Soviet Union since the enormous naval expansion of that country over the last 20 years.<lb/>
If we create a West Europe leg of NATO which really gets on with it and makes a European voice heard, which makes common European armaments policies possible, and which establishes a two-way traffic with the United States in arms procurement&#x2014;if we do all that and we do not have Portugal, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Greece and Turkey in it, as we want to, I suspect that we run quite a danger. It is tempting to welcome the French initiative with both hands and say: "At long last, close ally and brother, welcome home; we embrace you, and we will do it your way."<lb/>
That is easy, pleasant and efficacious so far as it goes. But there is a danger of applying the iodine where it does not hurt. It has to be put where it does hurt, and that is in dealing with the difficult countries in NATO&#x2014;Denmark, intrinsically, because of the immense strength of pacifism in that country; Greece, incidentally under the present Government, and intrinsically as long as the quarrel with Turkey lasts; and Turkey, intrinsically, because of the quarrel with Greece, and also because it is not a European country. These are the countries that are vulnerable to Soviet attack and these are the places where co-ordination is needed because it is difficult.<lb/>
I am not going to end up by saying: "Don't let us do WEU". All the arrows seem to be beginning to point in that direction. I say that if we do WEU, let us be very careful indeed not to lose the flank countries, and especially Norway, which is not even a politically difficult country; it is a politically easy and close country, but it is extremely exposed and, of course, it is the doorkeeper to our own waters, and to our own national security.<lb/>
I read yesterday in the press that our Government were thinking of developing WEU, no doubt in the ways we all think of, like an assembly, a council of ministers and so on, but also developing it as a think-tank. That is a very good idea. If there is to be a WEU think-tank, would it be possible to open it to the best minds on the relevant matters from the flank countries and from Iberia, even while not necessarily opening the parliamentary assembly to members of those countries? I hope that that, or something like it, may prove possible; and if the Government go forward in
<col>416</col>
WEU with France, although they will carry all our good wishes with them, I urge them to keep their eyes open towards the flanks.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01858"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, certainly has second sight in having tabled his Unstarred Question at a time when something quite important, was unexpectedly thrown into the general discussion. I should have thought that the Government would be very grateful to him for having this little discussion on it so soon after the WEU announcement. The Secretary of State made his statement on it only on 26th October, which is only a few days ago, and here tonight there are comments being put on the record by people who certainly ought to be listened to&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, who was one of our eminent ambassadors in a country which is vital in matters that can flow from this WEU announcement and an ex-Secretary of State for Defence who is in a better position than any of us to have some sort of views as to how well based that announcement may be. So this discussion is timely and I have no doubt that the Government will appreciate the sharing of ideas at this very early stage.<lb/>
I did not agree altogether with what I thought the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, seemed to indicate at one stage, when he wondered whether or not the Western European Union could be reactivated, because it had been allowed to fade away from its original meaning. Perhaps he did not mean that, but if he had that at the back of his mind I do not agree with him, because it is common form to reactivate something which though it did not work at the time it was first put on may, because circumstances have altered be a very good thing in those altered circumstances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01859"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not necessarily against a reactivation of the WEU. I am in favour of a reactivation of the WEU which makes it work. I am not in favour of a reactivation which implies that it will not work.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01860"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is very sound. But I thought from the way he made the statement to begin with that the noble Lord had doubts about whether or not it could be made to work as effectively as something new would. I feel there is some advantage in reactivating something that has a historical base rather than adding, as the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, said, to the many other organisations which over the years have been put into operation.<lb/>
The importance of WEU in one way is that one of the old problems was that Germany was a bit suspicious of the Western European Union because it was connected with disarming Germany and with not allowing it to get back into the defence swim. The fact that Germany is prepared, as one gathers from the Secretary of State's statement, to come back is a sign that the antipathy which it may then have had for very practical reasons is now being resolved. It gives some strength to WEU as a consequence.<lb/>
On the other side, everybody understands that the weakness of NATO is the absence of France and, as the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, seemed to indicate, France is perhaps now looking for an opportunity to
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0217"/>
<col>417</col>
get back in without, for historical reasons, having to appear to go back on something which in France was considered to be fundamental years ago. If the Western Union is the way of getting France back in, that could only be good, so this new beginning seems to be under rather good auspices. It has brought Germany back, forgetting its antipathy of years ago, and it has France moving in in a way that, to some extent, can overcome the weakness of France not being in NATO.<lb/>
I gave an indication that I would like to come in on this short debate only when I read the Unstarred Question that had been put down. Here, again, I was obviously wrong from the speeches I have heard, but it struck me from the wording of the Unstarred Question that there was some doubt as to whether one could reactivate the Western European Union as announced, without weakening the Euro group and the independent European programme group. It seemed to me that the Question was suggesting that one could not have an effective revival of the Western European Union without undermining the good that might be being done by the Euro group.<lb/>
I do not see it in that way. I do not think anybody would suggest that what is now on the move is what we would call a giant step forward. But it has all the indications of being a sensible attempt to try to find a way of overcoming the weaknesses that were explained so eloquently by the noble Lords, Lord Mulley and Lord Gladwyn. It is only a small step, but it is one that could well lead to bigger things. I do not see that there is any possibility of it undermining the effectiveness of the Euro group.<lb/>
The problem with NATO is that France is not there. France is not in the Euro group either. So you have those European countries which are part of the EEC without France&#x2014;one of the most important segments which ought to be there. The independent European Programme Group play an interesting and effective part, but because of the French situation they have to confine themselves purely to technical matters. The political side of things, which is a very important ingredient in all of this, does not come into that. So there is a situation where the French are not members of NATO, are not members of the Euro group but are members of, and make a contribution to, the Independent European Programme Group.<lb/>
So if you can find some way of, to some extent, merging the effectiveness of NATO, the Euro group and the Independent European Programme Group, you will be getting all the ingredients, with all the main participants there, including France. The Western European Union will be in a position to take on their agenda political as well as technical matters and, through those discussions, France, while not a member of NATO, will be able to make a contribution on the policy and political matters which its exclusion from NATO and the Euro group does not allow it to do.<lb/>
This little step forward of reactivating the Western European Union has the approval of America. The United States were beginning to doubt whether there was a coherent European policy over Western European defence. If this little step forward provides the message that there can be an effective European
<col>418</col>
contribution including France, on the technical side through the Independent European Programme Group together with WEU, we shall then have reached the point where that contribution will be recognised.<lb/>
I believe that we should reactive the Western European Union. It will have the advantage of proving that the Germans have forgotten their previous antipathies and that the French are prepared to play a part which they have not played for some time. This can only give confidence to the United States of America. From that point of view we ought to welcome it, though we should not expect a magic wand to solve our problems.<lb/>
The contributions made by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, and the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, dealt with outstanding and important issues that have nothing to do with this little step forward which is being made in order to try to provide a machine which will work. I believe that in this way we could co-ordinate NATO, the Euro group and the Independent European Programme Group. This would give confidence to the United States that Western Europe is speaking with one voice. I do not rule out the possibility that Greece, Spain and Portugal may not want to be included, but this co-ordination can be proved to be useful and to work. Therefore I hope that my noble friend will find useful the contributions of my eminent colleagues, with their real experience, only three to four days after the decision was taken in Rome to reactivate the Western European Union. We all hope that further steps will be taken and we wish them the best of good fortune in the aims which they have in mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01861">7.52 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01862"><member>Lord Boston of Faversham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, has performed a most useful service to the House in raising this matter. His first-hand and direct knowledge and experience of this subject makes it all the more valuable. I join my noble friend Lord Mulley, the noble Lord, Lord Kennet, and the noble Lord, Lord Harmar-Nicholls, in welcoming the introduction of this subject. Not only is it highly topical for the two reasons which have already been mentioned; namely, the meeting of the Permanent Council at the end of last week of the Western European Union, at which I was pleased to see the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, and the Secretary of State for Defence, Mr Heseltine, were present and also the meeting of the Assembly of the Western European Union which is taking place today. Both of these sessions mark the 30th anniversary of the Western European Union. It is also highly topical because it follows swiftly upon the State visit last week of President Mitterrand. It was he who took the initiative in putting forward proposals for reactivating the Western European Union. Therefore this debate is most timely.<lb/>
It is right to seek assurances that the reactivation of the Western European Union will not cause needless duplication of effort nor, still worse, conflict with the work being done by the Independent European Programme Group, of which, as has already been pointed out, France is a member, nor by the Eurogroup of NATO defence Ministers, of which France is not a member. Before coming to that point,
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0218"/>
<col>419</col>
let me say at once that the proposal to breathe new life into the Western European Union is welcome and worth pursuing. As it is the only European organisation empowered by treaty to discuss defence and security matters, as the working group which has been referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, set up to consider the proposal noted when it issued its paper in Paris on 13th June of this year, it is in some ways surprising that it was allowed to become moribund in the first place.<lb/>
I should like to add to one or two of the matters which have been referred to by noble Lords tonight, reasons why it seems worthwhile to pursue the plan to bring the Union to life. First, the simple fact of the source of the initiative is one reason in itself. If this is a way to bring France back more closely into the European fold of co-operation on defence and security, that is indeed a good reason to start with. I very much share the view that was put forward by my noble friend Lord Mulley, with all his experience as a former Secretary of State for Defence. That has been added to by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Harmar-Nicholls.<lb/>
The position of France should be made quite clear to those outside the House. Even though France has remained a member of NATO, she has not been fully involved ever since 1966 when President De Gaulle withdraw her from the organisation's integrated military structure. Therefore she is not on the Military Committee with the Allied Chiefs of Staff. It is true that there is a liaison mission from France, so there are facilities for the exchange of information and other joint activities. It is also the case that, as has been pointed out, France is a member of the Independent European Programme Group. But that is not quite the same as playing a full part in NATO itself. If therefore France is keen to become more closely involved in joint defence and security ventures through WEU, that might well be beneficial to all those concerned.<lb/>
Again, as the working group pointed out, it is important that public opinion should be involved in the debate about defence and security. That could be promoted through the organs of the Western European Union. I very much take the point made by my noble friend Lord Mulley about the dearth of coverage. If however the coverage provided in June when those meetings took place and the coverage provided over the past couple of days of the meeting last week of the Permanent Council are indications of a renewal of interest by the media in these matters, that might well be forthcoming.<lb/>
Another particularly valuable benefit could arise out of the scope for improving arms co-operation, especially, as the working group's paper suggests, over the use of new technologies to strengthen conventional defence. Indeed, these matters could lead to greater co-ordination of military research and procurement programmes between the main European NATO countries, so avoiding wasteful duplication in Europe and encouraging the United States to buy more weapons from European NATO countries, thus helping to satisfy European desires, which are clearly there, for much more of, as it has been put, a two-way street in terms of arms purchases as between Europe and the United States. In that way we could restore the
<col>420</col>
balance which is at present considered to be heavily in favour of the United States. If those aims were facilitated, partly by re-activating the Western European Union, it could be highly beneficial.<lb/>
It is essential to emphasise that this should be done without duplicating the efforts of bodies like the Independent European Programme Group or the Conference of National Armaments Directors, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, or the Eurogroup of NATO. Therefore the role of the Western European Union needs to be complementary to that of those other organs. I believe that it could act in that way, and in a way which strengthened the Alliance and which was acceptable to our United States allies.<lb/>
Certainly, integrated arms production and common procurement policies in Europe are desirable aims, though it is recognised that WEU's role would be limited, especially if unnecessary duplication of the rules of the other bodies I have mentioned is to be avoided. I very much take the point made by my noble friend Lord Mulley about the great difficulties involved in getting co-operation on matters of equipment and procurement generally. But perhaps if this step can be made, and there is a step in that direction, it could be helpful.<lb/>
I should like to ask the Minister whether she is able to indicate the attitude of the United States towards these reactivation proposals. It was reported in, for example, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 13th June, in quoting the French Foreign Minister, M. Cheysson, that the Americans had "no anxieties about the move" to reactivate WEU. I wonder whether the Minister can say whether that is her understanding, too.<lb/>
It would also be beneficial to renew the organisation if this led to closer and more effective European co-operation on arms control and disarmament, as has been suggested. I wonder whether the noble Baroness, Lady Young, can confirm also that those NATO members who are not in WEU are being kept fully informed about progress on these matters, in accordance with the agreement of WEU Foreign Ministers in Paris on 12th June of this year, and whether any anxieties have emerged. Perhaps the Minister might also be able to say something about the possibility that Portugal and Spain may join the organisation. I understand the position is that Portugal has applied and that Spain has expressed interest.<lb/>
Can the Minister say whether any steps at present contemplated to be taken within the WEU as a result of its reactivation are likely to require any variation of the terms of the Brussels Treaty; or are they likely to fall within the present competence of the organisation? I take it that no variation will be needed, but as the matter has been raised elsewhere, it would be useful to have the Government's definitive view on this matter.<lb/>
As to the actual Question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, I hope and expect appropriate assurances can be given that no real problems, at least of principle, need arise if the reactivation takes place effectively. We know that the first step has been taken over the past few days towards that. I look forward to hearing what the noble Baroness the Minister has to say. As we know, she already has direct experience of these matters and direct involvement in them. For
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0219"/>
<col>421</col>
example, she addressed the WEU Assembly in Paris on 19th June. Perhaps I may conclude by welcoming back the Minister after her recent extensive travels over the past few weeks on behalf of the United Kingdom. We trust that her visits abroad were not only fruitful, but also enjoyable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01863">8.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01864"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Question put down by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, is a particularly apposite one and we are all grateful to him for asking it. Indeed, we are grateful for all the contributions which have been made in this short debate this evening. The debate comes only two days after the meeting in Rome attended by my right honourable and learned friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence. That meeting marked the thirtieth anniversary of the modified Brussels treaty on which Western European Union is based. The declaration issued at that meeting by all participants&#x2014;a copy of which I have placed in the Library of the House&#x2014;expressed the determination of the seven member countries to use WEU more in future to improve defence co-operation in Europe.<lb/>
This is an important aim, and Western European Union has a real contribution to make to its achievement. Her Majesty's Government have given active and positive support to the process of reactivation of Western European Union&#x2014;which took a long step forward in Rome&#x2014;precisely because we believe that WEU has a vital and worthwhile role to play. Such a reactivation does not change two essential realities: our national defence can be assured only through NATO, and European co-operation in defence equipment is best pursued through Eurogroup and the IEPG.<lb/>
The Ministers in Rome also agreed the second document, which describes how the institutions of WEU will be reformed in order to make the best use of this forum. This, too, I am placing in the Library of the House. It describes how in future the council of WEU will meet twice a year, with the participation of both Foreign and Defence Ministers. Another important feature is that suggestions are made for improving co-operation between the council and the WEU Assembly. Furthermore, the WEU secretariat has been instructed to submit proposals by the next ministerial meeting for its own reform as well as that of its two main subsidiary organs&#x2014;the Standing Armaments Committee and the Armaments Control Agency. Such reform is the more necessary since Ministers have decided to abolish the obsolete controls on conventional weapons stocks administered by the Armaments Control Agency. Her Majesty's Government welcome this decision. None of these measures will require any amendment to the modified Brussels treaty of 1954 on which Western European Union is based. I hope that answers the point of the noble Lord, Lord Boston.<lb/>
Our objective in supporting the rebirth of WEU is to strengthen and explain the European pillar of the alliance and to improve European defence co-operation. The need for this has become clearer over the past year. It was brought into focus by the Nunn
<col>422</col>
Amendment in the United States which proposed that 30,000 American troops should be withdrawn from Europe each year between 1987 and 1989 unless in the preceding year the European allies increased defence spending by 3 per cent. or significantly improved their conventional defence capability. Happily, the amendment was defeated; but the problems which underlie it are not going to go away. We can expect further pressure from both Congress and the Administration for the European allies to increase their contribution to NATO.<lb/>
In responding we must start by giving full weight to what we already do&#x2014;and much of this is not well understood in the United States. Your Lordships will be familiar with the figures. The European allies maintain 3 million men and women on active duty as against 2 million by the United States. With reserves, the figures are 6 million and 3 million respectively. Of the Alliance's ready forces in Europe, the European allies contribute 90 per cent. of the ground forces, 80 per cent. of the combat aircraft, 80 per cent. of tanks, and 70 per cent. of fighting ships in European waters and in the eastern Atlantic. We must never tire of repeating these facts. But we must also react to legitimate concerns by getting better value for our defence spending and making genuine improvements in our forces and equipment.<lb/>
The figures I have given testify to the impressive European contribution to conventional defence in the alliance. We support its efforts to improve the combat capability of the alliance's conventional forces. But the objective must be to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the strategy of flexible response&#x2014;not to create a substitute for nuclear weapons.<lb/>
If we wish to preserve the vital American strategic commitment to Europe on which our security rests, and if we wish to ensure that our views continue to be given full weight by future American Administrations, we (the European allies) must find the answers to some difficult questions. How should we respond to the renewed and insistent public questioning of defence policies? How should we respond to the need to develop new technologies, to improve our conventional defence, at a time of rising costs? Are we able to take on a larger share of the responsibility for our common defence in Europe? What role should we play in defending Western security interests in the wider world? It is evident that these problems are common to us and our European allies and should be discussed in depth with them.<lb/>
This is where Western European Union comes in; and I was interested to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, had to say about the history of this and the reporting of the WEU. The common planning of our defence by us&#x2014;the Europeans&#x2014;together with our North American allies takes place, and must continue to do so, in NATO itself. There is no question of duplicating or undermining NATO's role. Indeed there are organs closely associated with NATO&#x2014;the Euro group, the Independent European Programme Group&#x2014;which already allow the Europeans to discuss their special problems together and undertake joint initiatives. But that does not remove the need for a deeper debate on politico-military issues. It cannot take place to the extent we would wish in European political co-operation (which includes Ireland, as a
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0220"/>
<col>423</col>
neutral country), or m the Euro group, from which one of the key allies, France, is absent. Western European Union however gathers together the seven Allies at the heart of Europe&#x2014;France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Italy and the United Kingdom&#x2014;in a forum well designed for this debate. The more successful the use of this forum, the better able WEU members will be to contribute to NATO and the Ten. In other words, WEU has a function to act as a ginger group.<lb/>
Of course, WEU's functions must be carefully defined; a point made, I think by the noble Lord, Lord Boston. In embarking on the process of reactivation of WEU, Her Majesty's Government have taken great care from the outset to ensure that neither we nor our allies should fall into the traps at which Lord Gladwyn's question hints. We have insisted all along that though better use should be made of the WEU institutions, this should be without any encroachment on the functions of NATO. We have been particularly strict about not undermining the activities of the Independent European Programme Group or of the Euro group. We have succeeded in maintaining all these principles and our WEU allies are in agreement, as the Rome Declaration and its accompanying document show. Let me say a word about each of the three bodies in question.<lb/>
First, NATO. NATO remains the foundation of our security, the treaty organisation responsible for defence, with appropriate military staff and forces. WEU can play none of these roles and does not wish to. Indeed, it is expressly stated in the Brussels Treaty that WEU will not have such functions, and that it should work in close co-operation with NATO. What it can do&#x2014;promote deeper consultation among Ministers on politico-security issues&#x2014;is complementary to NATO, and open to NATO. We have insisted that there should be the maximum transparency about what goes on in WEU. It is for the presidency to keep our other Allies fully informed. The Germans, who are now in the chair, were explicitly mandated at Paris to carry out this task. The point has been reinforced at Rome. The declaration issued on 27th October stresses the necessity of the closest possible concertation with our allies who are not members of WEU.<lb/>
Secondly, the Eurogroup. The Eurogroup, of which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence is chairman this year, is an informal grouping within NATO which brings together the Defence Ministers of the United Kingdom and the continental European members of the Alliance, apart from France. It is the ideal forum for ensuring that European contribution to the common defence is as strong and effective as possible. Its sub-groups, dealing with such practical matters as logistics, communications and training, do much valuable work. Its briefings, publications and tours by Eurogroup experts have also played an important part in explaining, particularly to North American audiences, the full extent of the European defence effort within NATO. The Nunn Amendment and the congressional pressure which I mentioned earlier underline the crucial importance of this work.<lb/>
Thirdly, the Independent European Programme Group. This body specialises in equipment matters
<col>424</col>
and has largely taken over the work of the Eurogroup in this field. It has the advantage of including France among its members. It promotes collaboration within Europe and seeks to foster a more balanced co-operation with the United States in the two-way street across the Atlantic.<lb/>
Incidentally, I should explain that it is a political body. It meets regularly at Minister of State level. Some significant new initiatives have been taken this year in the IEPG. A meeting of Ministers of State at The Hague at the beginning of April called for the search for long-term collaboration opportunities to be intensified. At the meeting of Eurogroup Ministers on 12th May my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Defence called for statements of intent to be translated into real, time-bound programmes. At his initiative, the IEPG will meet at full ministerial level in The Hague next month. The noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn asked some questions about this matter. In particular, he asked about the co-operation of other members. All members are already supporting the activities of the Independent European Programme Group. We would hope that decisions would be taken unanimously at the meeting in view of the degree of support given, and see no reason why this should not be the case. The noble Lord also asked about the possibility of an American observer.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01865"><member>Lord Gladwyn</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this is an important point. Apparently the decisions are to be taken in principle by unanimity. It is possible that they may not be taken by unanimity but taken by some members deciding to do something and others not vetoing but abstaining.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01866"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my understanding of the position is as I have described it. Of course, we hope that the decisions can be taken unanimously. It may be that the position will arise as hinted by the noble Lord, but that is a hypothetical situation and we do not quite know. I accept that it is an important point but, as I said, we hope that the decisions will be taken unanimously.<lb/>
The noble Lord also asked about the possibility of an American observer. The revitalisation of IEPG is a result of United States pressure for Europe to come closer together, so what we want is a co-ordinated European response to the United States on such issues as emerging technology and the two-way street. The WEU, without impinging on the IEPG's practical work, can give a political impulse to this work of armaments collaboration which is vital to the effective functioning of our Alliance.<lb/>
Your Lordships will see that the Eurogroup and IEPG have a full and growing agenda. But there is still room for a forum in which the European allies, including France, can meet together to exchange views on major politico-security issues. Indeed, I fully endorse what noble Lords have said about the importance of France. European political co-operation already plays a limited role here particularly in relation to a number of disarmament questions. We would have wished to see security and defence issues formally included in the scope of political co-operation, as suggested by Herr Genscher and Signor Colombo; and we hope that this will in due course
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0221"/>
<col>425</col>
prove possible. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, has pointed out, there are political and procedural stumbling-blocks of a kind which need not arise in the same way in other fora.<lb/>
So what should WEU itself do, and what is it doing? The WEU has three particularly valuable features for the United Kingdom. First, it is bound to the North Atlantic Alliance Treaty. Second, as the noble Lord, Lord Mulley, pointed out, it provides the legal basis for our commitment of substantial land and air forces to the mainland of Europe&#x2014;a vital element both in our common defence and in our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, to which I attach so' much importance. Third, the WEU Assembly is the only European parliamentary forum empowered by treaty to discuss security and defence questions. It has&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01867"><member>Lord Mulley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Baroness mentioned some of the other items which can be done without a change in the Treaty. I believe that it is perhaps possible to make another very important change; namely, to have a separate representation to the Assembly from each member country and not necessarily, as we do now, have the same members of the Council of Europe. As the noble Baroness knows, one has to be appointed to membership of the Council of Europe and then one is allowed to go to the WEU Assembly, and not the other way round.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01868"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>; My Lods, I understand the point that the noble Lord is making. Perhaps he will allow me to write to him on whether or not this is something where each individual country can determine what it should do. I shall contact the noble Lord on that point.<lb/>
The purpose of the current re-launching of WEU is to exploit this potential to the full. The noble Lord, Lord Boston of Faversham, asked about the attitude of the Americans to reactivation. I can confirm that our American allies are content with what is being done. They naturally welcome a stronger European contribution to the common defence, and I believe that they see a better use of WEU as one means of helping to bring that about.<lb/>
The noble Lord also asked about the attitude of our other allies. Again, I can confirm that, naturally, they are interested in what is going on. We have decided with our WEU allies to keep them as fully informed as possible at every step. This will be done by the Presidency, through NATO channels.<lb/>
Your Lordships will have seen that Ministers agreed in Rome to harmonise their views on defence issues and also arms control and disarmament. Subjects that they will discuss include the impact of developments in East-West relations on the security of Europe, and Europe's contribution to the strengthening of the Atlantic Alliance, as well as co-operation in the field of armaments. They will also consider the implications for Europe of crisis in other regions of the world&#x2014;what in NATO terms are called "Out of Area Issues". Your Lordships will agree that an in-depth exchange of views on these issues is of value. I am glad to say that in Rome the Foreign and Defence Ministers of WEU made a good start to their consultations on these themes. My right honourable and learned friend the
<col>426</col>
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence took the lead in a most productive discussion of the European contribution to our common defence. The declaration issued after the meeting shows how much consensus there was among all participants on the fundamentals of European security and the guidelines for a better European contribution. I believe that the WEU Assembly, meeting today in Rome, in which some of your Lordships are taking part, will come to very similar conclusions. The decisions on WEU procedures also taken and announced at Rome should provide the right framework for further discussions among the seven member states in future.<lb/>
This is one very useful step forward. Others have been made and no doubt will be made in other contexts and other organisations. In this whole process our objective must be a stronger and more cohesive European contribution to the common defence in the alliance, and the strengthening of our links with North America and the United States commitment to our defence. The institutions that I have mentioned, including WEU, can all make their particular contribution to this end. Your Lordships have understandably expressed anxieties about the attitude of our other allies to this reactivation of WEU, but, as I have already indicated, most European allies not members of WEU have expressed interest, and the Rome Declaration, as I have already pointed out, provides for close consultation with them. One NATO ally, Portugal, has indicated a wish to join WEU, and others may be thinking along these lines. This is an interesting measure provoked by this meeting, and it is something that the council will carefully consider.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Kennet, asked about Norway and the threat to the flanks of the alliance. The alliance is well aware of this threat, and containing it is a matter for the alliance. Norway, along with other European members of NATO who are not also WEU members, has been kept informed of the reactivation of WEU. If Norway were to express a wish to accede to the Brussels Treaty, the WEU Council would undoubtedly consider that carefully, as it is going to do in the case of Portugal.<lb/>
In conclusion I would add only this. President Eisenhower said shortly after the conclusion of the Modified Brussels Treaty 30 years ago:
<quote>"The success of the Alliance will be determined in large measure by the degree of practical co-operation realised among the European nations themselves. The Western European Union and the related arrangements agreed upon in Paris are designed to ensure this co-operation and thereby to provide a durable base for consolidating the Atlantic relationship as a whole".</quote>
It is our job to prove him right. There is much work to do but these moves have come at the right time, and I believe that we are on the right track. It is now up to WEU governments and the Assembly to make the most of this opportunity.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARKING BAY SUSPENSIONS AND PENALTIES</title>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01898"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01899">Whether it is customary for a traffic warden to affix a fixed penalty notice under Section 80 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967 to a vehicle already lawfully parked in a residents' parking bay before the bay has been suspended.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01900"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member>: It would be unusual for a traffic warden to know that a particular vehicle had been parked in a bay before the bay had been suspended. Where the circumstances of the suspension are such that the owner or driver of a car could not reasonably be expected to know about the suspension the police will normally consider sympathetically applications for the fixed penalty notice or any charges to be cancelled. If the noble Earl has a particular incident in mind I should be happy to have inquiries made if he would let me have details.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01901"><member>The Marquess of Ailesbury</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01902">Whether they will confirm that statistics relating to road traffic accidents are not kept in respect of every road junction in the country; and whether it therefore follows that statistics issued by local authorities, claiming to list in order the worst so-called blackspots, should be regarded with a degree of scepticism.</p>
<col>430</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01903"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member>: Personal injury accidents reported to the police do have their grid-reference and junction type (if any) recorded in the statistics. Casualty figures for individual junctions can be specifically built up over a number of years and, with other data such as traffic flows, this enables local authorities to identify priorities for remedial measures.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01905">How much would the Central Electricity Generating Board of Great Britain have saved over the last year had they purchased foreign coal whenever it was cheaper than that obtainable from the National Coal Board.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01906"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (The Earl of Avon)</member>: Because of the lack of available port facilities, the costs involved in transporting coal to inland power stations, and the impact upon the international coal markets resulting from increased CEGB purchases, the extent to which hypothetical savings could in practice be achieved by opting for imported coal is uncertain. The unpredictability of future international coal prices and exchange rates is taken into account in the current "Understanding" between the CEGB and the NCB which represents a sensible basis for obtaining a more competitive NCB price for power station coal and enables both boards to benefit.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01929">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are still of the opinion that the Libyan presence at a school in Chelsea poses no threat to security.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01930"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the Jamahiriya School at Chelsea is a <i>bona-fide</i> educational establishment. If there were any reason to suppose that this establishment posed a threat to security, the police would take whatever action was necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01931"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that at any given time upwards of six cars with diplomatic number plates can be seen parked in the playground of this school, and that there is a constant coming and going of people whose appearance leads one to suppose that they have only a tenuous connection with the education of small children? Will the Minister assure the House that these premises have no form of diplomatic immunity and that there is in force a security operation which would give us early warning if the premises were being improperly used?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01932"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I cannot comment on the appearance of the people going in and out of the building. I am aware that a number of cars belonging to Libyan diplomats who were formerly resident in this country are parked at the Chelsea school pending their eventual disposal.

<title>"Generals For Peace" Organisation: Security</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01935">2.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01936"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the second Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01937">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01938">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are aware of the activities of the organisation known as "Generals for Peace"; and whether they are of the opinion that these activities are consistent with the maintenance of security in the free world.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01939"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Young)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are aware of the activities of this organisation, which originated in discussions at Sofia during a World Peace Council Congress in1980. The collective views of Generals for Peace and Disarmament are contrary to those of the Government and our allies. The Government's policy is of course to preserve the security of the United Kingdom and the countries of the Western Alliance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01940"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking the noble Baroness for that Answer, may I ask whether the Government are aware that of the eight founder members of this organisation, which purports to consist of NATO generals, four are members of the World Peace Council, a notorious Soviet front organisation? Is she further aware that the founder and controller of this organisation until very recently was Dr. Gerhard Kade, who is a senior figure in the Soviet propaganda apparatus? Is it not a matter of grave concern that an organisation posing as NATO Generals for Peace might be the instrument of disseminating Soviet disinformation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01941"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are fully aware of the close links between four of the original sponsors and five of the current 14 members of the so-called generals group and the World Peace Council. Dr. Gerhard Kade, their co-ordinator until last year, is also an official of the World Peace Council in Helsinki and of its subsidiary, the International Institute for Peace, in Vienna.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01942"><member>Lord Home of the Hirsel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that I can remember as far back as 1938 and a famous Secretary-General of the Communist Internationale giving instructions as to how to recruit people into the Russian peace organisations? His words, I remember, were, "One sympathiser, a writer of reputation or a retired general is worth more than 500 poor devils who know no better".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01943"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that this is an organisation of ex-generals and admirals of both the West and the East, and even those who have commanded United Nations forces? Is she further aware that its purpose is to prevent a nuclear war, with all its threat to mankind? Is that not the stated purpose of the Government, and therefore should not this organisation be welcomed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01944"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. These retired officers from NATO countries in no sense represent
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0226"/>
<col>435</col>
the alliance or their countries. They claim, in fact, that they are working for disarmament, but they have been strongly critical of Western strategy. They have particularly attacked the deployment of Cruise and Pershing II missiles. They have endorsed the Warsaw Pact disarmament proposals, and have wholly failed to protest at the Soviet Government's recent stationing of nuclear missiles in Czechoslovakia and East Germany.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01945"><member>The Earl of Kimberley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend agree that the danger of this type of Soviet disinformation is enhanced when two national newspapers like the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>Observer</i> publish accounts of Generals for Peace without any mention of their connections with the Soviet Union? Is she also aware that when this evidence was produced for the <i>Observer</i> the editor categorically refused to print it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01946"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am aware of the point that my noble friend has made. The fact is that in this country we have a tradition of responsible newspapers printing relevant facts, and any lapses from such a high standard would be regrettable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01947"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that the British officer among these generals is an officer with a distinguished record, whatever may be his views about strategy or armaments? Would it not be quite wrong to give the impression in this House that we all regard him as a mole, a red under the bed, or a communist stooge? Is he not entitled to his views on these matters without being so branded?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01948"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in a free society the officer in question is as entitled to express his views as anybody else. But it is a dangerous matter when the suggestion is made that these people are speaking on behalf of NATO or the NATO allies, or are writing on their behalf when, in fact, they are retired generals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01949"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Minister is right to say that this officer is as entitled to express his view as everyone else in this country. Is he also not entitled to be excluded from being described as a communist, a traitor, a red under the bed, or any other unpleasant name which people direct at him? Will the noble Baroness be quite clear in what she says about that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01950"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that in any of the exchanges that have taken place across the Floor of the House this afternoon anyone has described Brigadier Harbottle in those terms. What the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, drew attention to was the link between this organisation and the World Peace Council which I have supported.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01951"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad that the noble Baroness mentioned Brigadier Harbottle, but was it not quite clear from the implication of what was said by her and others that he was so regarded? Would she not agree that he is a distinguished ex-officer with a good record?</membercontribution></p>
<col>436</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01952"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we are not discussing the record of any particular person. The point that has been made in this exchange is that there is a link between this organisation and the World Peace Council.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01953"><member>Viscount Trenchard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware&#x2014;she seems to be very well aware of a great many of the activities of this organisation&#x2014;that ex-General M. H. von Meyenfeldt, who I understand is presently chairman of this posse of generals, wrote in the journal of the World Peace Council in October 1981:
<quote>"The foreign policy of the USA is aimed at retaining its position of strength and returning to its old plans of world domination"?</quote>
Does my noble friend agree that while we must be careful of spotting any particular reds under beds, we should also be careful of wolves in sheep's clothing and possibly even of bears in doves' plumage?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01954"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: Yes, my Lords, I would agree with my noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01955"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that if, instead of listening to this somewhat inflammatory Question and Answer, noble Lords would read the document <i>Generals for Peace and Disarmament</i>, which may be obtained in the Library, they would discover that the policies put forward by the Generals for Peace are almost identical in many respects with those of Her Majesty's Opposition?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01956"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Oh!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01957"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in these circumstances is it not highly undesirable that the defence committee of this House should be under the control of people who take such a biased view of the whole situation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01958"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not for me to show that the policy of Generals for Peace and the policy of Her Majesty's Opposition are the same. I should have thought that there were divided views on that matter. I would hope that that was the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01959"><member>Baroness Cox</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend the Minister aware that the organisation called the Centre for International Peacebuilding, which houses Generals for Peace and whose director is their administrator, has set up a registered charity called the Caroline Gourlay Trust? Might this matter not be brought to the urgent attention of the Charity Commission, in view of what many people regard as the blatantly pro-Soviet propaganda distributed by these organisations?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01960"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are very strict rules regulating the conduct of registered charities, particularly regarding activities of a political character. The points that my noble friend has made, if valid, are no doubt for the consideration of the Charity Commissioners or for my right honourable and learned friend the Attorney-General.</membercontribution></p>

Is she also aware that I accused no one of being a traitor, least of all the British member of this strange organisation? Is she aware that in my view the links between this organisation and the Soviet propaganda organisation are a matter of concern? Would she not agree that the fact that ex-NATO generals who held very high positions should now be meeting serving Soviet generals to discuss strategy in Western Europe is a matter of the gravest concern?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01962"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I agree with the points that the noble Lord, Lord Chalfont, has made. In fact, the meetings which have taken place, and the third meeting which has recently taken place in Vienna, have in many respects been gifts to Soviet propaganda. In practice these meetings have been stage managed by the Soviet-controlled International Institute for Peace&#x2014;the Vienna counterpart of the World Peace Council in Helsinki&#x2014;from whose former offices it operates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01963"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I trespass for one moment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01964"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins, would give way? We have been nine minutes on this Question.

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01965"><member>Lord Jenkins of Putney</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord. I merely wanted to ask the noble Baroness whether she was aware that what I am about to quote is from the pamphlet issued by Generals for Peace. This quotation will commend itself to the whole House:
<quote>"One must recognise the wisdom of the wartime slogan: 'Know your Enemy'."</quote></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-01968"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01969">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01970">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in view of their answer on 17th May last (col. 1504) and subsequent letter of 4th June to the Baroness Burton of Coventry concerning the right of the London Electricity Consultative Council to make further representations to the Secretary of State for Energy, they will indicate the present position on this matter.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01971"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment (The Earl of Avon)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that the London Electricity
<col>438</col>
Consultative Council, following its representations to the Electricity Council about the increase in domestic electricity prices last April, has not chosen to pursue the matter with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01972"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister recall that the central point at issue in all this was that the electricity industry was being required to make a separate grant to the Treasury in 1984&#x2013;85 of &#x00A3;360 million over and above the &#x00A3;380 million which would have been consistent with the financial target for that year? Does he also recall that the chairman of the Electricity Council, Mr. Jones, said that the &#x00A3;360 million was necessary neither on economic pricing grounds nor in order to meet the industry's current financial target? Furthermore, would the Minister accept that this was not an agreed figure but one imposed without any consultation at all?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01973"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords, I would not agree with what the noble Baroness says. We are now going back over the ground covered in April. At that stage a 2 per cent. increase in domestic prices was the subject of a challenge by the London Electricity Consultative Council, and the consultative council exercised its rights under statute formally to appeal. This rise of 2 per cent. was agreed by the Electricity Council and duly came into force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01974"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that I should like to know where he disgrees with me? It may be in the past; it relates to last February; but, certainly, what I stated is correct. I wonder if I might ask him whether he is denying that Mr. Jones, the chairman of the Electricity Council, did say that the charges were imposed without consultation and that the council gave way afterwards.<lb/>
As we are on this point, may I ask the noble Earl whether he is aware that the Government's attitude towards consumers is causing acute puzzlement and dismay among consumers? Does he recall that Mr. Alex Henney was not reappointed as chairman of the London Electricity Consultative Council in August and that many of us feel that Mr. Henney was not appointed because he was being a nuisance as he was endeavouring to give teeth to the council and was pursuing the Government on this particular matter?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01975"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Electricity Council proposed the 2 per cent. increase across the board which took place in the spring. Mr. Alex Henney was not reappointed. A new chairman has been appointed, a Mr. Bourne, and we wish him well.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01976"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Earl use this occasion to confirm to the House the unequivocal statement that he made to your Lordships' House last December that the Government had neither the power nor the wish to increase electricity or gas prices?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01977"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am happy to confirm what the noble Lord has said I said. I am delighted that he put it in a letter to <i>The Times</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0228"/>
<col>439</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01978"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Earl not agree that when a very well-informed critic such as Mr. Henney is not reappointed to his position it at least raises the suggestion that the Government are not interested in informed criticism on behalf of the consumers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01979"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I appreciate what the noble Baroness has said, but I personally was very stimulated by Mr. Henney's words and what he produced for the Government and would welcome his reappointment if he wished to serve on the national council. As far as the London council is concerned, at the end of his three years he was not reappointed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01980"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl the Minister has denied the assertion by the noble Baroness that no consultation took place, but he omitted to deal with her point that the chairman said that there had been no consultation. Would he care to reply to that point now?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01981"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is very difficult, when the noble Baroness produces a whole lot of sentences, to know to which particular sentence one is replying. As far as I am concerned, the consultative council is at the moment in consultation with the Ministry, and I am sure that this will be to the benefit of all concerned.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01982"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it in order, before asking another supplementary question, to ask the noble Earl to repeat the beginning of the last remark of his because I did not catch it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01983"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that the noble Baroness will have to wait for <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01984"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: So, my Lords, not waiting for <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, may I ask the Minister whether he recalls that last week in this House we discussed telephone charges which were being imposed with no consultation with the consumer organisation? Now we are discussing electricity charges which, equally, have been imposed without consultation. Is the Minister aware that consumer organisations just do not believe that the Government have any use for consumers at all except to call them in aid as a public relations exercise?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01985"><member>The Earl of Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all I can say to the noble Baroness is that, as far as I am concerned, when I was there, she is totally wrong. I initiated talks with the consumer councils, with the chairman, Mr. Hatch, and I understand that my successor is continuing these discussions.</membercontribution></p>

<title>European Monetary System and the UK</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01986">2.56 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01987"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01988">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01989">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they consider the circumstances are now right for the United Kingdom to join the European monetary system; and if not, why not.</p>
<col>440</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01990"><member>The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Arts (The Earl of Gowrie)</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords. When your Lordships last debated fully the question of sterling's participation in the exchange rate mechanism, my noble friend Lord Cockfield identified the difficulties created by the very different effects of uncertainty about the dollar and oil markets on European currencies, notably on sterling and the deutschemark. Both sources of uncertainty are clearly still affecting exchange markets at the present time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01991"><member>Baroness Seear</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Earl the Minister for that reply. Is it not very disappointing that for so long we have been told that at the right moment the Government will become a full member of the EMS? What is really holding it up at the present time?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01992"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not think that it is quite as disappointing as the noble Baroness makes out, because strictly speaking we are already a member of the EMS. We contribute 20 per cent. of our gold and dollar reserves to the European Monetary Co-operation Fund, and we participate in realignment conferences. The pound is also included as a component of the European currency unit. Sterling does not participate in the exchange rate mechanism because, as a petro-currency, it rises and falls with oil prices, while other Community currencies do precisely the opposite.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01993"><member>Lord Barnett</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the noble Earl mean that there are no circumstances in which we shall join the exchange rate mechanism?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01994"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: No, my Lords&#x2014;I dare not. As I said, I think that the time is not ripe mainly because our currency, unlike the European currencies, is linked to the rise and fall in oil prices.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01995"><member>Lord Bruce-Gardyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as a congenital waiverer on this issue, may I put a question to my noble friend? Does not past experience suggest that outside the exchange rate mechanism sterling tends to weaken less than the member currencies in the exchange rate mechanism when the dollar is strong, and to strengthen less than the member currencies in the exchange rate mechanism when the dollar is weak? Might this not suggest, given that so much of our own imports are actually denominated in dollars and given that if sterling were to strengthen substantially against the dollar this would assist in the abatement of inflation expectations, the moment at which we might contemplate joining the exchange rate mechanism would be the moment at which we had concluded that the dollar was finally turning turtle as at some stage it will, always supposing that we can identify that moment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01996"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am rather entranced by my noble friend's suggestion that he is a congenital waiverer about anything. It is certainly the case that membership of the exchange rate mechanism does not provide immunity from the effects of dollar strength on European currencies. Experience suggests that when the dollar shifts significantly downwards then the exchange rate mechanism comes under strong
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0229"/>
<col>441</col>
pressure. Since my noble friend and I both hope that this shift in the dollar will happen within the next six months or so, I think that my point is reasonably well taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01997"><member>Lord O'Brien of Lothbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on the assumption that Her Majesty's Government see the advantages of exchange rate stability, and that they say they will join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Community when the time is ripe, and having heard the Minister talk about the difference between sterling and the European currencies because sterling is a petro-currency, may I ask whether there is any early prospect of the Government's joining the exchange rate mechanism? I should have thought that that was a more or less permanent situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01998"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that the point I made in my first supplementary to the noble Baroness is the one that the noble Lord, Lord O'Brien, with all his experience in these matters, could perhaps take notice of: that we are already a very considerable participator in the European monetary system. The difficulty and the argument is about our participation in the exchange rate mechanism. It is not, I think, so much a question that this will be out of issue; that it will not be possible while we have oil assets. It will be more a question of Europe perhaps coming in line with a currency system that is less linked to oil assets.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-01999"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Earl aware that he seems to have gone back on the attitude of Her Majesty's Government with regard to this important issue? Would he care to make it absolutely clear that the Government are still in favour in principle of taking this further step? Is he further aware that there are many authoritative voices&#x2014;we have just heard one most authoritative voice and there are many others&#x2014;who take the view that it is extremely appropriate now to take that further step? If he is not in agreement with that as to timing, when can we look forward to the Government ending this question mark over their policy and making a clear decision?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02000"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it was, in fact, in your Lordships' House in November of last year that the Government gave their most recent and fully authoritative view of this position in a debate which enjoyed the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett. That was the point at which my predecessor my noble friend Lord Cockfield set out the position most authoritatively. He stated quite categorically that we were in favour of participating in the EMS&#x2014;and I have dealt with that point&#x2014;and that it would be in an ideal world a good thing to involve ourselves in the exchange rate mechanism, but that the timing was not right because of uncertainties in international currencies through their relationship with oil prices, which particularly affected ourselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02001"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02002"><member>Lord Denham</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, if the noble Lord will give way for half a minute, we have been 26 minutes on Questions already. We were two minutes on the first Starred Question, which means that we have had an average of eight minutes on the others. I understood
<col>442</col>
that his noble friend behind him was speaking from the Front Bench opposite, but if the noble Lord, Lord Bruce, would like to put his question quickly and if my noble friend would reply, perhaps we could then move on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02003"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for his courtesy. May I ask the noble Lord whether the Government's apparent uncertainty in this matter is perhaps due to the fact that the Government's prime objective may be that which was talked about by his right honourable friend the Prime Minister in March 1980, when she burst with pride when the dollar was standing at 2&#x00B7;40 to the pound and said that the high exchange rate was a matter of national pride?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02004"><member>The Earl of Gowrie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is always a matter of national pride when one's national assets are fetching very large sums of money. But in the real world in which we live the prices of raw materials fluctuate.</membercontribution></p>

<quote><i>Because it could result in unnecessary delay in transferring property, rights and liabilities in accordance with the Act</i>.</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02029"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member> rose to move, That this House do insist on Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have disagreed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02030">The noble Lord said: My Lords, the outcome of this debate is concerned with the rights of Parliament. The single central issue to be decided by your vote is not whether this Bill shall pass. That is not in dispute. It is not the principle underlying the Bill to place a public asset&#x2014;our ordnance factories&#x2014;into private hands. That is unchallenged. That principle, although opposed, is not in dispute.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02031">What is at issue is the right and the duty of Parliament to be given the opportunity to consider the details of the prime instrument transferring those powers contained within a scheme or schemes. It is the refusal by this Government to provide both Houses with that opportunity before such a scheme is started that is in dispute. Quite simply, opposition to our amendment denies proper parliamentary scrutiny. Those who believe that this House has a part to play in exercising proper parliamentary scrutiny will support the amendment. The issue is as simple as that.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02032">In another place, the Minister in charge of the Bill called the scheme nothing more than
<quote>"conveyancing machinery for transferring property from the Secretary of State to the new company".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02033">He chided my honourable friends for being concerned with the details of the scheme. What reason do the Government give to your Lordships' House for asking it to reject the amendment which we in this House passed but three months ago? I quote: "Because it could result in unnecessary delay". I ask your Lordships to note that it is not "delay", but "unnecessary delay". I ask the question in all seriousness. Surely it will be a sad day if the proper accounting to Parliament by Government and the proper scrutiny of that accounting to Parliament is viewed as unnecessary. In a saga stretching over many months, even years, what would be unnecessary? It could be as little as hours of parliamentary time&#x2014;hours, my Lords, not days or weeks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02034">The truth is that the Government will not tolerate or brook any delay by anybody, including either or both
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0231"/>
<col>445</col>
Houses of Parliament. That is the measure of the Government's desperate and intolerable haste. What do the Government want no unnecessary delay to interfere with? I quote again:
<quote>"with transferring property, rights and liabilities in accordance with the Act".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02035">We have no details of substance relating to land, buildings, machines, intellectual rights, valuations. There is no conclusion to the protracted negotiations with the trade unions on pension rights, redundancy terms, negotiating rights. Yet the Government seek approval to proceed, come what may.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02036">What awkward questions do the Government think Parliament can ask, and why do they deny to Parliament the right to ask those questions? I tell this noble House that if a Labour Government came to either House, said that they wanted to take an industry into public ownership and asked for the principle of that decision to be agreed by the House without giving details of compensation, organisation or the transfer of liabilities, there would be a tremendous outcry from the Conservative Benches&#x2014;and rightly so. Labour would be accused of riding roughshod over Parliament. We should be told, in the words of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor, that we had an elective dictatorship.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02037">Noble Lords do not have to take my words. When we debated and determined this very issue in your Lordships' House on 19th July of this year the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, said at col. 1635:
<quote>"In all my experience of legislation &#x2026; I have never seen a Bill which consults Parliament so little, and indeed which scorns Parliament in the way it gives all power to the Government and to the Minister and none to anybody else".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02038">That was a devastating indictment. We shall hear that there is no time, that deadlines have to be met, that all has been revealed, that the Minister has nothing to hide; yet for more than nine months Parliament has been fobbed off with promise after promise after promise.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02039">Where is the memorandum of understanding? Where are the articles of agreement? Three months ago we were told that they were in final draft. Where are they now? Where are the details of the intellectual property rights? The Minister said in February, nine months ago, that they would be produced in three months' time. Six months after that promise, where are they? The noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran, and the noble Lord, Lord Mayhew, have repeatedly asked for details. Those details have been promised but have never been given. The noble Baroness, Lady Vickers, and the noble Lord, Lord Carver, have asked questions time after time, but in vain. We have asked for details of the valuation of assets. All we have been promised in the scheme is a statement of the principles of the valuations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02040">What will be the capital structure of the company? We do not know. How will assets be transferred? We do not know. The scheme is the heart of the Bill, yet it is the intention of the Government, in Clause 3(9), not just to lay a copy of the scheme and allow for no debate upon it but to do so up to one month after&#x2014;I repeat after&#x2014;the scheme has come into force. Surely this cannot be right. Surely it lacks courtesy to Parliament. Surely it is undemocratic.</p>
<col>446</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02041">Let me repeat, in order to reassure those who share my concern over constitutional proprieties, that the amendment which I move seeks to provide both Houses of Parliament with an opportunity to exercise their duty and their rights. It is designed to enable proper parliamentary scrutiny. It is not a challenge to the principle of the Bill. It is not a wrecking amendment. It is not a delaying device. It will force the Government to treat Parliament not as a rubber stamp but as a responsible element in our legislative procedures. By supporting this amendment, noble Lords are doing no more than is their duty. We cannot do less. I ask your Lordships to support the Motion.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02042">Moved, That this House doth insist on Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have disagreed.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Graham of Edmonton</i>.)</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02044"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that it would be more convenient if I said what I have to say now rather than after the Minister has responded to the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton.<lb/>
I am most anxious to do everything I can to satisfy your Lordships that this is not a party or partisan matter. That was the principle of the Bill and it has been disposed of. Both Third Reading and the Question, That the Bill do now pass have been settled in both Houses of Parliament. We are concerned solely with whether we should insist upon Parliament being consulted. We are not asking for power to alter any detail. Merely do we insist upon Parliament being consulted in circumstances in which the Government have chosen to introduce an enabling Bill which, as I said on a previous occasion, is enabling with a capital "E".<lb/>
The Bill gives to the Minister, and only to the Minister, enormous powers to privatise, as everybody knows, part of the supply of materials which affect the security of this country. This has continued for 400 years or more and has never been in hands other than those of the Crown. The Government are doing it by means of an enabling Bill which has only one effective clause: the power to make a scheme. We know very little indeed about what the scheme will contain. I put it to all noble Lords that it is no less than minimum courtesy and a matter of reasonable consultation with both Houses of Parliament for the Government at least to say what is in the scheme before, not after, it has become effective.<lb/>
The Government do not dispute that Parliament is entitled to know. They say that the scheme will be published within one month after it has become effective. There is no dispute about that. We are all agreed that Parliament should know. The issue is when Parliament should know. Should it know at a time when it can express its view, at a time when the Government would have to justify&#x2014;this is at the heart of democratic proceedings&#x2014;and persuade all Members of both Houses that the course they have taken is reasonable?<lb/>
If the Government had given to Parliament adequate details of what is to be included in the scheme, we should not be pursuing the matter. The details are important. There is no question that many of the most important details are still open&#x2014;details
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0232"/>
<col>447</col>
affecting the employment, redundancy conditions, pension rights and other rights of a huge labour force which was totally loyal and totally strike-free until the introduction of the Bill. They are concerned about the prospect of up to 1,600 people being declared redundant in any week. Whether that will be before or after the scheme is introduced, one does not know. They do not know for certain what their future will be. Nor do the Government.<lb/>
The Government say, very properly, that certainty can be obtained only by consulting the courts. That is a reasonable statement, but surely it is reasonable for Parliament to be given the opportunity to know the Government's proposals on a number of vital issues. How is the company going to be run? That is called a memorandum of understanding. What it means is, how is the company going to be run? It is going to be wholly owned by the Secretary of State. How is he going to exercise his powers? Answer: under a memorandum of understanding. What is the memorandum going to say? We do not know. Time and time again the Government have promised to produce it, but they have not produced it for the best of all reasons; they have not yet decided what the memorandum of understanding is going to say. One can continue in this way on a number of most important issues.<lb/>
A whole series of assets is going to be transferred? Which assets? I am sorry, but neither the Government nor I can tell you, because the Government have not yet decided. How are the assets going to be valued? I am sorry, but neither the Government nor I can tell you, because the Government have not decided what are the principles of valuation. They decided earlier that there was a principle, which they promulgated, though I had never heard of it before, notwithstanding having spent a lifetime in my profession. It was the principle of usefulness. That did not last long, and they have withdrawn from that. I can only help your Lordships by saying which principle will not be adopted; but I cannot be more constructive and say which principle will be adopted for valuing the assets, nor which assets will be transferred, nor, when they are transferred, how the business will be run.<lb/>
Good heavens! Have I not put before your Lordships sufficient information to establish the point that it is reasonable that Parliament should be consulted before the event, and not after it, so that it can express its views? We all know that Parliament can express its views only when dealing with an affirmative resolution, which takes half a day in another place (and that is the amount of the delay involved) and perhaps half a day in your Lordships' House; a total of one day. That is what we are talking about&#x2014;whether that is a price worth paying to consult Parliament.<lb/>
The Government are saying that that is a price not worth paying and that it is unnecessary to incur that delay. I am inviting your Lordships to take quite the opposite view and say the other place should consider on this procedure&#x2014;an affirmative resolution&#x2014;whether the Government have filled in these vitally important question marks reasonably; or if not, what suggestions they have to make. As we all know, there is no question but that the Government, commanding the majority which they do, will get their
<col>448</col>
way. The Government must, and should, get their way at the end of the day, after Parliament has been consulted. There is no difficulty about that position. There is no difficulty about the constitutional position, the procedural position or any of those matters. It is simply an issue of whether that kind of delay can be described as unnecessary.<lb/>
I hope very much that your Lordships will accept my assurance that I have tried to take out of my mind completely the fact that every opposition party in both Houses, as well as ex-Secretaries of State and distinguished ex-Chiefs of General Staff have all opposed this Bill. I have tried to take out of my mind the point that when this very amendment was being considered in another place not one Member spoke in support of the amendment against this amendment and in support of the Government. Certainly they voted in support of it, and the noble and learned Lord who sits on the Woolsack will not be surprised at that. He has described this pattern of voting in language which I would not attempt to improve upon.<lb/>
The issue is not whether the Government can get their majority at the right time in another place; of course they can. And once they have voted on a Motion of this kind, we in this House&#x2014;and certainly we on these Benches, for whom I speak with authority&#x2014;would not dream of opposing by a vote that which the other place has decided, because we would then be challenging the other House in such a way that it could not think again. That is not the function of your Lordships' House.<lb/>
We are absolutely on safe ground in respect of the constitutional, procedural, and other considerations. We are not damaging the Bill in a central way at all. We are asking the Government to reconsider and to do what everybody who has spoken has asked them to do: please consult Parliament before, and not after, the event.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02045"><member>Baroness Vickers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall say only a few words. I had down two amendments concerning this proposition in Committee and at Report stage. It is a very great experiment after 300 years completely to change the lives of the people who are working in these factories. I should like to say that they have done a wonderful job. Now they are not going to be civil servants and they will have a different type of master. They will have a different type of life, and we still do not know what pensions they are to receive. We have a rough idea, but we do not know. I really think it is essential to receive reports from the Ministry and I should like to suggest that if we cannot get this amendment through, we put down Unstarred Questions from time to time in order to get the information we require.<lb/>
I hope that we shall stick by our feelings on this matter, even if this Bill goes through. I have worked in these factories and have some knowledge of what is done there and what has been done there in the past. When I was working in them I did not always feel that the arrangements were satisfactory. Conditions may become a little better now that the factories will be subject to different health and safety Acts. But if we are going to let this Bill go through, we want to be quite sure that certain matters are going to be put right and
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0233"/>
<col>449</col>
that the people working there will have a better life and a better living.<lb/>
I support what has been said by the noble Lord who spoke for the Opposition and I wish to say that I would be prepared to put down an Unstarred Question so that we can learn more about what is happening in these factories in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02046">3.27 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02047"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the other place has given as its reason for disagreeing with this amendment that,
<quote>"it could result in unnecessary delay in transferring property, rights and liabilities in accordance with the Act".</quote>
The delay would clearly be appreciable. Arrangements for the necessary debates could not be made until all work on the scheme had been completed, since it is implicit in the amendment that the scheme must be approved in the form in which it will ultimately be made.<lb/>
The scheme would need to be laid before Parliament well before the debates were to take place, in order to allow honourable Members in another place, and your Lordships here, time to consider it. The Government would have to take into account the possibility that one House, or both Houses, might withhold approval to the scheme. It would therefore not be possible to fix a definite date for vesting day until both debates had been held. On the other hand, the need to plan ahead would require the setting of a provisional date, with the hope of being able to keep to it. Probably, in order to cater for all eventualities, delay between the finalising of the scheme and vesting day would have to be in the order of months rather than weeks.<lb/>
There is much to be done to weld the existing organisation into a coherent, independent, commercial entity. No real progress can be made in this direction until total independence is achieved by vesting day. The sooner the company can get going, the sooner it can start to build on the success of the ROF trading fund and begin to achieve some of the aims we would expect of it. Unnecessary delay in reaching vesting day would incur the risk of diluting the enthusiasm which now exists within management, lowering the morale of both management and workforce, and jeopardising early attainment of the Government's objectives.<lb/>
That risk should be incurred only for sound reasons. Such reasons are, of course, said to exist in this case. The Government are said to be abusing the democratic process in not subjecting the scheme to parliamentary scrutiny and approval before it comes into effect. I find that a curious charge after the numerous debates we have held, both in your Lordships' House and in the other place; the Questions which have been put to us and answered; and the explanations we have given of our future intentions. It really is not credible to suggest that the Government's intentions have not been revealed, or subjected to detailed examination.<lb/>
Much of the criticism that is made of the Government in this respect comes, I think, from a mistaken idea of what the scheme will contain. It was described in the other place by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Defence Procurement as a conveyancing document. This description was
<col>450</col>
somewhat scathingly received there by the Opposition. But the fact of the matter is that it is a conveyancing document. It is a mechanism for transferring property from the Secretary of State to the new company more easily and more conveniently than the usual legal instruments. I wonder whether, if the property were being transferred in the normal way, there would be the same wish to approve the various deeds of conveyance and leases, drawn up by the lawyers, before they came into effect. I very much doubt it.<lb/>
The truth is that the scheme will contain little or nothing concerning the matters in which Parliament has, quite rightly, expressed the greatest interest. The scheme will be a very limited document consisting mostly of lists of property and other assets to be transferred, stating the number of shares which are to be issued in consideration of the transfer and setting out the conditions on which certain property, most notably intellectual property rights, is to be held by the new company. There will be nothing in it which we have not already made abundantly clear to Parliament on many different occasions, and Parliament's knowledge of the issues will not be advanced in any significant degree by the scheme when it is published.<lb/>
The matters of greatest concern to Parliament, such as the value of the new company, the details of the new company pensions schemes, the policies of the Ministry of Defence towards the new company and the plans which the Government have for privatisation will be nowhere mentioned in the scheme. But these, and other matters like them, are the things in which Parliament is really interested. A debate purporting to be on the scheme would inevitably turn into a general debate on these topics. But it is the Government's case that we have had sufficient debate of that kind already and that there is no advantage in discussing the matter further which is sufficient to compensate for the damage which additional delay would cause to the company and the implementation of the Government's plans. The Government are not abusing the Parliamentary process. They are trying to determine the balance of convenience between competing courses of action. It is our belief that Parliament has had, and will have in the future as my noble friend Lady Vickers so rightly pointed out, all the information it has wanted concerning our intentions.<lb/>
We shall lay the scheme before Parliament. We shall publish the opening balance sheet of the new company. We shall make statements of our intentions at the appropriate time. All this will enable Parliament to ask questions and make points about what we are doing and intend to do. I ask your Lordships to be content to leave it at that, and not introduce the prospect of additional and unnecessary delay in reaching vesting day by insisting on this amendment to the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02048"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, can he add, in fairness to the House, what he means when he says that the scheme will be put before Parliament? When will it be put before Parliament?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02049"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we have had a long debate on these and related matters. Perhaps I could say in parenthesis that the articles of association, in which I know the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, is
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0234"/>
<col>451</col>
particularly interested, have now been placed in the Library of your Lordships' House, save for one particular clause which will have to be added at a later date and which is not appropriate at the present time. The time at which we were proposing to publish the scheme is immediately after vesting day, and I hope that the noble Lord will regard that as satisfactory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02050"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend sits down, may I ask whether he can confirm, as much has been said about the constitutional position, that the constitutional position is the same for enabling Bills, whether they have a large "E" or a small "e", as for all other Bills, and whether he can assure the House that there is no constitutional impropriety involved?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02051"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I hasten to give my noble friend the assurance for which he asks. Of course there is no constitutional impropriety in this Bill. The Bill has now passed effectively through both Houses save for the small remaining matter we are discussing today. Therefore, I hope that in due course it will become the law of the land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02052"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I begin by saying to the noble Lord who has just spoken that there is no challenge from this side that there is any constitutional impropriety in what the Government are doing; and we were at pains to point out that there is no constitutional impropriety in what we are seeking to do. In other words, we are saying to the Government that in this debate we have not sought to argue the, merits. We have argued, and we have lost. The parliamentary arithmetic stands up pretty well in both Houses. We are not arguing about the principle: that has gone. We are arguing about the opportunity which the Government have, and which they decline to take, of taking Parliament into their confidence, treating it with a little more respect and simply saying to us, "Although we are intending to do something, before we do so this is what we intend to do."<lb/>
The Minister says "within one month", and the Bill says, in Clause 3(9):
<quote>"Within the period of one month beginning with the day on which a scheme comes into force".</quote>
In other words, we are going to be told within one month after a scheme comes into force. It might be one week, two weeks or three weeks, or it might be four weeks. We are saying to the Government that that is a tiny price to pay in order to keep the confidence and satisfaction of the House on their side.<lb/>
I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, who quite properly stressed that there is no challenge to the principle of the Bill. He pointed out that it is an enabling Bill with enormous powers. We are not talking about the transfer of fish or fruit, or anything like that: we are talking about the transfer of assets which at the moment form part of the national security of the state. I appreciate that the Minister has told us that safeguards have been written in, but this is an enormous transfer of assets of what I say are a unique kind.<lb/>
The Minister alluded to the information that has been given over the period by his good self and his
<col>452</col>
parliamentary colleagues in another place. I have not argued that from the time the Bill received its First Reading in another place until now there has not been adequate time for debate. The problem of those who asked the questions is that they received promises, promises and more promises as to when they were going to see a little more flesh on the bones, but we have not seen it. I remember that it was nine or 10 days ago that my noble friend Lord Stoddart asked if he could sight something, and he was told that it was available. We are told it is available now. It might have been available for a longer period than that. I do not believe that my noble friend Lord Stoddart has had an opportunity to see that document.<lb/>
I take very kindly the reference by the noble Baroness, Lady Vickers, that if the Government do not accept our amendment there are other legitimate devices that we can use. Of course there are, but we ought not to adopt guerilla warfare tactics in order to get what Parliament ought to be given freely. We ought to be able to say to the Government, "Trust us. Trust us and give us the information." I think that the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, hit the nail right on the head. The Government are literally making it up, not as they go along, because there are problems, but they are not yet in a position to produce the finished goods. We are saying, "Right; but when you do produce the finished goods simply consult us before going on".<lb/>
I am grateful for the support that we on these Benches have received all round the House, not only today but at other stages of the Bill. I beg the Minister seriously to recognise the deep feelings which have been expressed and to reflect on the enormity of the actions which are contained in the enabling powers. The Government intend to take those powers, and they are entitled to, but it will take out of the public domain an organisation&#x2014;the Royal Ordnance Factories&#x2014;which has served the nation faithfully and well for more than 400 years.<lb/>
All that we are asking for in this simple amendment is an opportunity for debate in both Houses of Parliament before that dissolution of public assets takes effect. The noble Lord, Lord Diamond, was absolutely right. The price that we are asking the Government to pay is one three-hour debate in each House. Surely that is a small request. What have the Government to fear? Why incur the wrath of the workforce and damage the Government's democratic integrity for such a tiny price? Why imply that neither House of Parliament, nor any of their Members, is capable of offering suggestions to improve the details of the scheme by not giving them the opportunity to comment before this change comes into effect?<lb/>
Earlier this year the Grant to Redundant Churches Fund Order 1984 was approved by Parliament and this Government. That is subject to the affirmative procedures which I seek in this amendment. I cannot believe that it is right to treat our ordnance factories with less dignity and respect than redundant churches. I ask the House to support the Motion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Ethiopia: Famine Relief</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02057">3.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02058"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your Lordships' permission, I should now like to repeat a Statement being made in the other place by my right honourable friend the Minister for Overseas Development about famine relief for Ethiopia. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"The House knows of the very deep concern felt throughout the country at the effects of famine in Ethiopia&#x2014;and indeed in other countries. Last Wednesday my right honourable and learned friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs announced three important further measures designed to help tackle the problem. These follow the substantial steps that we and the European Community were already taking&#x2014;almost &#x00A3;10 million from the British aid programme in the last 18 months, including our share of over &#x00A3;22 million from the European Community.<lb/>
"The new measures were: first, the despatch by the United Kingdom of a further 6,000 tonnes of
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0236"/>
<col>455</col>
food aid; second, the allocation of a further &#x00A3;5 million for spending on famine relief in Ethiopia and other African countries; and, third, a pledge to press the European Community for additional action.<lb/>
"The House will wish me to report on the action we have put in hand.<lb/>
"On Saturday night, my noble friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Trefgarne, and I met in London Commissioner Dawit, head of the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission.<lb/>
"I informed him of the additional 6,000 tonnes of grain, which will be shipped within the next few days. We discussed ways of speeding up the transport and distribution of supplies through the port. I agreed that we should draw on our &#x00A3;5 million offer to provide dump trucks to help with unloading at the port of Assab and Land Rovers and spare parts for them to help with distribution. I also agreed to supply water drilling rigs and medical requirements. In addition, we told him of our offer of a Royal Air Force detachment of two Hercules aircraft and the appropriate support to undertake internal relief operations within the famine areas. There was some discussion about this offer, but I can tell the House that it has been agreed that we will make the detachment available for three months. The initial deployment will involve several additional flights to Ethiopia to ensure that our detachment is self-sufficient and fully equipped for the task. So far as we are concerned, the first two aircraft are ready to leave tomorrow. Two RAF officers have now arrived in Addis Ababa to discuss urgently the practical arrangements.<lb/>
"I am sure that these aircraft will make a very valuable contribution to distributing food where it is most needed.<lb/>
"I have also agreed to make available two further civil aircraft&#x2014;one of them a Hercules&#x2014;to support the voluntary agencies, who are doing such a fine job in Ethiopia. Both will take out relief supplies and the Hercules will stay in Ethiopia for some weeks for use by the International Committee of the Red Cross. We are also paying for some of the supplies needed. I had this morning a constructive discussion of priorities and implementation with the Disasters Emergency Committee led by Lord Hunt.<lb/>
"All this represents a very significant British contribution. In addition, the European Community is taking valuable action.<lb/>
"So far this year the European Community has already made direct allocations of 53,000 tonnes of cereals and 3,000 tonnes of other products to Ethiopia. But the needs of Ethiopia are so great that we have pressed the Community to do more. Following my right honourable friend the Prime Minister's message to Dr. FitzGerald, President of the European Council, the Council's Budget Committeee has approved and the European Parliament is to consider today a special programme of food and transport assistance worth &#x00A3;20 million, of which the British share would be about &#x00A3;4.5 million.<lb/>
<col>456</col>
"The needs of Ethiopia and other parts of drought-stricken Africa will be further discussed by Community Foreign Ministers in Ireland at the end of the week and by the Development Council&#x2014;which I shall attend&#x2014;in Brussels next Tuesday.<lb/>
"We have been active in other international organisations. The Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes (the CFA), the supervisory body of the World Food Programme, is currently meeting in Rome. On a British initiative the meeting is giving priority to the needs of Ethiopia.<lb/>
"At the same time, other Western donors have offered increased assistance.<lb/>
"The grave problem of drought in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa cannot be solved overnight or by one massive airlift. But the measures we have announced are valuable in themselves and have given an important lead."<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02059"><member>Lord Oram</member><membercontribution>: My Lord, I should first like to thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement made in another place. On behalf of my noble friends I wish to express satisfaction that arrangements have now been made for providing air transport to help with this rescue operation in Ethiopia.<lb/>
Should I take it from the Statement that the difficulties that were first encountered with the Ethiopian representative, in respect of the air transport, have now been overcome?<lb/>
We appreciate the fact that the Government have now made an increased offer of aid in response to the very great public concern that has arisen about this tragic situation. However, are there not two important lessons to be derived from the experience of the last few days? The first is that the existence of voluntary agencies, such as the Save the Children Fund, Oxfam and War on Want, is a tremendous asset in these situations, and that they are therefore worthy of the fullest backing by both the public and the Government. Indeed, not infrequently they lead where governments follow.<lb/>
Secondly, should we not realise that this is not a crisis which has suddenly come upon us? Warnings have been given by the voluntary agencies over many months. I recall that in a debate which I initiated in your Lordships' House some 18 months ago my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition gave a specific and urgent warning of the developing crisis and urged that appropriate action should then be taken.<lb/>
I welcome what the Statement says about initiatives being taken within the European Community and in other international bodies. However, should not those bodies not only be concerned with measures to meet the present emergency situation, but also be planning for the long term, so as to avoid repetitions of this tragedy time after time in the months and years ahead? It should not be a matter of a month's effort; it should be a long-term and continuing effort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02060"><member>Lord Walston</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord for repeating the statement and to the Government for their response to the public's demand
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0237"/>
<col>457</col>
for more help to famine-stricken Ethiopia. It certainly is welcome that they have now worked generously and fast in giving this aid. I hope I shall not appear to be carping if I express regret that the Government have taken so long to respond to the requests which have been put to them over many months, as I understand it.<lb/>
I am glad that the noble Lord paid tribute to the voluntary agencies. In that connection I should like to ask him when it was that the Government first received warnings from any of the voluntary agencies, such as Oxfam, Christian Aid, and War on Want, as to the state of affairs which had already arisen many months earlier in Ethiopia and which inevitably was going to escalate at a terrifying rate, as we have now seen.<lb/>
Secondly, would not the Minister agree that valuable though this help is&#x2014;in particular not only the supply of grain, but also the transport to move the grain to where it is needed&#x2014;the amount that is given will very soon be exhausted and in the months ahead there will be a need for yet more aid, especially in the supply of grain?<lb/>
Would the Minister not also agree with this? Both this country and the Community as a whole have now enjoyed the heaviest cereal harvest that they have ever reaped, so that they now have a surplus running into many millions of tonnes. Are the Government thinking in terms of making some of this available to meet the continuing needs of both Ethiopia and other countries, either directly from this country or preferably through the Community?<lb/>
Finally, may I remind the noble Lord&#x2014;if, indeed, he needs reminding&#x2014;that this is not just one urgent short-term need? No matter what happens to the weather, no matter what happens to the civil war and no matter what happens to the internal government in Ethiopia, the need will inevitably exist for at least another 12 and probably 18 months, and thereafter there will be need for a different form of aid through different forms of voluntary agency, such as, for example, Voluntary Service Overseas and the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which the noble Lord, through his handling of these matters, knows well. Will the Government consider increasing the funds available for those two organisations so as, in the long term, to prevent a recurrence of the types of famine we are now hearing about?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02061"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am obliged to both noble Lords. I can confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Oram, that some initial problems in connection with the aircraft have been overcome and that our offer has been gratefully accepted. As for the voluntary agencies, I wholly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oram, that they play an invaluable role in situations of this sort. Of course, they often have access to these places and to information to a much greater extent than governments. That is why we support them as much as we can whenever we can.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Oram, said that this was not a sudden crisis but that it had been with us for some considerable time. That was also much in the mind of the noble Lord, Lord Walston. It is indeed the case that we have for some time been very anxious about
<col>458</col>
the situation in Ethiopia. But, contrary to misleading reports, we have been helping that country for a number of years. While it is true that we have only a very limited development programme there, British aid from 1973 to 1981 averaged over &#x00A3;2 million a year, rising in 1982 to &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;6 million, of which &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;2 million was given as food aid in response to the effects of the drought, then in its early stages.<lb/>
Over the past two years British aid to Ethiopia has been worth more than &#x00A3;13 million, including our share of European Community support. We are not making a belated response to the drought: we have done much already. Indeed, as recently as this last July we cancelled Ethiopia's aid debts to Britain, which at that time were worth more than &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million. I think it is right to say that this is, indeed, a long-term problem which will need long-term solutions. But, on the other hand, there is clearly an immediate short-term problem as well, and that is why we have moved as we have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02062"><member>Lord Chelwood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, a great deal of attention has been focused on the large-scale tragedy in Ethiopia during the last week or 10 days. Indeed, my noble friend's Statement has been almost entirely about the starvation and near starvation on a large scale in Ethiopia. However, as he said three times in his Statement, similar tragedies are being experienced in other countries in Africa, without looking beyond that continent. Can my noble friend assure the House that, so far as this is possible to arrange, there is a fair division of aid given from voluntary and governmental sources among all those countries in Africa where there is starvation or near starvation on a large scale?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02063"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, we shall certainly do our best to assist in situations like those to which my noble friend refers. That is why my right honourable friend said in his earlier statement last week that the &#x00A3;5 million for spending on famine relief would be available in Ethiopia and, indeed, in other African countries, although I must say that in present circumstances I anticipate that the lion's share will go to Ethiopia.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02064"><member>Baroness Hylton-Foster</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that the British Red Cross is very grateful to the Government for supplying them with a Hercules aircraft which will enable them to take to the disaster area vehicles, shelters, tents and blankets? Will the noble Lord also agree how fortunate we are to be working with a very efficient and splendid Ethiopian Red Cross Society, which is working with the International Committee of the Red Cross, with the League of Red Cross Societies and with our own society; which is itself supplying nurses and doctors to look after the sick; and which is also very busy helping to feed at the feeding centres the pregnant women and nursing mothers, who represent over 50 per cent. of the population? Is the noble Lord aware that, because of the overcrowding, there is still a very terrible problem there?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02065"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that the noble Baroness is right. The Government were very pleased to be able to assist the International Committee of the Red Cross in the way that we did. We have provided
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0238"/>
<col>459</col>
for them, or paid for, a civil Hercules aircraft. That is not, of course, one of the RAF ones.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02066"><member>Lord Somers</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will the noble Lord observe that while the difficulties which have been set up by the Ethiopian Marxist Government have now been largely overcome, many of us who wished to give a contribution to some of the voluntary organisations have been told that it was no use because it simply was not getting there? I do not know whether that is no longer the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02067"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are really two separate aspects to the present problem. The first is to ensure that there are sufficient supplies of food in particular available in or near Ethiopia. The second is to distribute those supplies within that country. Frankly, the quantities of grain either available or shortly to arrive in Ethiopia are quite considerable. The principal problem, now, I think, is to ensure effective distribution throughout that country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02068"><member>Lord Maude of Stratford-upon-Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while no one would doubt the need for considerable quantities of food aid to Ethiopia and other countries in Africa and elsewhere, is my noble friend aware that this is a problem that will be with us year after year after year, and possibly over an increasing area of Africa, unless something is done effectively about short-sighted methods of agriculture and inadequate policies of aforestation and irrigation? Will he say what the international agencies are doing to grapple seriously with this problem in the long term?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02069"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think that my noble friend has probably put his finger on the essence of this problem. The long-term solution is certainly, I think, in the direction that my noble friend points. We are therefore working vigorously with the agencies concerned to try to see that that can happen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02070"><member>Lord John-Mackie</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, further to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Maude, about there being a short-term problem within a long-term one, is the Minister aware that the noble Lord, Lord Walston, mentioned a period of 12 to 18 months, while I would put the long-term problem at 12 to 18 years? The period to which the noble Lord, Lord Maude, referred, I would put nearer to 50 years. When you consider that it took us from 1935 to the present day to achieve a 150 per cent. increase in our food production, it would take just about as long, if not longer, bearing in mind the conditions in these areas. So we have really three problems: the short-term, the 18-month one of feeding these hungry people: the long-term one of meeting the needs of 400 million people in the world who are below the level of proper nutrition; and then the very long-term one. I recall that when I first came into this House there was a debate on this subject when the noble Lord, Lord Renton, made this very point. It has taken us a long time to take real cognisance of the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02071"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord is, I think, quite right to point to the long-term nature of the problem. The problems arise from the difficult
<col>460</col>
terrain in that country, poverty, a civil war, a growing population which, in recent years, has increased very dramatically and, I have to say, a collectivised system of agriculture, introduced some years ago, which has not contributed to the solution of the food shortage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02072"><member>The Earl of Halsbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I reinforce the questions put by the last two speakers? When I was chairman of the Meteorological Office I was aware that, for many years past, there had been climatic changes going on in the Horn of Africa and that we must expect them for the time being to continue more or less indefinitely. What sort of temporal perspective is the noble Lord applying to the situation created by these long-term climatic changes?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02073"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I would need to reflect a little on the particular climatic implications of the noble Earl's question. But the fact of the matter, as the noble Earl rightly says, is that there has been a drought situation emerging in Ethiopia for 20 years at least, which I imagine goes back at least as far as the time when the noble Earl was concerned with these things.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02074"><member>Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I warmly welcome the rapid action taken by the Government over the last few days and the action taken by the voluntary organisations. May I warmly support the proposals put by the noble Lord. Lord Maude, and my noble friend Lord John-Mackie, and press the Government to take some initiative in regard to longer-term action? Would the Minister not agree that the agencies do exist, through the United Nations and in other forms? The problem, for political and other reasons, is to get the Governments of Africa, of the countries which are affected by this constant annual drought, lasting over a very long period, to co-operate.<lb/>
Does the Minister not believe that the time has come for Her Majesty's Government to take a very positive and constructive initiative through the agencies concerned? They have taken a short-term initiative now with the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes. I do not ask the Minister necessarily to give an answer now, but I should like him to give an undertaking that he will discuss this matter with his right honourable friend and in due course give us some indication what initiatives he thinks might be profitable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02075"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Lord's response to the rapid arrangements that we have been able to make in this matter. Perhaps it is worth saying that I think we are the first Western Government to announce precisely what we are doing in this tragic situation, although other governments, I believe, are close behind us. As to the long-term solution&#x2014;if I may say so, so much in the minds of your Lordships at this moment&#x2014;I certainly agree that we need to be looking to create an effective programme, probably through the international agencies, for the solution of this problem in the long-term; and my right honourable friend will be thinking very hard about that.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02082"><b>1</b> Clause 1, page 1, line 7, after ("constable") insert ("in uniform").</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02083"><b>2</b> <i>The Commons disagreed to the above Amendment because it would unduly restrict the circumstances in which a constable might exercise his powers</i>.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02084"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that this House doth not insist on their Amendment numbered 1, to which the Commons have disagreed for the Reason numbered 2.<lb/>
When this Bill came to your Lordships' House from another place it was received by a number of your Lordships with a good deal of suspicion. This was because a number of your Lordships believed that it gave new powers to the police, that these powers affected the civil liberties of individuals towards whom they might use those powers, and that the safeguards which the Bill provided for those liberties were not adequate to balance them.<lb/>
The whole of our lengthy and painstaking treatment of the Bill has turned again and again upon this question of balance&#x2014;the balance between, on the one hand, the power of the police to protect the public from criminals, and, on the other, the need for the law to protect the fundamental liberties of those the police suspect of being criminals.<lb/>
The first debate on that central issue emerged on the first day, on this amendment of the first clause. The clause, as it came to us from another place, proposed a power for any police constable who had reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person or a vehicle was carrying stolen property, or articles intended for use in the process of acquiring other people's property by illegal means, or offensive weapons, to stop them and search them for these things. This was a power short of arrest which had been available to a number of police forces for a long time and which recent Scottish
<col>462</col>
experience had proved to be beneficial in the fight against crime.<lb/>
Nonetheless, your Lordships were suspicious of it. Noble Lords opposite were suspicious of it on the general grounds I have already mentioned and they sought to limit it beyond the limitations as to place and circumstance already in the Bill. Those limitations included the requirement that before he began the search the constable should identify himself with his name and the name of his police station; that he should tell the suspect what he was looking for and why he was looking for it; that he should inform him that a written record would be available to him, on request, of the object and grounds for the search; of the date, time and place of the search; of what, if anything, was found by the search; of any injury or damage resulting from the search; and, of course, of the identity of the person carrying out the search. The Bill also prevented a constable, in conducting a search, from requiring a person to remove more than his outer coat or gloves.<lb/>
The safeguards written into the Bill included everything recommended by the Philips Royal Commission, and more besides. Those fairly substantial safeguards were not enough to settle your Lordships' anxiety, and after 14 columns worth of debate your Lordships persuaded the House to limit the power further and substantially. This was done by an amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, evidently very persuasively, to the effect that the power should not be given to every police constable but only to police constables in uniform.<lb/>
That amendment was passed against the strong advice both of the Government and of the Philips Royal Commission, whose opinions on other matters noble Lords opposite regarded as being more sacrosanct. It would be fruitless for me to wheel out again all the arguments I fired off at this amendment at Committee stage. Suffice it to say that the amendment took from the police a power which both we and they believed to be of great importance to law enforcement and without which both off-duty men and policemen on duty in plain clothes must either arrest a suspect or let him go unchallenged. This has serious implications for essential planned operations such as those against shoplifting, which in some places is very serious indeed. It also means that no beat policeman can search someone he meets unexpectedly and while he is not on duty, who he believes may be on the way from a burglary, if he is not wearing his uniform, unless he first arrests him and enters upon the procedures which the Bill already lays upon him for an arrest. Noble Lords, it seems, felt that they would rather the innocent suspect was arrested, and presumably taken to the police station, than have his innocence quickly demonstrated on the street.<lb/>
Noble Lords were not reassured by the requirements already in the Bill that a constable not in uniform must produce documentary proof that he is a constable before he embarked on a search; nor were they impressed that exercise of this power in the past had not produced the general disquiet they now told us to expect. We had argued that the balance between suspect and police was evenly struck. It was very much a question of balance, and in the end your Lordships
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0240"/>
<col>463</col>
decided against the Bill, the Government and Philips, and in favour of the noble and learned Lord's amendment, and did so by two votes; so the balance in that case was very nearly even.<lb/>
The practical and operational arguments against taking that course are the same today as they were on 25th October, and if I were to advance them again in the same circumstances, we ought, other things being equal, to get the same result. But other things are not equal. Two things have changed; both of them are very relevant, and I ask your Lordships to give due and considerable weight to them. The first is that we have since agreed to subject the whole of the stop and search provisions of the Bill to the operation of a code of conduct. Breach of that code will be a disciplinary offence which the courts are empowered to consider in any case involving the search. That code has been published in draft. It is available to your Lordships and I think your Lordships will agree that it does add significant weight to the safeguards of individual rights embodied in the Bill.<lb/>
Indeed, the view of noble Lords opposite may now already be that of the leading article in Thursday's <i>Guardian</i> newspaper&#x2014;a paper which I understand is very much read by noble Lords opposite. That paper says:
<quote>"Accepting the Lords' amendment would mean accepting that a plain clothes police officer, on duty to prevent and detect crime, must ignore deeply suspicious behaviour. That would not reduce crime. Stop and search creates apprehension because it is open to police abuse. Mindful of that, the Government has introduced a stop and search code. It is the strength and rigorous enforcement of that, rather than the Elwyn-Jones amendment, which will best serve the twin interests of justice and civil liberty".</quote>
On those grounds alone I believe that the voting balance, so narrowly tilted one way, can now fairly be tilted the other. But it is not the only change in circumstances. There has been another. The other is that the elected House of Parliament, having considered that balance, and having taken note of that additional safeguard, has come down on the side of the Bill as drafted and against the amendment.<lb/>
I believe that the proper thing for your Lordships now to do is not to insist on your Lordships' amendment. The arguments against it when it was first moved were such as to give only the narrowest majority for it. It was agreed on the grounds that the safeguards in the Bill were inadequate&#x2014;they have since been reinforced. It is the decided opinion of another place that in these new circumstances the amendment is no longer merited. I respectfully suggest that your Lordships might now agree with them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02085">Moved, That this House doth not insist on their Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have disagreed for the Reason numbered 2.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Elton</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02086"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in spite of the persuasiveness&#x2014;if I may return the compliment&#x2014;of the noble Minister, I invite the House to insist on your Lordships' amendment which was carried, albeit by a small majority, as the noble Lord has said, but with support from all quarters of the House. Indeed, that was quite a remarkable feature of the debate.<lb/>
This is an important amendment which, of course, is why we are endeavouring to insist upon it. As the
<col>464</col>
noble Lord has indicated, it arises from Clause 1 (2) of the Bill. Whereas subsection (1) of that clause, giving powers to the police, states that it may be exercised only by "a constable in uniform", subsection (2) gives the power of stop and search to a constable <i>simpliciter</i> and that means that he need not be in uniform when he stops a member of the public and searches him or any vehicle at any time of the day or night in any public place&#x2014;or other places as well&#x2014;anywhere in England and in Wales if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he will find stolen or prohibited articles. "Prohibited articles" are defined to include offensive weapons and of course any article in the possession of an offensive person can easily be construed as an offensive weapon. But that is the mischief that is sought to be exposed and attacked.<lb/>
We on this side of the House are not challenging the need for the police force to have the power of stop and search. What we are challenging is their power to do so in plain clothes&#x2014;that is the sole and crucial issue that arises on this amendment. The value of stop and search powers in terms of protecting the community is in any case very small. Yet if the Bill as it now stands receives Royal Assent and if the practice in London&#x2014;where there are a million stops and searches in a year&#x2014;is extended throughout the country, it may well mean that 7 million or 8 million of our fellow citizens may be stopped or searched on the streets in many circumstances and on many occasions by plain clothes constables. The huge majority of that vast number of our fellow citizens will be innocent. They will have done nothing wrong and will have no cause to be stopped or searched. Unfortunately, a disproportionate number of those will be youths and particularly members of the ethnic minority. I think it is significant that a recent report of the Policy Studies Institute on the metropolitan police indicates that only 3 per cent. of the stops and searches carried out by the police resulted in arrests&#x2014;three out of 100. We do not know in how many of that limited number of cases there were subsequent charges or how many charges resulted in conviction.<lb/>
To be stopped and searched even by a police constable in uniform is not an experience to which the public take kindly especially&#x2014;as will be the case with most of them&#x2014;when they are innocent. I submit that they will take even less kindly to being stopped and searched by someone of whose credentials when they are stopped they are not sure.<lb/>
The matter was put with great force by the noble Baroness, Lady Macleod, when she spoke in our debate on 26th June. Incidentally, we hope that she will be back among us again soon. I do not think that the noble Baroness will mind if I quote her. She said:
<quote>"I am only a common citizen who might be stopped. I would prefer to be stopped by an officer in uniform. An officer in uniform carries more weight and much more authority &#x2026; I am thinking specifically of the young. They need to have confidence in the people who might in the future stop and search them. It is important that the young person involved should be able to see the [constable's] number and know, because of the uniform, that there was a perfect right to stop and search them. That is followed by confidence, and in turn will be followed by communication between the two. That will do both sides a very great deal of good."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26/6/84; col. 794.]</quote>
With that I respectfully agree, and in a way it goes to the heart of what we have to decide this evening.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0241"/>
<col>465</col>
The Minister has properly and not surprisingly relied on the safeguards which exist in Clause 2 of the Bill and which he has described. But while those safeguards are good as far as they go, the difficulty will be that the constable has quickly and immediately to convey the information set out in that rather elaborate clause, and the danger is that the communicated information will come too late. The critical point which we are dealing with in the circumstances which could arise concerns the first minutes, or seconds even, after the stop and the attempted search. The probable reaction in many cases would be resistance or an attempt to escape, followed by a chase and then other succeeding charges.<lb/>
We do not think that the safeguards will create certainty in the mind of the person stopped or searched that the person seeking to stop him and search him is indeed lawfully entitled as a member of the police force to do so. At the end of the day the important question as we see it is this: will giving the power to stop and search to plain clothes police constables enhance the police service, or will it be liable to increase the friction between the general public and the police? The ordinary citizen if approached by a constable in uniform has the natural reaction to co-operate with the police, but approached by someone not in uniform the reaction may well be very different.<lb/>
If the police are to succeed in combating crime&#x2014;and it is very important that they should do so for they are and should be in the front line of the action against crime&#x2014;they must retain the public confidence. That is an absolute necessity in the struggle against increasing crime, and alas that is not happening. Giving power to the police in plain clothes dressed like any ordinary citizen, or perhaps even in some curious so-called ordinary clothing, to stop and search a citizen in the street, maybe at night in a secluded place, will be liable not to increase confidence in the police force but rather to diminish it. I beg to move the insistence on the amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02089">4.31 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02090"><member>Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall not delay the House for long. Up until now I have had the powerful support of two noble friends, one Liberal and one SDP, who are prominent criminal lawyers, and in speaking as a layman one must be very careful. There are two serious dangers here, one on each side. One of the dangers has been well described by the noble and learned Lord. It is the growing distrust of the police&#x2014;and it is still growing in certain areas&#x2014;felt by
<col>466</col>
in particular youth and ethnic youth. The second evil is the feeling of the police that without these powers they cannot do their proper job.<lb/>
These are two important points, and it is difficult to decide quickly between them. The issue is much narrower than one at first thinks. The PSI figures, which the noble and learned Lord quoted, show that out of a million stops and searches in the metropolitan area, only 5 per cent. were done by policemen in plain clothes. Therefore, whereas we are talking in general in regard to this clause about a million stops and searches in the metropolitan area, we are talking in this case of only 5 per cent. of that.<lb/>
If you are stopped by a man who is obviously a policeman, you will not react violently unless you know he has got you and you are wrong anyway. But if you are stopped by somebody who is not obviously a policeman, and if you come from the world where you strike somebody very early in an argument&#x2014;and these people live in that world, make no mistake about it&#x2014;you are liable to strike a plainclothes man and then be had up for resisting the police.<lb/>
I cannot quote figures, but there are many cases where this has happened, where the person has got into trouble not through refusing to be searched by a policeman, but through having an argument with somebody he thinks, or likes to think, is not a policeman. It is a difficult decision. I am advising my noble friends on these Benches to vote the way we voted last time and support the noble and learned Lord, but I think that it is a narrow decision.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02091"><member>The Earl of Dudley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may say one word, because I feel so strongly on the subject. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, referred to the young. I have a number of young children. We have in our midst a terrible affliction which threatens our young every day, and that is drugs. I can visualise circumstances in which it might be necessary for the fight against drugs to be undertaken by a policeman in plain clothes. It might be necessary for policemen in plain clothes to stop and search people for drugs. This seems to me to be so important that I cannot visualise that it would be right to remove this option from our police.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02092"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I briefly intervene on that point? I think I am right in saying that the drugs legislation expressly gives the police those powers in or out of uniform.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02093"><member>Lord Inglewood</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say a few sentences in support of the Government. We ought not to read too much into some of the theoretical arguments which we have heard deployed in this House. We have to remember that individual policemen will be out alone, often late at night, and through the small things they may see and think unreasonable, they can be on the way to discovering quite considerable crime.<lb/>
This power is practical, so far as I can see, but it is not sinister. It is used, by tradition, in certain districts more than in others. Like many police powers, it can be abused, but where powers are abused it is the business of the supervisory grades to be sure that that
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0242"/>
<col>467</col>
abuse is in fact corrected. A discreet and correct use of this power may greatly help with the normal routine duties that fall the way of every constable and stolen property is frequently recovered as a result. It is best for us to delete the words "in uniform" so that this wider power remains in the hands of the individual policemen who will proceed and who, under the proper supervision of their seniors, will be doing a most important job on the streets of the cities of this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02094"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, promise to be brief, and I shall keep my promise. In the course of his remarks to the House in support of the views expressed by another place, the noble Lord the Minister said that certain factors had supervened since the debate in your Lordships' House. With great respect, I must tell him that I have read with the greatest of care the debate which took place elsewhere, and there is no question at all but that precisely the same arguments and considerations that came before your Lordships came before that place and no additional factors were there in that argument whatsoever.<lb/>
To say, for example, that there is a code of practice and that that code of practice now forms part of a Bill does not affect in any way the matter that your Lordships have to decide today, and have decided on a previous occasion. To be practical for one moment, one can well imagine that if any police officer&#x2014;and I admit that this is true both in uniform and without uniform&#x2014;says against a person who has no witness whatsoever that he gave all the particulars and said all the things that he ought to have said, and there is merely a citizen complainant who will put his word against that of a police officer, it will be extremely difficult for any disciplinary board, however fair it may want to be, to find against the police officer concerned.<lb/>
There is one central issue in this matter. My noble and learned friend put it with his usual clarity and, as the noble Lord the Minister said, persuasiveness. He was right in this point. It is that the one essential thing that we have been trying to safeguard throughout our consideration of this Bill is the relationship of the police with the community. To give the power to a police officer not in uniform, be it in the open street late at night when nobody else is there, or be it in some alleyway, to come up in plain clothes and to say "I am going to stop and search you", is to invite trouble of a completely honest kind so far as any of our citizens is concerned. Does one really imagine that, without adequate lighting and in the agony, as it may be, of that moment, every citizen will be able to say, "Yes, thank you very much. I will put my glasses on, I will inspect your identity card as a police officer. I have noted the number you have been kind enough to give me and now let us proceed with the whole affair"?<lb/>
Life is not like that. What will happen is that on a number of occasions there will be resistance because the citizen concerned will not know whether he has been properly stopped. That is something that will never occur with a uniformed officer.<lb/>
There can be as much debate as your Lordships like in another place or in this place. That was the central issue we debated last time: that is the central issue now. When we start talking in terms of certainty on
<col>468</col>
one side or the other, I find myself in so much agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson. It was a difficult decision to take, but we took it. Reference was made to the Royal Commission. One member of the Royal Commission recommended that indeed it should be only officers in uniform.<lb/>
When your Lordships debated this matter I can remember so well the words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, who is not known these days for disagreeing with the Government. Upon that occasion he definitely said that he was swayed one way and then the other and did not quite know where to land. That, with the brain of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, is saying to your Lordships that we should be very careful before we disagree with that we decided on a previous occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02095"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, briefly may I support the Government on this? I suggest that it would be wrong to insist on this Lords' amendment. I respectfully question the assertion that power to stop and search under Clause 1 is of scant value. It obtains for places to which the public has access; this, without exercising the power of detention under Clause 2, both powers under both clauses are requisite. One example of the planned type of operation might be drugs, on which my noble friend has already spoken. Another might be using places for prostitution of the very young. There are such places to which the public has access in London.<lb/>
A watch has to be kept by a plain clothes officer, for obvious reasons. By the time a police officer in uniform has arrived the suspect one would have wished to search may have left in a vehicle which one would also have wished to search. That is a reasonable situation. It would be wrong, in the overall interest of justice, to tip the balance too far against the police in their protection of the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02096"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the number of things which noble Lords opposite have said with which I agree is remarkable in this respect&#x2014;that it is so different from the number of conclusions which they have reached therefrom with which I agree.<lb/>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, was right to say that there was support from parts of this House other than the part in which he sits. To that, I can only say that I address my arguments with the greatest of fervour to those who have strayed furthest into the lobby in which he voted on that occasion. He was wrong if it was his intention to imply that the description of an officer as a constable <i>simpliciter</i> in Clause 2 in any way reduces the limitations imposed by this amendment to Clause 1, upon which it depends. But he did not make much of that and nor shall I. He was right to say that those who are stopped by plain clothes policemen will, in many cases, be absolutely innocent. I wonder why therefore he insists that arrest shall be the only means of establishing that innocence in future. He is right to say that the numbers of searches are large. That is why substantial cautionary words are in Section IB of the code of practice.<lb/>
He and the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, were both right to say that these stops and searches easily can and often have had a bad effect on the confidence of the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0243"/>
<col>469</col>
people searched. That is why we have in the code&#x2014;I will read the briefest excerpt&#x2014;that,
<quote>"It is &#x2026; important to ensure that the powers are used responsibly and sparingly. Over use of the powers is as likely to be harmful to police effort in the long term as misuse. It is also particularly important to ensure that any person searched must be treated courteously and considerately"&#x2014;</quote>
and not in a manner that can be mistaken as an assault in a back alley&#x2014;
<quote>"if police action is not to be resented".</quote>
The whole of this code will guide and inform the supervisory grades, who, my noble friend Lord Inglewood rightly reminded us, will be seeing that the junior ranks behave themselves as they should in carrying out these operations.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Dudley, rightly highlighted the importance of drugs. To the extent that these items can be searched for by constables under another Act of Parliament, this amendment is an anomaly and superfluous. But shoplifters do not usually steal drugs: muggers do not use drugs as offensive weapons against their victims: burglars do not use drugs to open other people's windows, and these are the matters that we are concerned with.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, was right to say that there was one dissentient voice on the Philips Commission, but I think he might have mentioned that there were 15 other voices altogether who agreed.<lb/>
I come in conclusion, because your Lordships wish to conclude this matter, to the question of public confidence to which the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon&#x2014;persuasively as always&#x2014;rightly drew your Lordships' attention. We believe that public confidence in the police is essential in a free society. We do not believe that the public can maintain confidence in a police force to which Parliament denies rights to carry out their essential functions in uniform or out. We believe that those who are stopped and searched, now that the code is in existence, will be less numerous and far less alarmed than they have been in the past. We believe that the powers we ask your Lordships to leave in this Bill are essential to good order, safety and public confidence in the police service.</membercontribution></p>

The difficulty is one which was spotted only at the last moment. If your Lordships wish, I will expand on what I now say after noble Lords have shown that they wish me so to do.<lb/>
But your Lordships may be contented if I merely say that an accidental result of the way in which the Bill was drafted when it left us was that constables who are members of non-Home Office police forces were prevented from taking suspects to their own police stations when those stations were within the area served by a Home Office police station always. The intention and the effect of these amendments is to remove that anomaly so that people like the British Rail police can still handle offenders and suspects in the way that they have done without, of course, escaping the provisions of the custody officer and so on which are required if there is an arrest for a serious arrestable offence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02137">(2) <i>Nothing in this section shall prejudice any rule of law requiring a court to exclude evidence. ")</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02138"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the House doth not insist on their amendment numbered 8, to which the Commons have disagreed, and doth agree with the Commons in their amendment numbered 9 in lieu thereof. At the Report stage of our proceedings on this Bill your Lordships decided to insert a new clause after what was then Clause 71. The scheme of the new clause, which was moved by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, is that a court shall not allow evidence to be given unless certain requirements are met. Once it is plausibly suggested to the court that evidence may have been obtained improperly, the court has no choice under the new clause but to apply the tests set out in the subsections.<lb/>
It is, I think, both clear and generally agreed that this provision will result in a significant increase in the numbers of trials within trials, and that they will be long and complex. But that does not seem to us to bring any benefit to the process of justice. This is one of the considerations which has led the Government to dislike the new clause.<lb/>
That is not to say that the court should never hold such a trial within a trial; nor is it to say that the court should not have a discretion to exclude unfairly obtained evidence if the admission of it would render the proceedings unfair. Nor, indeed, is it to say that the discretionary power should not be written into the statute book. In all this we are on common ground with the noble and learned Lord and his supporters, and that is why, in a moment, I shall be asking your Lordships to agree with an alternative amendment which gives this discretion to the court. I must, I think, say what are the other reasons we have for disliking what the noble and learned Lord proposed, and your Lordships agreed, and for seeking an acceptable alternative, but I shall do so only briefly because we are on familiar ground.<lb/>
Much has been made, especially in another place, of the clarity and precision of the drafting of the new clause. The court would know what to do, it was suggested in another place, because Parliament would have told it what to do. As a layman, I found myself a little surprised sitting there in the Gallery. I recalled the seven tests in the clause, and I also recalled the very trenchant things said about them by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. I should reassure those of your Lordships who feel that you have come to a play in which the understudy is in a principal role, by saying that my noble and learned friend will reply to your Lordships' remarks.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0246"/>
<col>475</col>
But my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, who is about as far from being a layman as it is possible to be, pointed out that the amendment as drafted invited the court to accept a different and apparently lower standard of proof in cases involving a very grave offence from those involving trivial ones. He asked whether that was the intention of sub-section (1)(<i>c</i>). He asked what sort of significance the court was to take as being "material significance" in the subsection before it. He asked what standard of certainty was required by the words,
<quote>"If it appears to the court&#x2026; that any evidence &#x2026; may have been obtained improperly",</quote>
with which words the whole process of testing is initiated.<lb/>
All these seemed to me, as a layman, very pertinent questions. They are open questions, and they are questions which a court must answer before it is able to obey the direction laid on it by this clause. The fact that they are questions at all&#x2014;and my right honourable friend asked them in much the same terms in another place&#x2014;makes it clear that the court is invited to make a series of value judgments about matters on which the clause cannot be precise at all. They must remain in doubt, and doubt seems to arise in this clause more readily than one might wish of anything we put on the statute book.<lb/>
But of one thing I think there is no doubt. All of your Lordships, I believe, wish to see justice done, and done fairly. We want to see the guilty fairly convicted and the innocent fairly acquitted. What we do not want to see is the guilty being unfairly acquitted. Yet as my right honourable friend the Home Secretary pointed out in another place, the new clause could lead to the acquittal of a guilty man, not because of a confession that has been wrung from him by oppression, nor as the result merely of a fair trial, but simply because evidence has been obtained in breach of the law or of the codes of practice.<lb/>
Many noble Lords who supported this new clause did so, I believe, because they wished to prevent misconduct by the police. I will not now recite yet again the impressive battery of safeguards against such misconduct that we have already erected both in the Bill and in the codes of practice, because your Lordships know them all too well. The point I now wish to make is that if misconduct nevertheless does occur, then the effect of the clause is to punish not the police, but the public. Punishment is exacted from the public by turning the guilty, and perhaps dangerous, man loose among them. That does not seem to us what your Lordships would, on reflection, wish to do.<lb/>
I will not dwell longer on our objections to this new clause. They were put cogently on the record by my noble and learned friend for all to read at the last stage here. But while we discussed that amendment, my noble and learned friend had another on the Marshalled List. His proposal was to give the judges a discretion to exclude unfairly obtained evidence, and to make the basis of that exclusion the fact that not to exclude it would upset the fairness of the trial. That amendment remained on the Marshalled List here and the noble and learned Lord's amendment went, on a majority of seven votes, with the Bill and down the corridor to another place. In another place, it was
<col>476</col>
rather less successful and the elected House of Parliament decided against it. That, I submit to your Lordships, would alter the case even if we now offered your Lordships an amendment in exactly the terms of that which was on the Marshalled List at Report, but that is not what I propose we should do.<lb/>
In discussion at an earlier stage the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, brought two points home to us with considerable force. He reminded us that the term "prejudicial", which we had used to describe the effects of evidence which might cause it to be excluded, had been invested by the courts with a much stronger meaning than was appropriate in the context, and we have removed it, thus considerably altering the impact of our proposed new clause. He also pointed out that, in all fairness, what we proposed to do for evidence gained from the accused ought to be done for evidence gained from any other person. Again, we were persuaded, and we have changed the amendment accordingly.<lb/>
The amendment as drafted gives the court discretion in criminal proceedings to refuse to allow any prosecution evidence to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it. It simply allows the court to exclude evidence if the fairness of the proceedings would be adversely affected, and explicitly requires the way in which the evidence was obtained to be addressed in any such decision.<lb/>
In enlarging the effects of the clause in response to the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman, we have taken the opportunity to embrace evidence given in a confession. Our amendment is therefore intended to provide a framework for considering the fairness of admitting all forms of evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely in any case brought before the courts.<lb/>
We believe that this amendment will achieve the fairness that all want to see established: fairness to the accused, because decisions on admissibility of evidence against him should not depend, for example, on the charge he faces; fairness to the public, because evidence will not be excluded purely for some reason lying outside the question of the guilt or innocence of the accused; and fairness to the court, because the number of disputes over the admissibility of evidence will be reduced by this amendment, so it can devote itself effectively and efficiently to its proper function&#x2014;providing a fair trial for the accused.<lb/>
I believe that this amendment is preferable to the present clause. The underlying principle is there, but our proposal will also simplify procedures on the exclusion of evidence; will reject evidence whose use is unfair for whatever reason; and will include all relevant and good evidence in the best interests of justice&#x2014;and that means in the best interests of us all. My Lords, I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02140"><member>Lord Scarman</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as the one who moved the amendment which found favour with your Lordships' House, I think I owe it to the House to indicate at once my position upon the Message from another place. I confess that the longer I listened to the delicate shafts directed by the noble Lord the Minister towards what I would impertinently call "my amendment" the more I became determined to change my mind and have a fight for the original amendment. I have resisted that temptation. I do so not because I share the noble Lord's dislike of your Lordships' amendment. I still think that it has great virtues and that it is preferable to that which has emerged from another place. I do so for two reasons. First, I see the virtues and qualities in the amendment which has come from another place. I believe that it has absorbed those virtues and qualities from a certain ministerial study of your Lordships' amendment. It is certainly an amendment which will provide the judges with a useful exclusionary rule where it is right and proper that evidence should be excluded, by which I mean where improperly obtained evidence should be excluded.<lb/>
Secondly, bearing in mind what has been achieved in another place&#x2014;largely, I suspect, due to the imaginative and determined work of this House&#x2014;I suggest that this is not an issue upon which we should enter into an argument with the elected House of Parliament. I attach great importance to the constitutional argument. Questions of principle will arise in which the constitutional argument cannot be allowed to prevail; but when the question is, as here, a choice between two proposals, each of them having merit, the fact that I may happen to think your Lordships' proposal has greater merit than that from the other House is no reason for rejecting the other House's view, they being the elected House, if there is quality in their proposal, too. I should not advise the House to insist upon the House's amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02141"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am perfectly sure that the House would always want to follow the guidance of the noble and learned Lord, to which we have just listened. I therefore rise merely in order that the record should be clear. My noble and learned friend Lord Elwyn-Jones and I&#x2014;I add my own name with all due humility&#x2014;have studied both amendments and have listened to the arguments about the limitation of the amendment coming from another place relating to the case within a case and we do not have the slightest doubt but that the amendment which is now before the House for acceptance will widen the area of debate, argument and dispute.<lb/>
The original amendment of the noble and learned Lord laid down very clear guidelines upon which the court could act. We now have an amendment under which all the circumstances in which the evidence is obtained&#x2014;broad terms, general terms&#x2014;can be taken into account by the court. In those circumstances, one can imagine every advocate appearing for a defendant thinking that he has not done his duty if he has not asked the court to explore every single avenue relating both to impropriety and to the grounds of admissibility or non-admissibility. That is because the amendment which we are now considering is in such general and vague terms.<lb/>
<col>478</col>
As I have already mentioned, I put this on record as the view which my noble and learned friend and I take about this amendment by way of tribute to the original amendment which was passed by your Lordships. However, in view of what the noble and learned Lord has said about what he rightly called his amendment, I have nothing further to add.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02142"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I be permitted merely to add a tribute to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scarman?

Before I sit down, may I also pay tribute to the noble and learned Lord for his initiation of the important amendment regarding racial discrimination and express our pleasure that the Government thought it right yesterday to support the decision of your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Airline Competition Policy</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02146">5.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02147"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member> rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will make a further statement on the White Paper <i>Airline Competition Policy</i> (Cmnd. 9366) prior to any debate in Parliament.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02148">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in rising to ask the Question which stands in my name on the Order Paper today, perhaps I may remind the House that just before we rose for the Summer Recess we were indebted to the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, for initiating a debate on the report of the Civil Aviation Authority which had been requested by the Government. Unfortunately, the noble Earl, Lord Kinnoull, is abroad on Parliamentary business. We all regret his absence today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02149">Since that debate, we have had the response of the Government to the report of the Civil Aviation Authority. Some of the decisions and judgments many people find puzzling. I have tried to word my question accordingly. Before there is any general debate in Parliament I, for one, should like to raise several points which I find, shall we say, peculiar. Following our discussion tonight, it may be that we shall better be able to discuss in full parliamentary debate the issues and judgments inevitably called into question. I am most grateful to those who are to take part in the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0248"/>
<col>479</col>
debate. It is quite obvious to anybody who knows anything about aviation that we are very fortunate in the speakers we are to hear tonight. They have a depth of experience which certainly could not be exceeded in another place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02150">The reasons why I have raised the matter as soon as possible are these. I was unhappy and disturbed by the White Paper on <i>Airline Competition Policy</i> published by the Government in reply to the report of the Civil Aviation Authority. To begin with, I was most concerned about the antagonism which surfaced in the period preceding the Government's decision, even allowing for the importance of the issues involved. This antagonism of course was not the fault of the Government: but for those of us, in this House and outside, who were deeply interested but not wishing to take sides with one airline against another and who saw the problem as greater than the attitude of any individual airline, it was a most disagreeable factor.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02151">What has worried me throughout and what, I suggest, has worried many people has been the question of the airline industry itself. My major concern is that the Government have failed to grasp this opportunity to deal with the obvious imbalance in the United Kingdom aviation market. A restructuring could have brought in a new era for the industry lasting into the next century, and it seems unlikely that such an opportunity will recur for many years to come.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02152">A second reason for concern is that the many complex questions and problems affecting the airline industry should not be dealt with piecemeal, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, but considered as a whole. This would have been possible by a general restructuring.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02153">Take, for instance, the following examples&#x2014;all of which are pending. There is the inspector's report on the Stansted/Heathrow issue for a third London Airport: the report of the Select Committee on transport dealing with the organisation, financing and control of airports in the United Kingdom; the consultation document on air transport movements at Heathrow Airport. To these must be added, I suppose, privatisation of the British Airports Authority and its airports.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02154">My third major concern arises from my belief that the Government have erred in the weight they have given to Treasury opinion. I want to ask whether it really is for the good of the industry, the airlines and the passengers that all such considerations should be submerged under Treasury demands for the privatisation of British Airways in the spring of next year. Would it not have been better for all concerned&#x2014;and perhaps even of long-term benefit to the Treasury itself&#x2014;if these matters had been considered and dealt with as a whole, deferring any privatisation date for British Airways until this had been done?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02155">The response of the Government in the White Paper is to state in their first two paragraphs, paragraphs 14 and 15, that:
<quote>"Uncertainties affecting the privatisation of British Airways must be resolved. The Government has decided that there will be no forced reduction in British Airways' size relative to the rest of the industry".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02156">But is this the right decision? However fair and scrupulous British Airways may be in its dealings,
<col>480</col>
there can be no doubt that its high share of the airline market&#x2014;namely, 65 per cent. of total United Kingdom airline output and 81 per cent. of output on scheduled services&#x2014;presents a considerable imbalance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02157">In paragraph 15 the Government state:
<quote>"The independents have grown despite British Airways and should continue to be able to grow, given fair competition, provided sufficient opportunities are available to them and provided they have the resources to take advantage of these opportunities".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02158">This same paragraph admits the imbalance in its last sentence, when it states:
<quote>"If these conditions can be met, the independents will be able to grow so as to reduce further the imbalance in the industry".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02159">These are, of course, impeccable statements, or even judgments, but the imbalance is hereby admitted. There remains the crucial question: have we got these essential sufficient opportunities?</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02160">I, for one, have always recognised and agreed that British Airways must remain our dominant and major airline. But I confess that I find myself disturbed by the comments of Mr. Neil Forster, chairman of Air UK, that this White Paper had entirely confirmed a privatised British Airways in its overwhelmingly powerful position in the United Kingdom aviation scene. I am afraid that I accept that point of view.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02161">If we are correct in this feeling, it means that we are to be faced with the prospect of the transition of a near public monopoly into a private monopoly. I myself regard any privatisation of British Airways in a purely pragmatic sense&#x2014;in other words, what is best for all concerned, but not the transition of one type of monopoly into another.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02162">At least I was heartened that the Government commit themselves to the principle of dual designation of many routes, but these rights (if that be the correct word) have to be negotiated with foreign governments, and that is a very different story. In the past foreign governments have been most uncooperative in granting rights to a second British airline. The noble Lord the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe I am correct in saying that BCal has licences to fly in competition with British Airways to Vienna, Milan and Helsinki but cannot do so because the countries concerned refuse to accept the dual designation principle.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02163">There are other examples, as the Government know. Is it not true that the West German Government have blocked similar rights to Cologne, Hamburg, Hanover and Stuttgart, even though the Civil Aviation Authority has granted BCal the United Kingdom licences? Let us not run away with the idea that dual designation is an immediate panacea.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02164">The House knows my views on Gatwick. Paragraph 17 of the White Paper mentions the development of Gatwick as a major centre of international operations. Certainly there is the space at Gatwick for this. For myself, I do not believe that Gatwick can be developed to its full potential without a second runway. I was glad to note that I was supported in this belief by the Civil Aviation Authority, when one of its senior figures stated in September that Gatwick must choose between a second runway or failing to reach its projected growth target. Of course, support from the Civil Aviation Authority may not count for much with the Government today, but many of us believe that the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0249"/>
<col>481</col>
authority is both experienced and well informed, and that its professional opinions are less prejudiced than many others.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02165">What seems to me to be so utterly wrong (and it is why I keep on about this) is that decisions of this nature&#x2014;a second runway&#x2014;are taken not on the merits of the matter, but on the underground politics concerning Stansted and political considerations of voters around Gatwick, rather than on the future of the airport itself. It is so much wasted breath to talk about developing Gatwick as a hub-and-spoke airport of the future and to deny what is obviously necessary. Also, it is dishonest.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02166">I have in my hands a copy of <i>Airport News</i> (the journal of the British Airports Authority) for 22nd October. The banner headline across the top of the front page reads, "Don't stifle success". The opening paragraph states:
<quote>"Any move to stifle the development of London's airports could jeopardise the successful privatisation of British Airways and put at risk the future of independent carriers like British Caledonian, BAA chairman Norman Payne told a meeting of Conservative MPs during their conference at Brighton".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02167">Mr. Payne went on to say:
<quote>"Heathrow is already close to the ceiling of 275,000 movements due to be imposed by the Government next year and the Government has recently confirmed that Gatwick will remain a single runway airport, so there will be a capacity problem ahead".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02168">I would ask your Lordships to note those words:
<quote>"Gatwick will remain a single runway airport, so there will be a capacity problem ahead".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02169">Arising from this refusal to look at the future of Gatwick and this inability to develop its full potential is the question of what is to be the future position of European charters. This is a highly efficient sector of British air transport to which I paid tribute in our debate of 30th July. We were then discussing the report of the Civil Aviation Authority which, in its paragraph 12, spoke of the substantial demand for charter seats which was being satisfied from Gatwick. Furthermore, it went on to say that to rule that charters should increasingly be operated from some other airport was,
<quote>"to substitute the planner's judgment for the proper working of the market place".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02170">It strengthened this point in paragraph 18 when it stated:
<quote>"The aim of Gatwick must be the development of a strong and sustainable network of scheduled services such as the Government and this Authority has striven to build and sustain over many years. If the price of developing the scheduled service network at Gatwick was progressively to squeeze charters out, this would be to render a major disservice to a substantial category of public demand".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02171">Under present proposals in the White Paper, this is what I believe will happen. I think that the charters will indeed be squeezed out.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02172">I wonder how many people read the letter in <i>The Times</i> on 31st August from Mr. Davison, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Britannia Airways, saying that in this year, 1984, some 8 million holiday makers would benefit from the low costs and high standards offered by charter flights. I think that I would be prepared to accept the point made by Mr. Davison that this social revolution by which ordinary people have benefited over the past 20 years would not have occurred under a one-airline policy, or even under a two-airline policy. The charter business
<col>482</col>
believes it happened because of intense competition in the private sector in a truly competitive market place.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02173">Moving on to the problem of the regional airports, exemplified by Birmingham and Manchester, it must be obvious to all that this is difficult to solve on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Surely, and obviously, so much must depend on the decision relating to London's third airport. Are we to see Birmingham and Manchester emerge as more than what has been called tertiary international airports? In other words, might we have not a third London airport but one in the North? This is a further illustration of the Government's error in not embarking on major reconstruction embracing the many problems involved.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02174">The point should be made that the proposals from the Civil Aviation Authority had Manchester very much in mind. In a letter to <i>The Times</i> on 28th August, Mr. Ray Colegate of the CAA stated that Manchester was an excellently run airport and a major hub which should be developed. The proposals of the CAA were intended to give the smaller operators the opportunity to develop their own European services at major provincial airports in competition with London. I think that few well-informed people would disagree with the fact that many of these routes are too thin to accommodate three airlines; that is, two British and one foreign.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02175">As ever, tributes are paid to the consumer by the Government. The consumer is always in favour until he either wants something or attempts to remedy what he sees as an injustice to the consumer. Nobody knows that better than I do. So, in the White Paper a refusal to deal with the admitted imbalance in the airline industry is said to be of benefit to the consumer.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02176">Concerning the role suggested for the Office of Fair Trading, we shall have to wait for the Government to lay the necessary statutory instruments before Parliament. Although I have the strongest admiration for the Office of Fair Trading and for its Director-General, Sir Gordon Borrie, I do not think that this is the way to deal with these problems. To begin with, cases can take a long time, inquiries can take longer still, while predatory pricing is most difficult to define. How does one distinguish between a predatory price and a tough business one? That would keep the lawyers occupied for years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02177">I have found all this tonight difficult. Probably others have, too. There has been a great deal of personal antagonism, as I said at the beginning of my speech, and it is not easy to avoid taking sides. We all know the old maxim that he who stands in the middle of the road gets run down. Well, on this aspect I shall just have to be run down. But making no commendations seems unappreciative&#x2014;as though one did not realise all the effort put in by the industry. I do, indeed, appreciate the superhuman effort made by British Airways in pulling itself round; the superhuman effort made by British Caledonian which, over the last eight years, lost money in only one year; the superhuman effort made by the charter sector which accounts for 33 per cent. of all passenger miles flown by the independent airlines and British Airways put together.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02178">Obviously, it is not possible to deal with all the points in the White Paper. Most of us still need time to reflect on what is suggested, and the outcome. But during the past waiting period, as we know from our
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0250"/>
<col>483</col>
own debates, different accountants, different airlines, different media all had different answers and interpretations to what were apparently the same facts and figures.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02179">I submit that it is not for us to take sides&#x2014;anyway, there are a great many sides. This is not just about British Airways and British Caledonian, but about all the airlines and all the passengers. Indeed, it is about the airline industry itself. My regret is that the Secretary of State, Mr. Nicholas Ridley, was unable to muster sufficient support for what I believe should have been done and what he himself wanted to do; namely, to restructure the airline industry in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02180">5.38 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02181"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House and, I think, the civil aviation industry are both indebted, not for the first time, to the noble Baroness for raising this matter on an Unstarred Question this evening. Indeed, I hope I may be allowed to say, from some experience going back over a number of years of the work of the noble Baroness, that I know of no person who has done more for the airline traveller than the noble Baroness, going on from her indefatigable work years ago as a member of the Airline Users Committee, which I very well remember.<lb/>
I hope that my noble friends on the Front Bench will not feel that this brief debate tonight is all that this House should contribute to discussion of this matter. I very much hope that in the new Session we shall have a full-scale debate on the very serious issues of policy which are raised both by the Civil Aviation Authority's report and by the Government's own equally interesting White Paper. I hope they will treat tonight's debate as what I used to call <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> but what now in most restaurants are referred to as starters.<lb/>
There is a very big issue here, but the difference which exists between the Civil Aviation Authority and the Government seems to be one of emphasis and degree rather than of principle. As I understand it, both bodies accept the need for more competition in the British civil aviation industry. In parenthesis, those of your Lordships who use the shuttle services to Scotland will have already experienced one very substantial result of competition&#x2014;the admirable breakfast now served on both airlines. In the days when only one airline operated the shuttle there was no breakfast at all. That is in every sense a very substantial argument in favour of competition, and of benefit to the airline traveller.<lb/>
But, of course, the question of competition revolves around: competition between who? If one competitor is too big and too powerful, we can talk about competition until we have talked our heads off, but there will not be any, because one will dominate the market. What I think the Civil Aviation Authority was seeking to do, and what in more modest degree the Government, I think, were seeking to do, was to alter somewhat the balance between the two biggest British airlines so that competition should not be just a formula&#x2014;not just a phrase&#x2014;but a reality.<lb/>
If one has to judge between the views of the Government and the department concerned&#x2014;and in
<col>484</col>
parenthesis may I say how glad I am that that department is once again the Department of Transport and not, as it was unfortunately for some years, the Department of Trade&#x2014;and the views of the Civil Aviation Authority, your Lordships will not perhaps be wholly surprised if my bias is in favour of the Civil Aviation Authority, where I had the honour to serve for its original five formative years.<lb/>
But that is not sheer prejudice. Your Lordships will be aware that in the CAA there are concentrated most of the really experienced public experts on this industry, headed by a very distinguished and able chairman, with a fine industrial record, and with its economic division headed by Mr. Ray Colegate, to whom the noble Baroness referred and whose services to the British civil aviation industry over the years have been quite extraordinarily valuable and seem to me to merit considerable recognition. Comparisons, I know, are odious, but we have there far more expertise and knowledge on this difficult and highly complicated subject than in the department, or indeed anywhere else. Therefore if your Lordships are to be called upon to exercise a judgment between the decisions of the Government and the decisions of the CAA, I think that most people would be inclined to let their views go in favour of what is the more authoritative and the more expert body.<lb/>
I appreciate that the Government have been in a difficulty over this&#x2014;a difficulty of timing. The fact that this report, for which they called, should come forward in the period when they are proceeding, in my view very properly, with the privatisation of British Airways obviously creates a difficulty. If the Government were to proceed drastically to reduce the scale of British Airways' operations, they must necessarily prejudice in some degree the success of the privatisation operation and therefore the benefit which the British taxpayer can expect to obtain from it. I think that there is an inherent difficulty of timing here.<lb/>
Therefore it is perhaps a very difficult exercise of judgment to decide how much more it is necessary to transfer to British Caledonian and to the rest of the independent sector from British Airways in order to make sure that there are strong enough competitors with British Airways for a reality of competition to be created, not merely on the shuttle but on international routes. This is the serious issue that lies behind this whole matter. It is obviously impossible to deal with it seriously and fully on an Unstarred Question, and that is the major reason why I have already appealed to my noble friends to see to it that this matter is fully debated early in the new Session, which is, after all, a period when your Lordships' House is more likely to have time available than our experience last summer suggests it is later in the Session.<lb/>
That is the major issue, but there is one immediate question that I should like to direct to my noble friend. It deals directly with competition policy. British Airways, British Caledonian and the two major American airlines recently sought to make a substantial reduction&#x2014;a reduction of about &#x00A3;40&#x2014;on transatlantic fares, and they have been forbidden by the Government so to do. It seems difficult to reconcile that with the Government's general policy in favour of competition and the market. I know that there is a fear that the ridiculous excesses of the American anti-trust
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0251"/>
<col>485</col>
legal system might be incensed by this; and that an equally ridiculous proceeding to that being instituted by the liquidator in the United States concerning Laker Airways might complicate the matter. But if we are really to allow reasonable commercial enterprise, of benefit to the consumer, to be restricted by those fears, it is difficult to see how one is pursuing a competitive and effective airline policy at all.<lb/>
I should be particularly grateful to my noble friend if he would answer the question as to whether the suggestion made in the press that the 100,000 or so passengers who have already booked their passages across the North Atlantic on the four airlines concerned at the reduced price are to be surcharged on arrival at the airport on the instructions of the Government. If that were so, I think it would be a most inappropriate action and not least, of course, would cause great congestion, discomfort and hardship at the airport. I hope that at the outcome of this debate we may have an effective denial from my noble friend of that statement.<lb/>
The only other matter that I want to raise relates to the airport facilities available. We cannot have competition, whether on internal or external routes, among British Airways, British Caledonian and the other airlines if insufficient facilities are available at the major airports which everyone wants to use. On this again I should like to press my noble friend about the proposed 275,000 movements a year restriction planned to be imposed on the operation of Heathrow. I know that this is argued on the grounds of aircraft noise and the nuisance to those who live near; but if people already live near an airport, with 275,000 movements a year&#x2014;which, if my mathematics are right, which is highly unlikely, amounts to something like 750 movements a day&#x2014;I cannot believe that it will make very much difference to their life if those movements go up to 350,000 or 400,000 a year. The noise, such as it is, is continuous.<lb/>
There is, of course, a further fact, of which my noble friend is well aware, that because of international agreement on acceptable noise levels of aircraft from, I think, 1986 the noisier aircraft will be excluded from Heathrow, as indeed from all the other major international airports of the world. It would therefore seem, if the individual aircraft are to be quieter, and if the numbers are already to be at 275,000, that it really is a pity to cripple Britain's major airport, and the airport with more international movements than any other airport in the world, by a purely arbitrary, and it seems to me misconceived, restriction.<lb/>
I was glad to hear the noble Baroness press a point which my noble friend knows that I have pressed on him so frequently as to try even his monumental patience; but it is nonsense to have mutilated the original plan for Gatwick by excluding the second runway. I have a bias here to declare. I was the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation who, as long ago as 1954, approved and started the Gatwick project. Like that of all airports planned to be a large airport, the plan allowed for two full-scale runways. A most unfortunate undertaking was given by the then chairman of the British Airports Authority to confine it to only one. Indeed, my noble friend will recall rebuking me in his usual charming way when I said that that undertaking was given to a pressure group.<lb/>
<col>486</col>
He pointed out that it was given to the West Sussex County Council&#x2014;who for the purposes of civil aviation policy are no more than a rather insignificant pressure group. My noble friend has made it clear that the Government have never accepted that they are bound by that foolish and uncalled-for undertaking.<lb/>
My noble friend knows, because he answered the Question about it a few months ago, that, in the light of the planned capacity of Gatwick of 25 million movements a year, there is no other airport in the world which has anything like that number of movements and has only one runway. If therefore Gatwick is to be developed as a second hub airport&#x2014;and indeed, I cannot see how effective airline competition can be developed in any other way&#x2014;particularly with some restriction at Heathrow, then I hope the Government are going to be brave and point out to all concerned, including the West Sussex County Council, that the development of Gatwick Airport in a time of general depression and in employment has put wealth, full employment and great activity into the Gatwick area and that it would be a great mistake to cripple its further development.<lb/>
In parenthesis, your Lordships may be interested to know, in these days of unemployment, that last year I was invited to open a housing development at Gatwick for the reason that there were more jobs available in the Gatwick area than there was accommodation for the workers to live. That is a healthy and cheering aspect of things to see in this day and age. It really would be a pity to spoil the concept because of an undertaking of this sort which does not bind the Government and which must cripple&#x2014;as indeed the Civil Aviation Report indicates&#x2014;the development of Gatwick.<lb/>
Finally, relating to Stanstead, I should say this. I think the Stansted inquiry merits the description once given by a learned judge of certain proceedings which went beyond time and encroached upon eternity. It is 20 years since the Government of which I was a member approved the Stanstead project. We have gone from public inquiry to public inquiry, to the benefit of nobody except, if I may say so, members of my own profession who have been employed professionally almost continually over that period to take part in the inquiry. If the public system is not to be wholly discredited, it is necessary to bring the Stanstead decision to an early and effective end.<lb/>
Those are simply short preliminary points on a subject which, as I have said, I hope your Lordships will have the opportunity of debating in full in the new session. However, I should like again to thank the noble Baroness for giving this opportunity at least to provide what I hope to my noble friend on the Front Bench are not unpalatable <i>hors-d'oeuvres</i>.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02182">5.53 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02183"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Boyd-Carpenter, on two points. First, I agree with him when he says that it is quite absurd to have a one-runway limitation on a major London Airport. I accept everything that he says about that and will try to underline it. I have only one reservation. That is when he said that in his position as Minister of Transport in 1954 he agreed the two-runway principle at Gatwick. Looking back, I thought
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0252"/>
<col>487</col>
that when I was at the Ministry of Civil Aviation in 12950&#x2013;51 we agreed that we should have a two-runway airport there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02184"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would the noble Lord allow me? I think it is the fact that the wisdom which he left behind, in that respect at any rate, remained in the Ministry when we came to the moment of decision of 1954, and I am sure we were very indebted to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02185"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, then my desire to agree with the noble Lord is enhanced.<lb/>
The other point on which I agree with the noble Lord is when he offered his very generous words of praise to the noble Baroness, Lady Burton. The noble Baroness opened the discussion. She posed her Question in a typically informed, fair and balanced manner. I agree with the greater part, if not all, of what she has said. Certainly I agree with her that the Government's policy on civil air transport appears to revolve around, and to have to fit in with, the determination to sell off British Airways, rather than the sale (if so required) of that airline having to fit into an overall policy which includes a determination of the future of not only airlines but airports.<lb/>
However, I am not going to go over the ground which the noble Baroness covered so well. I want to intervene very briefly. I intend to take a little further the question that I put forward yesterday. I then asked if British Airways was still asking that the Government should use taxpayers' money to write off all or part of British Airways' dollar loans. The answer that I was given by the noble Lord who now sits on the Front Bench was an absolute model of courtesy. However, it fell short of complete clarity. The first reply was that no recent proposals had been made. I suppose I was expected to understand from that that the possibility of payment had now been dropped. But then on further questioning it seemed that it was still a matter for decision. I want the Minister to tell me what are the principles involved in this consideration. On what criteria will a decision eventually be made?<lb/>
I try to follow these matters, I hope without undue prejudice. But I find it difficult or impossible to justify any payment of my money or the money of other taxpayers as an inducement to the City to buy British Airways shares. Listening to Ministers so far, I hear them emphasise the merits of competition. While I have said on other occasions that deregulation and the open skies policy can be carried too far, and while I accept the merits of a breakfast on the Scottish shuttle, there are questions of air safety which should also come into these issues. While I accept also that there is some merit in competition, it does not necessarily improve the service, the reliability, the safety of the development of that air service.<lb/>
However, the Government have stated that putting British Airways in the private sector will mean fair competition. The Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, said last week that British Airways will be placed,
<quote>"on the same footing as private sector airlines".</quote>
But will this be true if the privately owned British Airways are operating aircraft which have been paid for by the taxpayer? Is that fair competition? I have
<col>488</col>
looked at this matter from the viewpoint of the present management of British Airways. I read very carefully what they have to say. It seems that they too applaud competition within the private sector. I read in last week's <i>British Airways News</i> that the new chief executive of British Airways was saying&#x2014;and again I quote:
<quote>"Leaving the comfortable confines of Government and going into the hard world of commercial reality was probably the best thing that could ever happen to British Airways".</quote>
Those are very brave words. There are some who would agree with them. But I find it impossible to reconcile that apparently robust spirit with a plea that I and other taxpayers should pay for their aircraft before they try to compete in the hard commercial world about which they speak. Would the Minister not agree that there can be no question of any gifts to British Airways disguised as capital reconstruction if those words of the British Airways chief executive are to be taken seriously?<lb/>
There is another factor involved in this. British Airways have sought, in their very expensive propaganda, to put over the idea that they are offering to help with finance any small airline that wishes to compete against them on the continental routes. But apart from the most practical questions of licences and traffic rights which would be involved in such competition, if this is a genuine offer, may I ask the noble Lord. Lord Trefgarne, who is to answer: whose money are British Airways going to use? Is it their own? Or, again, is it a matter of using taxpayers' money? I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in his customary straightforward replies to those questions.<lb/>
There are just two other points on which I should like some information. As I have said, I believe that de-regulation can be overdone in this business of air transport. But service to the passenger can be improved, and national resources can be more fully utilised by sensible encouragement of competition. That brings me to the future of Prestwick airport. I understand that the future of Prestwick has been considered doubtful. There is an argument&#x2014;I have heard it over the years&#x2014;for closing down Prestwick. But there is also a very good argument for maintaining it as an international airport and also as a manufacturing focus.<lb/>
I am glad to think that there is a lot of activity now going on around Prestwick&#x2014;making aeroplanes&#x2014;with which I was at one time associated. But my understanding is that a new service out of Prestwick could tip the balance into profitability. There is apparently an operator, the Highland Express, prepared to operate a transatlantic service from Prestwick. Can the Minister tell me if a licence for such a service would meet with Government approval and be within the policy of competition that they have announced? I hope that he will say that all unnecessary delays in coming to a decision about that will be eliminated.<lb/>
Similarly, I would have thought that the application of the People's Express airline to operate from Stansted would be in keeping with this need to develop the services out of that airport. Can the Minister tell me what is happening to that application? The airports authority, the Government, or, indeed. Britain as a
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0253"/>
<col>489</col>
whole, are going to have problems with the forthcoming saturation of Heathrow and Gatwick. Those problems would be set back, if not eliminated, if we could have a proper runway system at Gatwick&#x2014;two parallel runways at that airport. But if we cannot have that, any encouragement of services at Stansted or Prestwick would, I think, fit into a rational air transport policy. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell me that he will accede to my request that unnecessary delays are cut out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02186">6.3 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02187"><member>Lord Polwarth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is rather intimidating to attempt to follow the three previous speakers: a former Minister with responsibility in this field, not to mention an erstwhile aviator himself; a former chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority; and, of course, that doughtiest of champions of the travelling public, the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, to whom we are deeply indebted for raising this subject once again. I hope that your Lordships will not take it amiss if, by and large, I support practically all that they have said. I have no doubt that before the debate is over there will be an opportunity for some contrary views.<lb/>
When we last debated this subject on 30th July, much of this ground was covered at great length. But the Government were inhibited in their reply because they were clearly in a dilemma, knowing that they had a tiger by the tail and not knowing quite in what direction to get rid of it. Since then, we have had the White Paper which we are talking about. I must say that it seems to me that it is a smack in the face for the Civil Aviation Authority and nearly an insult to the Minister who commissioned it and who, I am sure, must have fought hard to get it accepted. It is sad, I think, that when such an experienced body as the Civil Aviation Authority came up with a new pattern of unblemished pedigree in direct descent from the Edwards report of 1969, the Government chose finally merely to throw a few morsels to the independents rather than to seize a great opportunity to increase competition in the interests of the traveller.<lb/>
Admittedly, there have been some switches. British Caledonian have been given a swap of some currently profitable routes in place of some currently unprofitable ones. This will, indeed, help their profits to the tune of some &#x00A3;18 million a year. We have this remarkable arrangement by which British Airways are supposed to shell out &#x00A3;450,000 to anyone wanting to open up a route from a provincial airport, whether or not in competition with them. It raises some most intriguing possibilities. The noble Lord, Lord Beswick, has referred to this. We shall watch with great interest to see how it evolves. However, these are very small steps towards giving the independents a broad and strong enough base to compete with what remains an immensely powerful organisation, one soon to be freed of some of the restraints inherent in Government ownership.<lb/>
It is this question of the breadth of base and the strength of base that is much more important than any question of direct competition on individual routes. David has fought Goliath, and this time divine intervention in the form of the Government has not been on David's side. The battle has gone to the strong, at any rate so far, thanks undoubtedly to the
<col>490</col>
Treasury's determination to get its spoils and (one must pay him tribute) to the heavyweight in-fighting of the noble Lord, Lord King, backed, we are told, by threats of resignation. I do not blame him. I think that he would not have been doing his job if he had not done precisely that. But if the Government are not susceptible to further argument, we must face the future as it is. We are told that British Airways and British Caledonian have agreed to the route transfers proposed, although one is bound to suspect that it was a case of, "Agree or else".<lb/>
I hope that the Government and the Civil Aviation Authority will do all in their power to help speed this process of transfer with a view to the new operators being in place, at the latest, in time for the summer schedules next spring. There will be a lot to be done: new links and loyalties to be forged in the respective territories, and staff to be transferred and looked after. I hope that our official representatives in those countries will give every possible help to both airlines in establishing themselves in their new roles. At least I think we can be thankful that the White Paper recognises the need for strengthening the safeguards against anti-competitive and predatory behaviour, although I tend to agree with one of the previous speakers that it is very difficult to define when behaviour does become predatory and it is very difficult to act speedily to deal with it. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord King, would never dream of knowingly or intentionally indulging in such a thing. But size and strength cannot be other than they are. A predator, particularly a large and strong one, can easily create considerable havoc before it can be stopped. I hope, therefore, that those invested with the powers&#x2014;the CAA and these other bodies which are to have a say in it&#x2014;will be constantly watchful and will not hesitate to act effectively and speedily.<lb/>
One word about airports. Already, we have had the subject of Gatwick raised. I make no apology for raising it myself. Heathrow, with all its facilities, remains British Airways' main preserve, with its monopoly of British overseas flights to and from it. Gatwick, by and large, will remain the home, and will become increasingly, we hope, the home and centre, of the independents. If they are to flourish and grow, as the Government say in the White Paper that they hope they will, then Gatwick must have facilities comparable with those at Heathrow. It has a number of advantages already&#x2014;a terminal layout which is much less of a mess than Heathrow and much easier for the traveller to manoeuvre through, although I make a strong plea for travellators to the remoter gates. Sometimes I feel as if I am walking all the way to Edinburgh. The new train service to Victoria is a splendid piece of work&#x2014;a great deal faster, more comfortable and more convenient than the Underground to Heathrow.<lb/>
But its one great deficiency, as other noble Lords have said, is this lack of a second runway. I will not go into the details; other noble Lords have done that well and I strongly support them in the view that no truly major international airport can exist and develop on the basis of a single runway. No undertaking can be given for ever, and I am glad that the Government have not accepted that that is binding. I hope they will again look very seriously at this possibility.<lb/>

In conclusion, I would simply say we must never forget that it is the traveller who must come first&#x2014;the traveller and the shipper of goods by air. I was going to say that I speak only as the man on the Clapham omnibus, but I think it would be more correct to say the man on the Edinburgh Shuttle and the North Atlantic run. I do a very considerable mileage and go through a great many airports in the course of a year. It is for those of us who travel, and all the others for whom air travel is now becoming a possibility, although it was not in the past, that we must seek to ensure a prosperous and competitive air transport industry; and so I join my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter in hoping that we have not had the last word but will have a further opportunity really to thresh out this extremely important subject.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02189"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the phrase "airline competition policy" is reasonably precise, and the report from the Civil Aviation Authority dealt substantially with a range of matters understood to be contained within that phrase. But, as has been demonstrated by previous speakers&#x2014;notably by the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, who time after time serves the best interests not only of this House but of millions of other people who are the travelling public&#x2014;it is not just a question of privatising or not, of route allocations, of market penetration, of predatory or monopolistic pricing. It is, in its effect, very much about the welfare of passengers&#x2014;the consumers of airline services. Of all the groups or categories of air passengers carried by our airlines in both the domestic and international spheres, all of whom are entitled to protection and value for money, none stand in greater need of protection than those whose sole use of an aircraft is for their annual package holiday.<lb/>
Of course, there are issues at stake within the covers of the report of the CAA, and the response by the Government, affecting substantial financial empires. I would not cavil at the Government's response. My contribution to the debate centres on appendix 4, at page 38 of the CAA Report&#x2014;<i>Competition policy in the United Kingdom</i>&#x2014;and in particular that section dealing with anti-competitive practices. I take this with the response by the Government to the references on page 10, paragraphs 28 and 29, to, "Safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour", which were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Polwarth.<lb/>
A key office in these matters is that of the Office of Fair Trading. A crucially important officer is the Director-General of Fair Trading. On page 39 the CAA Report spells out the enlarged powers given to the director under the competition Act 1980. It underlines that it is within his powers to initiate reviews of&#x2014;and I quote:
<quote>"the carrying on of commercial activities in the United Kingdom, in relation to the supply of goods and services".</quote>
The Office of Fair Trading has the main initiating role within both the judicial system&#x2014;in this case by taking cartel agreements to the court for judgment&#x2014;and the discretionary system, in this case by taking monopoly and anti-competitive practice problems to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and advising Ministers on whether particular mergers should go to the MMC. In this context, I note with particular
<col>492</col>
interest a reference made in respect of holiday companies. I await with interest the outcome of that.<lb/>
Further down on page 39 we are told that among areas of special concern to the Office of Fair Trading is that of potential monopoly situations. We are told that particular attention is paid to the economic performance of larger firms&#x2014;I stress "larger"&#x2014;together with information on price levels and movements, profits and market behaviour; I stress the words "market behaviour".<lb/>
I noted with appreciation the definition, on page 40, of anti-competitive practices:
<quote>"An anti-competitive practice is the pursuit of a course of conduct in the course of business which has, or is intended to have, or is likely to have, the effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition in connection with the production, supply or acquisition of goods, or the supply of services in the United Kingdom or any part of it".</quote>
I am a firm believer in keeping as low as possible the cost to the consumer of travel and package holidays, consistent with business integrity and fair dealing. I trust that the Government are mindful of the need to see that anti-competitive practices, wherever they can be discerned and proved, are tackled with the utmost vigour. When all else fails, the last line of defence for the consumer must be a vigilant government and their regulatory agencies.<lb/>
The package holiday business does not lack watchdogs set up by either the industry or governmental decisions. By chance, I listened to the chairman of the Association of British Travel Agents on the radio on Saturday morning. He impressed me with his views and with his authority as well as the good sense of what he said. He was commenting on the appalling and dreadful plight of many thousands of users of British aircraft companies. I recall his saying that the holiday package was a unique concept in that so many distinctive and separate businesses were elements within the package. Yet to the public, it is the travel agent who is seen as the front man&#x2014;the body through whom they buy their holiday.<lb/>
He told us that last year 10 travel companies had gone bust, and that already this year there were 13 who had gone the same way. I was particularly alert when I thought I heard him say that the CAA should be more concerned to ensure that the holiday business is better organised. I ask noble Lords to bear in mind that this was said in the context of the distress caused to innocent working people who invest a fair amount of their savings to enjoy their holiday.<lb/>
I ask the Minister the straight question: are the Government satisfied that the self-regulating machinery within the travel business is adequate to deal with the current disasters, and perhaps with others? Reputable and experienced travel operators can look after not only themselves but also their customers. They will take care to look at the choice by the main holiday companies of all the elements in the package&#x2014;the contractors, the airlines, the hotels. But if the main spokesman for the travel agents&#x2014;the chairman of ABTA&#x2014;tells us that the CAA should ensure that the holiday business is better organised, what are the Government going to do about that?<lb/>
So while I recognise the complex nature of the major issues within the covers of both the CAA report and the Government's response, and while I appreciate that the Government seem to have made proposals
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0255"/>
<col>493</col>
with which all parties can live, I return to my main concern&#x2014;that is, concern for the consumer. I echo the unease expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, in an excellent speech that, as good as the Office of Fair Trading is&#x2014;and I endorse her appreciation of the work of the Director General Sir Gordon Borrie&#x2014;it is essential that it has the resources and the back-up to produce its reports in far quicker time than it is able at present. The noble Baroness, Lady Burton, drew our attention to both time and the time that inquiries take. Surely these can be speeded up with more adequate financial support from the Government.<lb/>
I also share the view of the noble Baroness that consumers are very often found to be in favour until they start to make demands and become nuisances by, for example, wanting protection from bad businesses and shady businessmen involved in the air-carrying business <i>Caveat emptor</i> may have been good enough as the basis for consumer protection once; it is not any more. We want stronger Government action, and we want it now.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02190">6.21 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02191"><member>Lord Bruce-Gardyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, let me begin by apologising to the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, for not having heard the beginning of her remarks. I had been watching closely for the commencement of the debate, but nevertheless I am afraid that I managed to miss the beginning thereof and I apologise to the noble Baroness and to the House. I should also like to join with all those who have complimented the noble Baroness on raising this subject tonight and on her own great personal record in the promotion of the interests of the travelling consumer.<lb/>
It would be fair to say that the White Paper that we are discussing tonight has received what I might describe as mixed notices from both sides of the House. My noble friend Lord Polwarth described it as a smack in the face to the Civil Aviation Authority. I confess that I am less clear than some noble Lords that as regards this matter the Government faced a very wide choice of options. On the one hand, they were confronted by the threat, the possibility, of the resignation of the board of British Airways, at a rather crucial moment in the history of that institution, if they were to follow the recommendations of the Civil Aviation Authority. On the other hand, if they did not achieve some measure of satisfaction for the major independent airline, British Caledonian, there was the possibility of British Caledonian continuing to apply for routes which the Civil Aviation Authority in some cases would have recommended that it should have had and there would have been the prospect of continuous litigation, which equally would have interfered with the flotation of British Airways.<lb/>
Therefore, it seems to me that my right honourable friends were caught in a rather narrow straitjacket. Under all the circumstances I suspect that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport extracted rather more crumbs from Lord King's table than perhaps my noble friend Lord King had originally intended to offer. However, I am not so sure, as my noble friend Lord Polwarth said, whether a great opportunity was thereby missed.<lb/>
I venture to suggest that if one analyses the CAA report, one finds that, while the rhetoric of
<col>494</col>
competition is strongly present, in practice what the CAA was really talking about was a shuffling of the pack rather than the introduction of new cards. We were talking about the transfer of a monopoly service on one route from British Airways to a monopoly service to be provided by British Caledonian. In the international arena there was no actual enhancement offered in the CAA report as regards the broadening of competition to the end consumer, and, of course, that was for reasons which nobody knows better than my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter. The problem that arises is that so many of the international routes, particularly those to Western Europe, are governed by pooling arrangements between governments which are not within the power of the CAA or the British Government to abrogate unilaterally and yet which, of course, are a complete denial of the whole concept of competition.<lb/>
Therefore, under those circumstances personally I do not feel convinced that there was a great opportunity lost. However, I wonder whether there might not have been something to be said for being prepared to witness some delay in the privatisation of British Airways to enable more progress to be made in the opening up in particular of the European routes to the forces of competition by dual designation, recognising that that could not come about except by international negotiation and that it would take time. I am delighted to see that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport has now embarked upon that task and has made headway with it. However, it is bound to take time before a major breakthrough is achieved because of the need for international agreement thereon. I am inclined to feel that there might have been something to be said for delaying the privatisation of British Airways until it could come to the market in a genuinely competitive environment.<lb/>
That leads me to perhaps the one real anxiety I have about the White Paper; namely, I should have thought that there was something to be said for requiring British Airways to separate its air tours operation for separate flotation in order to make sure that within the arena of package tour operations&#x2014;and as the noble Lord, Lord Graham, has pointed out, it is highly competitive; indeed, one might almost say that it is a cut-price market&#x2014;there could not be a legitimate claim by other operators that British Airways was indulging in cross-subsidisation.<lb/>
The key to this seems to me to be a separate flotation for British Air Tours. It was my impression that that was a proposition upon which British Airways might have looked with, if not favour, at least some indulgence. Perhaps the reason such a proposition was not included in the White Paper was the fear that it might have diminished the "take" for the Treasury from the proceeds of privatisation. In that context&#x2014;particularly if one considers the nature of the sources of finance for privatisation and bears in mind the importance of the institutions which might otherwise be buying Government gilts&#x2014;the significance of the contribution which privatisation actually makes to reducing the public sector borrowing requirement seems to be, frankly, a somewhat secondary consideration. I venture to wonder whether the Treasury would not be well advised to be
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0256"/>
<col>495</col>
somewhat less impatient to obtain the proceeds of privatisation than it has displayed itself to be as regards the last few cases and perhaps in the case of British Aerospace.<lb/>
I do not wish to delay your Lordships because I want to make only a brief intervention. I rather doubt whether a major opportunity has been missed in this instance. It is so much more important that we should press ahead with the unscrambling of the pooling arrangements and establish dual designation routes which alone can offer the airline customer a real choice.<lb/>
Before I sit down I want to reiterate the points so ably made by my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter. It would be very helpful at this juncture if my noble friend, in replying to the debate, could say something about the present battle that has apparently arisen between the Department of Transport and the American authorities. Like my noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter, I must say that the prospect of Her Majesty's Government being engaged in the business of surcharging passengers on the transatlantic routes is not one that should have a great appeal to your Lordships' House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02192">6.30 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02193"><member>Lord Underhill</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with some trepidation that I speak from the Front Bench on behalf of the Opposition in the light of the experienced and well-informed persons who have taken part in this debate. However, I too should like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, for giving us the opportunity not only to have a preliminary canter around the Government White Paper but also because this is the third opportunity which we have had in recent months to discuss the policy of civil aviation.<lb/>
At the end of June we discussed the matter on the CAA's interim assessment before they issued their report. At the end of July we were discussing it on the CAA report in the absence of any policy direction from the Government. On that occasion I reiterated what the noble Baroness said&#x2014;that it was a pity that we were not discussing the matter in the light of all the other reports, many of which are still awaited. Now we have the opportunity to discuss the matter as a preliminary canter with the Government White Paper on the CAA report. I, along with other noble Lords, wish to avoid going over the same arguments that we used on the previous occasions, but some points must be made.<lb/>
Paragraph 3 of the Government White Paper points out that historically most sectors of air transport have been heavily regulated and protected by the state, and that that is still the position in many countries. It emphasises that the Government have to take account of that in bilateral relations. This was a point that some of us made in the previous debates, and one reason why some of us put forward the point that Britain's national flag carrier must not be weakened in any way because of this international situation.<lb/>
Paragraph 5 of the White Paper states:
<quote>"The Edwards Committee report of 1969 set the pattern for Britain's airline industry over the last decade."</quote>
It points out that the committee supported the development of a competitive multi-airline industry,
<col>496</col>
but it is significant that there was one glaring omission, and a glaring omission to which I referred on the CAA report. I drew attention to the fact that not only did the Edwards Committee say what the Government have said but they also made clear that aviation policy must include a public sector; that there was no case whatever for denationalisation of BOAC and BEA, which were the then predecessors of British Airways. Edwards said that those publicly-owned airlines should be confirmed as the major operators. It is strange that the CAA made no reference to that. It is strange that, although the Government give an historical account, they leave out that important historical point.<lb/>
The Labour Party policy remains as it was when the Edwards report was produced. There must be a strong public sector airline as the national flag carrier, and it is essential in Britain's interests that we should maintain that in order to keep our position in world aviation, and also that we accept the desirability of a smaller second force. So far as the opposition is concerned, we wish to retain BA as our pre-eminent airline but also to encourage the development of BCal as our second force.<lb/>
We stand by the Edwards report. Everyone has given praise to the recent development of British Airways I would remind you&#x2014;within the public sector. Without diverting too much, it is strange how the Government seem to look at various industries. There is BL, saved by the public sector; Rolls-Royce, which had to be brought into the public sector; British Telecom, one of the most successful industries in the world, and yet the Government are getting rid of it; Cable and Wireless, which was very successful. Transport Docks was one of the highly profitable industries, and the Government decided to get rid of it; the National Bus Company, which everybody admits is an efficient undertaking, and the Government now wish to dispose of under their buses White Paper. We have praise lavished on British Airways, and yet the Goverment wish to take it out of the public sector.<lb/>
However by and large we welcome the decisions in the White Paper in so far as they affect British Airways. I should like to feel that those decisions were solely in the interests of civil aviation policy. However the CAA was not asked to review civil aviation policy, it was asked to review the implications of privatisation for competition and development of the British airline industry. It had to take the threatened privatisation into account.<lb/>
Paragraph 14 of the Government's White Paper refers to the uncertainty of the industry about the outcome of that review. It says that,
<quote>"Uncertainties affecting the privatisation of British Airways must be resolved."</quote>
When we move to paragraph 24 we find that the White Paper observes that even the limited exchange of routes which has been agreed between BA and BCal will mean that the Exchequer will recieve less on privatisation of BA than would otherwise have been the case. It is clear that the Government were concerned that any major transfer of routes would seriously affect the future flotation of British Airways.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Gardyne, referred to the conflicting aims of the Secretary of State. <i>The</i>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0257"/>
<col>497</col>
<i>Times</i> leader of 8th October said that the Secretary of State was,
<quote>"caught between conflicting demands for greater long-term competition and for speedy privatisation of British Airways at a good price".</quote>
Some of us have stressed throughout this controversy that it has little to do with competition. We have to take into consideration the effect of bilateral agreements; that there are few opportunities for multiple designation; that there is the important question of international agreements between governments; and that there is little opportunity for head-to-head competition. What the argument has been about has been the compulsory transfer of routes between what would be two private airlines. That has little to do with real competition as such.<lb/>
We had the massive advertising campaign. We have heard talk of advertising campaigns of other public bodies, and we have had a massive advertising campaign. On 7th October the <i>Sunday Times</i> Business News in its Comment Column, referring to the CAA review, said:
<quote>"No one expected it to degenerate into the grubby horse trading of the past few weeks."</quote>
I agree with the noble Baroness that we have no desire to support a private monopoly, but we have to face the situation as it is and we must support the Government view that the CAA proposals could be disruptive of British Airways if carried out, and that there must be no weakening of Britain's national airline. I shall not go into all the arguments, but for all the international reasons it is important that there should be no weakening.<lb/>
Therefore, we welcome the decision for no enforced reduction of British Airways' size and no compulsory transfer of routes, not in the interests of shareholders of the future privately-owned British Airways, but in Britain's interests as a leading aviation nation and also in the interests of passengers. We welcome also the decision of the Government published in the White Paper in favour of the continuation of British Airways' scheduled international services from Gatwick. That we believe is in the interests of our flag carrier as such, and also in the interests of the future development of Gatwick.<lb/>
We have argued, especially in the last debate, that British Airways should retain its scheduled European services from Manchester and Birmingham Airports. I am pleased that the Government have decided to reject the CAA recommendation that those services should be given up by British Airways and transferred to independents. We welcome that decision, again in the interests of our national airline and also in the interests of the regional airports of Birmingham and Manchester. The airport authorities of both those airports expressed considerable concern about the CAA proposals and we are pleased that the Government have decided that BA should continue its European services from those airports.<lb/>
We hope that that will be the final position because not only have those authorities faced that possibility in the CAA report, but they and other airports are being affected by the proposal for the abolition of the metropolitan counties, which will affect the airports under the control of some of the county councils.<lb/>
<col>498</col>
I regret that there is nothing in the White Paper dealing with airport policy as such, except the one reference to the limit on flights out of Heathrow. Naturally, we shall await with keen interest the consultation which is taking place on the future of the Scottish lowland airports. We shall await with keen interest, as will every other noble Lord, the final report, when it comes, on Stanstead and the possible fifth terminal at Heathrow. I hope that the Government will be able to state quite categorically that they will not proceed with their threatened privatisation of the British Airports Authority. On the grounds of efficiency, there is no case whatever; it is an efficient public undertaking. On the grounds of meeting its financial targets, there is no argument; it is meeting what the Government require. What can be gained by taking the British Airports Authority out of the public sector? Nothing whatever except following Government political dogma.<lb/>
We await not only the reports to which I have referred but the results of the consultation paper about the future of the permitted flights from and to Heathrow. I was concerned in the consultation paper to see that the view of the Department of Transport was given as favouring the maximum use of market mechanisms rather than regulatory intervention. Perhaps the Minister will tell me what that means. Does that mean that it will be determined by an increased price for the users of Heathrow? That will obviously have some effect upon the passengers. That is put in the consultation paper as being the view of the department.<lb/>
I am not sure whether it is an offer, but reference has been made to British Airways giving financial support to the independents who may wish to have flights to the Continent from six of the regional airports. I wonder whether that was an offer or another piece of arm-twisting in this game which has been going on. One thing made quite clear in the White Paper is that, even if that proceeds and the Government go ahead with the comparative deregulation of domestic air services, the CAA will still have to continue to regulate an entry to most of the routes. It makes it quite clear that there can be no complete deregulation of domestic services because of the need to control access to practically all the British airports. That is a view that most of us would accept.<lb/>
We are also pleased that the Government are not proposing any additional powers for the Civil Aviation Authority. We want it to remain, as I said on the last debate, as a regulatory body; that is its function and one which it does extremely well.<lb/>
Before I close, I emphasise what other noble Lords have said about paragraphs 28 and 29&#x2014;the safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour. It is strange that those who want the utmost market competition suddenly get worried when a big fish comes among them. It is strange, also, as we found in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 24th October, that the public interest is likely to be damaged since a privatised concern would exploit its monopoly power more aggressively. That surely is another argument for leaving BA where it is, successfully within the public sector.<lb/>
As some noble Lords have asked, and I shall ask the Minister again, what is "predatory competition"? When does competition become predatory? What is
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0258"/>
<col>499</col>
"unfair competition"? The noble Baroness referred to a communication received from Britannia. I also received a communication. It said at one point that British Airways' use of spare planes on charter flights at week-ends is unfair. But, surely, is that not efficiency? If an undertaking has spare planes because they are not used at that particular time, surely using them on another section of the business is in the interests of passengers, is right and proper and should not be criticised. It is the same as the National Bus Company through its subsidiaries, using spare stage carriage vehicles on express coach services because it can use the interplay. Surely no one will say that that is unfair competition; yet at least one of the airlines is saying that it is.<lb/>
The Government have endorsed the recommendations of the CAA that BA cannot be kept out of the charter industry. It would have been a travesty for those who have the pressure of market competition if the Government had not supported the CAA in that attitude. Incidentally, I remind noble Lords of what I said during the last debate. After the BAA's own air tours charter section, the other four mainline British charter airlines are not exactly independent. They are all owned by travel operators, which brings in the point that my noble friend Lord Graham raised.<lb/>
The conclusion, paragraph 36 of the White Paper opens up a considerable argument. The Labour Party does not believe that simple reliance on competition and market forces will achieve a sensible distribution of air transport services. The CAA report was, in effect, an argument for "regulated " competition, not competition. If one reads the White Paper very carefully, despite its claim in a few lines in paragraph 36, it cannot be said that it is arguing for open competition.<lb/>
I hope that the Government will take a careful look at the whole situation, decide not to proceed with damaging the British Airports Authority, and realise, when they have considered all the arguments that have been put forward, that British Airways might, in the interests of this country and its passengers be left where it is successfully in the public sector.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02194">6.48 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02195"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as I think every noble Lord has rightly and properly said, we are most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, for giving us this early opportunity of considering the recent White Paper on airline competition policy. This debate has illustrated the wide interest in the Question and, dare I say, the widely differing views held about it. Ever since the CAA published its report in July, much&#x2014;some might say too much&#x2014;of the public discussion has focussed on the sensitive issue of route transfers. The White Paper rejected the idea of transfers and I shall deal with them later. But it is important to remember that the Authority's proposals for transfers where never an end in themselves. They were only the means to an end.<lb/>
The CAA was concerned in its report to promote a strong and competitive multi-airline industry and the Government warmly endorse that basic strategy. The objectives set out in paragraph 4 of the White Paper make this abundantly clear. The cornerstone of our
<col>500</col>
airline policy, consistent with maintaining high safety standards, is the promotion of competition wherever it makes sense.<lb/>
The White Paper also sets out three further objectives intended to ensure that competition really happens. A necessary pre-condition for true competition, but not a guarantee of it, is the privatisation of British Airways. We are still on target for privatisation in early 1985. For the first time since the pioneering days of the industry, now nearly half a century ago, all Britain's airlines will be competing on an equal footing and none will be insulated by the state from the rigours of the market place. But privatisation alone is not enough to guarantee competition. That is why the Government have also spelt out in the White Paper their commitment to a sound and competitive multi-airline industry, strong enough to compete wing tip to wing tip with foreign airlines. Finally, but no less important, competition must be fair, and I shall return to this in a moment.<lb/>
I shall not dwell on the steps which the Government have taken since 1979 to promote competition. The record can speak for itself. Suffice it to say that those who travel regularly between Heathrow and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast, between London and Hong Kong and, most recently, to the Netherlands can all testify to the improved levels of service which liberalisation and competition have brought about. We can expect further liberalisation both at home and abroad. The Government have already welcomed the CAAs proposals to introduce, as a two-year experiment, an area facility allowing airlines to serve any domestic routes except those to Heathrow and Gatwick, which have to be excluded for capacity reasons, and perhaps some life-line routes to remote communities. The authority is also proposing to cease regulating domestic air fares although they will still need to be filed so that the authority can intervene, where necessary, to prevent predatory or monopoly behaviour.<lb/>
Internationally, most of the opportunities for competition between British airlines lie in the short-haul routes to Europe where traffic is sufficient enough to support a number of carriers. It is our belief that on many European routes it is not enough simply to have one British and one foreign airline. Without a second British carrier on the route, the vital irritant will be missing and it is all too easy for the incumbents to perpetuate a relationship which is cosy for them, if not for the consumer. Wherever we can negotiate suitable arrangements with European countries&#x2014;or indeed, other countries overseas&#x2014;we will designate any British airline willing and able to compete on a route.<lb/>
Our intentions in respect of dual or even multiple designation are quite firm. What we must, of course, secure are adequate opportunities for competition. The best of them lie within the European Community. For that reason, we welcomed the Commission's modest proposals for a common policy earlier this year even though they do not go far enough. We very much hope that the high level group examining the case for liberalisation will recommend significant and rapid progress. Other member states, we believe, are beginning to recognise the advantages of such a liberal policy. Indeed, in the short term, perhaps the best
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0259"/>
<col>501</col>
prospects for liberalisation lie in bilateral negotiations with other, like-minded member states. But opportunities for competition are not by themselves sufficient. Airlines must also be strong enough to take full advantage of them.<lb/>
This brings me to what some have seen, I think mistakenly, as the core of the CAA's recommendations; namely, route transfers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02196"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wonder if I may intervene. The noble Lord has spoken a lot about liberalisation. As an airline pilot, he has not once mentioned the need to ensure air safety.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02197"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall be making a reference at least to that later. But the noble Lord knows, I am sure, the importance that the Government have always attached to that matter, as indeed have all previous governments. Nothing in our policy must be taken as in any way departing from that particular position. Of course, that is a matter for the Civil Aviation Authority and it is a matter that they take with the utmost seriousness.<lb/>
The motive behind the proposal&#x2014;and I am returning now to the route transfers proposal&#x2014;was not simply that routes should be transferred for their own sake. In the authority's view, transfers were necessary to strengthen British Caledonian and other independent airlines so that they might then be able to compete more effectively with British Airways and foreign airlines.<lb/>
The White Paper accepts both the motivation behind the CAA's proposals and their spirit. It is not some sort of victory for British Airways as the ill-informed have claimed. On our calculations, British Caledonian comes out of the bargain some &#x00A3;18 million a year better off in terms of pre-tax profits. That is more than the airline has ever earned in any year of its entire existence. The route exchange leaves British Caledonian financially stronger and far better placed to take advantage of dual designation opportunities in the future.<lb/>
But as your Lordships have asked, why an exchange and not a simple transfer; and why &#x00A3;18 million? Why not more? There are several reasons why we decided against transfers and, let me be frank about one of them, transfers needed legislation. Not only would legislation have been contentious; it would have delayed the privatisation of British Airways, one of the foundations of our policy for greater competition. But there were other reasons for rejecting compulsory transfers. They would have been very disruptive to British Airways. Its network would have been dislocated and quite significant numbers of staff affected. Nor would there have been any stimulus to direct competition.<lb/>
Furthermore, so far as British Caledonian is concerned, in our view the CAA's proposals went further than was necessary to build it up financially. We judged that &#x00A3;18 million is just about right and is sufficient for British Caledonian to take advantage of the opportunities likely to be available soon for new services in competition with British Airways. In a way, it was more difficult for the Government to decide on the CAA's recommendations for the transfer of British Airways' regional routes to Europe. As the White
<col>502</col>
Paper recognises, the CAA advanced some cogent arguments for such transfers. On the other hand, the airports concerned were bitterly opposed to the idea and saw the loss of Britain's largest carrier on European routes as potentially very damaging to their standing as alternatives to the London airports. On balance, we decided against transfers, particularly as they would have added nothing to direct competition. Instead of transfers, British Airways has offered to help the independents develop a limited number of new services from the regions to Europe with financial assistance and other support. The offer applies just as much to independents wanting to introduce services in competition with British Airways on its existing routes as to completely new services. We believe the offer will genuinely lead to new services which the independents would not otherwise be able to introduce because of their development costs.<lb/>
I said at the beginning that it is essential that competition is fair. The White Paper fully recognises this fact. We considered very carefully whether the CAA's existing powers are adequate to promote competition and to act, if necessary, against anticompetitive or predatory behaviour. We concluded that they are and that the authority can attach suitable conditions to air transport licences and curb such behaviour where it can be demonstrated. The CAA is therefore to remain the principal agent for action against anti-competitive behaviour and should be able to act sufficiently quickly through the licensing system when called upon. At the same time, we plan to extend the Director-General of Fair Trading's role in relation to civil aviation. In addition to his present power to look at domestic services under the Competition Act 1980, he will also be empowered to look at charters under that Act and to refer monopoly questions concerning both domestic and charter services to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation under the Fair Trading Act 1973.<lb/>
The Government believe it right that as air transport is liberalised it should in this way be brought more into the mainstream of competition legislation as it applies to industry generally. The position with international scheduled services, however, is complicated by air services agreements, and consequently that is not to be brought within the Director-General's remit. But the Government will retain their present powers to refer monopoly questions concerning such services to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.<lb/>
May I turn now to some of the points that have been raised during the course of this evening's debate? The noble Baroness, Lady Burton, in her admirable opening speech, asked about the liberalisation of services to West Germany. We hope to announce before long progress towards more liberal air service arrangements with West Germany. Talks with the Germans are continuing, and we are encouraged by the agreement reached earlier this month on the introduction of new excursion fares for the winter. In many cases, these are 40 per cent. below those previously available.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter asked about a number of matters, particularly about the North Atlantic winter fares, and my noble friend Lord Bruce-Gardyne was concerned with that matter, too. The Department of Transport considered it necessary to
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0260"/>
<col>503</col>
seek reassurance from the United States Government that the proposed new fares would not be used as the basis for future anti-trust actions, even though we do not accept that such actions would be consistent with Bermuda 2. Since the United States Government did not provide that reassurance, the department, very reluctantly, turned down the filings from United States airlines for lower winter fares. As a result, I am afraid to say, tickets sold on the basis of these lower fares are not valid and passengers must therefore buy new tickets at the higher approved fares before they can travel. My noble friend&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02198"><member>Lord Bruce-Gardyne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend allow me to intervene before he leaves that point? Surely, as one understands, there are many tens of thousands of supposedly valid tickets which are in issue and in circulation. What happens about them?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02199"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the position is&#x2014;I am speaking from memory on these matters, and my noble friend will forgive me, therefore, if I do not get it quite right&#x2014;that the tickets were sold, or should have been sold, subject to the condition that the fare had not yet been approved. The fact is, therefore, that those who seek to travel on those tickets will have to surrender them for new tickets and pay the additional element of the fare that is now required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02200"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend allow me to intervene on this point? Is he really saying that a person who turns up at the airport with a ticket bought in good faith at the lower rate will be told that that ticket is valueless unless he puts up another &#x00A3;40?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02201"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry to say that that is the case. My own view&#x2014;and I am speaking personally here&#x2014;is that the tickets should really not have been sold when there was some doubt as to whether the fare would be authorised, because that must have been clear to the airlines when they chose to sell the tickets at the lower fare for which they had not received approval. I hope your Lordships will allow me to emphasise that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02202"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my noble friend is very good in giving way again. I hope that the Government will give further thought to this point. Accepting that, it may be, the airlines ought not to have sold the tickets, they were sold and they were purchased in good faith. Is it not really very serious indeed to face people, who may not have been able to afford any more, with the alternative of abandoning their tickets and what they have paid or paying more than they may be able to afford? Cannot the Government give further thought to this; and would even the American system cause any trouble if they were allowed to travel on the earlier fare, even if other people are not allowed later on?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02203"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can understand the concern which my noble friend expresses in this matter, and I am bound to say that I share that concern; but I have to say that the position is as I have described it. I very much regret that position, but it was not a position of the Government's making.</membercontribution></p>
<col>504</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02204"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I follow this point a little further? The noble Lord has made it clear that the fault appears to be that of the airlines. Suppose the airlines said, "We have made a mistake. You will have to pay the proper fare, but we will advance you the difference between the fare you have paid and that which you will have to pay. We will pay that as compensation for our mistake". Would they then be contravening any regulation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02205"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord asks me to comment on the legal implications of a hypothetical situation. I hope he will forgive me if I do not do that. But, naturally, anything that can be done to relieve the distress of the would-be-travellers is something which I would welcome, provided that it fell within the ambit of the regulations.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Boyd-Carpenter also asked me about airport matters more generally, and some of these points were in the mind of the noble Baroness, Lady Burton and others as well. Your Lordships will wish to know that the inspector's report on the Stansted inquiry is now expected very shortly. I clearly cannot comment on the cases made at the public inquiry. I can also say that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State is currently considering the response to consultations on how to implement the 275,000 ATM limit at Heathrow. I cannot yet say how it will be implemented, but I have to say that imposed it will be when Terminal 4 comes into use next year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02206"><member>Lord Boyd-Carpenter</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend allow me to intervene? He said that his right honourable friend is considering how to implement the 275,000 limit. Does that mean that he has rejected entirely the proposal to increase it?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02207"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>:, My Lords, I have to say that the 275,000 ATM limit will be imposed at that level when Terminal 4 comes into use next year. That would be honouring previous undertakings, and not to impose it would certainly reopen the basis of the Stansted and Terminal 5 inquiries. But my right honourable friend has also said that he may be able to review the limit once we have experienced it in operation. With regard to the second runway at Gatwick, I doubt whether I have anything much to add to what I have said in the past on that matter on a large number of occasions. Suffice it to say that the Government's position has not changed.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Beswick, asked about licences for Highland Express at Prestwick. This is a matter, in the first place, for the Civil Aviation Authority. The Secretary of State would only become involved if there were an appeal. Because of the potential appellate role, I could not comment on the merits of the Highland Express application. My right honourable friend is also still considering an application from People's Express in connection with their service from Stansted.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Graham, referred to the regulation of the holiday industry. This is a complex business, and is not one directly concerned with airline competition policy. There is an element of regulation via the Civil Aviation Authority; it is not just a self-regulating industry. There is a good deal of complicated stuff available on that. I wonder whether the noble Lord will allow me to write to him on the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0261"/>
<col>505</col>
matter, which I shall be very happy to do. It is certainly something which has most recently given rise to a great deal of thought.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02208"><member>Lord Graham of Edmonton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02209"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord appears to have left the question that I asked, Is he not going to give me any information about the moneys for which British Airways have asked to wipe out their outstanding loans for the American aircraft.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02210"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord asked a question on that yesterday and received what I consider was a very effectively delivered reply from my noble friend Lord Brabazon. But I think that the noble Lord is in something of a misunderstanding over all this, because in almost every case British Airways have bought their aeroplanes&#x2014;I think this is the point he was making&#x2014;on a commercial basis, the main exception to that being, of course, the Concorde purchase which was subsequently written-off, as the noble Lord will know.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02211"><member>Lord Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, they borrowed money in the United States to buy American aircraft and they are asking the British Government for taxpayers' money to wipe out that loan. I am asking what criteria will be applied in making a decision as to whether or not they should be given this money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02212"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am not aware of any such request for taxpayers' money to wipe out the loan, as the noble Lord says. We are still thinking about the terms of the British Airways flotation and I really cannot add to what my noble friend had to say on this matter yesterday.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Bruce-Gardyne asked about the possibility of a separate privatisation of British Air Tours, which is the main charter arm of British Airways. British Air Tours has only about 15 per cent. of the charter market, and so it is nowhere near even a statutory monopoly. Hiving it off, or even banning British Airways from whole plane charters, would not benefit competition, or the consumer. The solution is to ensure that there are adequate safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour in the charter market. I believe that the steps which we are proposing will achieve that aim.<lb/>
Competition is the heart and soul of this Government's airline policy. That is why we asked the Civil Aviation Authority in the first place to review the implications of privatising British Airways for competition and the sound development of the industry. Far from rejecting the authority's report, we have warmly endorsed the steps it proposes to take to develop competition.<lb/>
For the Government's part, the White Paper shows that much of the spirit of the authority's report has been met. Financially, British Caledonian will be a much healthier airline than hitherto and will be better able to compete with British Airways. The other independents now have a major opportunity to grow further in the regions, aided by British Airways, which is offering to help them to develop just about as many new regional services to Europe as it operates itself. We have made sure that the safeguards against anti-
<col>506</col>
competitive behaviour are adequate. Above all, we have reaffirmed in the White Paper the Government's commitment to competition and to getting the best possible deal for those who travel on Britain's airlines.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TRAINING LEVY</title>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02258"><member>Lord Aylestone</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02259">Whether, in the preparation of the Industrial Training Levy (Construction Board) Order 1984, they will bear in mind the importance of encouraging the recruitment of more apprentices in the building industry by replacing the system of a "per capita" levy by a levy based on the payroll, as recommended by the Construction Industry Training Board Working Party.</p>

The board's current levy proposals therefore include provision for a per capita based occupational levy as in previous years. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Employment will not approve the making of a levy order unless he is satisfied that the levy proposals submitted by an industrial training board are necessary to encourage adequate training in the industry.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02261">The Government clearly spelt out in the White Paper <i>Training for Jobs</i> (Cmnd. 9135) the need to modernise traditional training practices, including apprenticeships, in order to increase the supply of skills trainees. The Government continue to provide financial support for approved first year apprentice training through the Youth Training Scheme. I am pleased to report that in 1983&#x2013;84 the Construction Industry Training Board managed a scheme which provided around 18,000 places for craft and technician trainees, and some 90 per cent. of those who completed a second year of skills training.</p>

<title>WEED RESEARCH ORGANISATION</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02262"><member>Lord Mulley</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02263">If they will reconsider their decision to close the Weed Research Organisation at Begbroke in view of the excellent record of the establishment over many years, its established facilities and favourable location for its research and the continuing necessity of seeking to sustain this research in the interests of agriculture at the minimum cost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02264"><member>The Earl of Swinton</member>: The Weed Research Organisation is an institute of the Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC), which is grant-aided by the Department of Education and Science. It is the practice of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science to make over the grant-in-aid to the council without direction as to how it should be spent. It is thus for the AFRC to decide its scientific priorities and to take appropriate action following such decisions. I understand that the council has no fresh evidence to justify reconsidering its decision to close the Weed Research Organisation and to transfer much of its work to Long Ashton Research Station. That decision was reached after careful consideration of all relevant factors.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0264"/>
<col>511</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02265">The transfer will benefit the work on weed science by its closer association with other scientific disciplines at Long Ashton which have not been represented at the Weed Research Organisation. The consolidation should also help the integration of crop protection practices with crop husbandry generally, aimed at creating efficient and environmentally acceptable production systems for farmers. As now, environmental diversity will be achieved by conducting field experiments on farms in various parts of the country. Furthermore, additional land in a predominantly cereals growing area and within a reasonable working distance of Long Aston will be sought in due course for field experimentation on arable crops.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02266">The AFRC intends that this work, which will account for about 70 per cent. of the current WRO programme, will retain its identity within the wider programme at Long Ashton and that there will continue to be a national point of contact on weed control matters for the advisory services, farmers and the agrochemical industry.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02267"><member>The Marquess of Ailesbury</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02268">How they justify adding in a "freight charge" when calculating the amount which must be paid to H.M. Customs and Excise when a private individual imports a car.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02269"><member>The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Arts (The Earl of Gowrie)</member>: EC legislation requires that the value for customs duty of a privately imported motor vehicle must normally be based on the price paid plus, if not already included, any additional costs incurred by the buyer in respect of transport and insurance up to the place of introduction to the customs territory of the Community. The value for VAT is based on the customs value, except that transport costs up to the port or place of introduction into the United Kingdom are included.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02271"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Armed Forces (Lord Trefgarne)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with your Lordships' permission, I should like to make a personal statement.<lb/>
I very much regret that I inadvertently misled your Lordships last night in replying to the Unstarred Question of the noble Baroness, Lady Burton of Coventry, on airline competition. I told your Lordships that airline tickets to the United States, sold on the basis of lower unapproved winter fares, were not valid and passengers would have to buy new tickets at the higher approved fares. I now understand that Ministers decided yesterday that these tickets bought before 18th October, when the Government decided not to approve the lower fares, will, after all, remain valid. I was not aware of this decision when I spoke as I did last evening, and I apologise to your Lordships unreservedly.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02273"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02274">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02275">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they are aware of the circumstances in which the BBC decided to dispense with the services of Mr. David Dimbleby as a reporter at this year's party conferences; and whether these circumstances cause the Government any concern.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02276"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is not for the Government to comment on the contractual relationship between the BBC and a particular individual.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02277"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that Answer, but only moderately. Is it not ironic that the Government should say that they cannot intervene in the relations between the BBC and its employees, whereas the case of Mr. David Dimbleby indicates very clearly that there are other people who can interfere in this way? Is it not outrageous that the BBC should have been dictated to on the question of which reporters it should send to cover party conferences? Would it not have been proper for the Director General of the BBC to tell those who said that Mr. Dimbleby was not acceptable that in that case they would not report the conferences at all? Is this not an outrageous case of interference with the freedom of the press?</membercontribution></p>
<col>514</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02278"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the Government's employment Acts provide civil remedies in a case such as this, but it is for those whose businesses are affected to decide when it would be appropriate to invoke them, and not for the Government to direct them. The only other reply I would make to the noble Lord is to remind him that the BBC was prepared to go to the High Court to get an injunction against the disruption of the Budget programmes, which is a related issue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02279"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, can the Minister say whether the person mentioned in the Question has had anything taken up with the BBC on his behalf by a trade union or professional organisation apropos his complaint as voiced by the noble Lord?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02280"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in a difficult position in that it is not the Government's responsibility to conduct the relations of the BBC with somebody with whom it has a contractual relationship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02281"><member>Lord Orr-Ewing</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, will my noble friend bear in mind that when trade unions interfere with editorial freedom in the printing of a newspaper there is generally an announcement of that fact? Fortunately, it has been drawn attention to in this House. I wonder whether some publicity ought not be given by the BBC when its editorial freedom is challenged by what amounts to secondary blacking.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02282"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sure that that is a view of which the BBC will take note when it is published.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02283"><member>Lord Chalfont</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that he has not really answered my Question? My Question was: are the Government aware of the circumstances, and, if so, do they cause the Government any concern? I am not suggesting that the Government should have intervened or directed in any way. My question is: does the fact that a journalist has been deprived of the right to pursue his profession because of the pressure of a political organisation cause the Government any concern? Will the noble Lord please answer that question?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02284"><member>Lord Elton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, specifically, the Government are aware of the circumstances. As to the way in which the corporation handled those circumstances, I have to repeat that that is a matter for the corporation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02288">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether, in view of the answer given on 14th June (col. 1252), they are able to give further details of the progress made on the review by the European Air Navigation Planning Group of the air route structure.</p>

provisional plan for improvements in route alignment is likely to be endorsed by the full ICAO Council by April next year. However, in advance of ICAO's formal approval the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Ireland and Spain have already established new routes reflecting operators' requirements.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02290"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that after what must seem interminable Questions it is rather nice to end the Session in thanking the noble Lord for the help that he has given on this matter? But having said that, would the Minister not agree that it seems an interminable time since this matter was referred to the International Civil Aviation Organisation? If I am correct, I believe it was referred in May; and does the noble Lord recall that in June he told me that they had still not had time to discuss the matter? I understand that they are meeting in Montreal at the present moment. Can the noble Lord say whether waiting until next year means that the routes affected will not be in a cost-saving position as it has not actually become law?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02291"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, no, that is not so. I am happy to be able to say that a number of improvements along the lines proposed by the planning group are being brought into effect straightaway. For example, a Dublin-London route has been established; a Dublin-Cherbourg peninsula route has been established; and also a Dublin-Santiago route has been established, all of which shorten the original routings and will provide economies for airlines as a result.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02292"><member>Baroness Burton of Coventry</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord will be kind enough to let me know next year when this has finally been settled, so that we might have a Question down and end the matter once and for all.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Water: Waste by Leakage</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02294">2.37 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02295"><member>Lord Molson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02296">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02297">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they accept that between 25&#x2013;30 per cent, of water, valued at &#x00A3;45 million, is being wasted annually by leakage; and if so, what steps are being taken to remedy this before the next drought, and whether Exchequer assistance will be given.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02298"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the percentage and value of water put into supply which is unaccounted for, principally because of leakage, vary widely from place to place. A survey in 1977 put this figure at approximately 24 per cent. for the United Kingdom as a whole. However, in some areas the figure can be much higher.<lb/>
<col>516</col>
Water authorities and companies have adopted policies for detecting and controlling leakage which concentrate effort on places where the value of the water saved justifies the costs incurred. Recently-developed equipment to prevent excess pressures in water mains is proving to be particularly successful in reducing leakage. This is now coming into wide use.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02299"><member>Lord Molson</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while thanking my noble friend for that Answer, which as far as it goes seems to be encouraging, may I ask him two relevant supplementary questions? Was it known before the beginning of the drought that there was this serious problem of leakage from the mains and from water pipes? Secondly, since the whole financial policy of the water authorities is strictly controlled by the Secretary of State, can we be assured that water authorities will be allowed sufficient freedom in obtaining money to carry out the necessary repairs to these mains? Do the Government agree that it is preferable for money to be spent on maintaining the essential infrastructure of the country rather than for it to be spent on unemployment?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02300"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, there are about 180,000 miles of undertakers' mains, and a similar length of supply pipes in the ownership of consumers in England and Wales. Therefore, there will always be a certain amount of leakage. What one has to ascertain is at what point it ceases to become cost-effective to repair this leakage. As to my noble friend's question on the budget of water authorities, yes, the budget is approved in each case by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State; and for those procedures which the water authorities themselves wish to carry out there is sufficient money.<lb/>
My noble friend's last point was about the relative cost of improving the water mains system of this country vis-a-vis paying unemployment benefit. I do not think that the two are relative because if extra manpower were to be used on this it would rapidly become a non-cost-effective situation so that I think it would be a short-term saving on unemployment, even assuming that the people on the unemployed registers were qualified to carry out the work in the first place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02301"><member>Lord Bruce of Donington</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that his answers to the very serious and important questions put to him by the noble Lord, Lord Molson, were thoroughly unsatisfactory? Is the noble Lord aware that it is vitally necessary at this time, not only in relief of unemployment but on its strict financial, economic cost-effective basis, for the Government to pull their finger out and see that a proper investment is made in this very important part of the nation's infrastructure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02302"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships' Select Committee on Science and Technology in 1982 reported on the future of the water industry and took up in some detail this question of water leakage. I would refer the noble Lord to what they say and to what was the Government's response. The Government have been in contact with the water authorities to set under way new and improved measures to reduce water leakage and these are being
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0267"/>
<col>517</col>
taken forward. So in the noble Lord's phrase, I do not think that it is a question of the Government not pulling their finger out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02303"><member>Lord Tordoff</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is it not more a question of the Government putting their finger in rather than pulling it out?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02304"><member>Lord Maude of Stratford-upon-Avon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, while this system is obviously a pretty uneconomic way of transporting water, is it really true to say that all this water is being wasted? Apart from burst water mains in built-up areas where water is lost through storm drains, surely the leakage from underground pipes is absorbed into the ground and goes to replenish the water table?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02305"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish that that were entirely so. But of course there is an uptake by plants; and it finds its way into rivers and so down into the sea. It also finds its way into ponds and it is lost through evaporation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02306"><member>Lord Dean of Beswick</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does not the Minister agree that the interests of the water authorities would be far better served by opening up their meetings to the press, the public and the media instead of insisting upon meeting in secret and in camera as they do at present?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02307"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, that is a totally different question. However, even if I agreed, I would have to say that there is now a perfect mechanism for the press to get any information they require out of the water authorities.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02308"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that the water authorities in the past few years have most impressively developed techniques for surveying the mains water supplies without digging up the roads? They use various methods such as radar screens, and so on; and they have television cameras actually placed in the mains. Thus they have been able to work out techniques for repairing and re-lining mains <i>in situ</i>, which is greatly to the benefit of the economy for they do not have to dig up and replace the system. Massive progress has been made and the water authorities should be given some credit for the progress that they have made in this fashion. While it is true that they could make even more progress if they had the money to enable them to carry out more service and repairs, they have achieved a very great deal in this particular respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02309"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend. He is quite right. The Water Research Centre has been at the centre of producing the new machines such as the leak/noise correlator to which my noble friend has referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02310"><member>Lord Mishcon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, have not the Government a rather bad record in controlling leakages?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02311"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it depends upon whether they are H<sub>2</sub>0 or other materials.</membercontribution></p>
<col>518</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02312"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in view of the heat in the supplementary question put from the Front Bench opposite, are we to understand that that leakage has only taken place over the past five years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02313"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am sorry but my noble friend has totally lost me.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02314"><member>Lord Harmar-Nicholls</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I put my supplementary question again? Has the leakage which has been admitted on all sides taken place only during the period of the Conservative administration?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02315"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for spelling out his supplementary question. No, my Lords, leakage has always gone on and always will go on.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02316"><member>Lord Avebury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Government's failure to invest more in water resources accounted for by problems of liquidity?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02317"><member>Lord Leatherland</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does the Minister recall that in his original Answer, he used the expression "non-effective cost situation"? Can he please tell me what it means?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02318"><member>Lord Skelmersdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in my terminology, non-effective cost is something that, if you spend it, does not actually do any good.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Coal Mining Industry: Future Development</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02319">2.47 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02320"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02321">The Question was as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02322">To ask Her Majesty's Government whether they will establish a specialist committee of geological and mining engineers to ascertain the future of British coal mines.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02323"><member>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Lord Gray of Contin)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the National Coal Board, which is statutorily responsible for the efficient development of the coal mining industry of this country, has made positive and constructive proposals for the industry's future. These proposals have been accepted by the industry's trade unions with the exception of the National Union of Mineworkers. It is the view of many miners themselves that the NUM should also now accept those proposals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02324"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I thank the Minister for that quite irrelevant reply? The fact of the matter is that there is a most massive strike going on at this very moment which any sensible person would want to see come to an end. That was the purpose of my Question, and not in any way (would the noble Lord agree?) do I wish to apportion blame in one way or the other. But with an independent committee that was answerable neither to the NUM or NACODS nor to the National Coal Board, their findings would give encouragement to miners and, indeed, to the specialists in the National Coal Board. What I am talking
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0268"/>
<col>519</col>
about, and what I am asking the Minister to be serious about, is the future of a vital part of British industry; namely, its coal reserves and coal supplies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02325"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can assure the noble Lord that I have never been more serious about anything; but the National Coal Board did make clear to the conciliation service and the mining unions its readiness to give full weight to the advice of an independent advisory body appointed to consider disputed proposals under the colliery review procedure. But it would be completely unreasonable for anybody to expect the board to relinquish its responsibility for managing the coal industry. The staff of the National Coal Board are expert in the geological and mining engineering questions which affect the coal industry, and they are dealing with them on a day-to-day basis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02326"><member>Lord Stoddart of Swindon</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, does my noble friend's Question not have added relevance in that he wants an independent body to study these matters, bearing in mind the document marked "Secret" which was issued by the north-east area today, which is referred to in the national newspapers and which in fact projects a run-down of the coal industry in the north-east with a loss of 5,500 jobs by 1988 and another 12,000 by the 1990s? Does that not show that while the NACODS negotiations were going on there were already secret plans going ahead to close down, or virtually to close down, the north-east area; and was that not really treachery?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02327"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am really amazed at a parliamentarian with the experience of the noble Lord making a statement of that sort from the Dispatch Box. Mr. MacGregor, as chairman, has made the miners the best offer in the industry's history: a generous pay award, a guaranteed job for those wishing to stay in the industry, generous assistance for those transferring to other jobs or leaving the industry, massive investment in the coal industry's future, and an enterprise scheme to help bring new jobs to mining areas. If Mr. Scargill had the real interests of his miners at heart he would accept the board's remarkably good offer, as other mining unions have already done, and stop scare-mongering.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02328"><member>Viscount Massereene and Ferrard</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that every tonne of coal mined in this country costs the taxpayer &#x00A3;60, in other words, &#x00A3;3,000 million a year and in fact it could be imported at &#x00A3;30 a tonne?&#x2014;not that I would advise that, but I should just like to point it out. If only Mr. Scargill would behave himself and allow this procedure of closing uneconomic mines to go through we would then probably have a viable coal industry which would save, as I said, the taxpayer &#x00A3;3,000 million a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02329"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his observations, which of course are accurate, but it is no part of the Government's intention to do other than give wholehearted support to the coal industry; and indeed the steps which my honourable and right honourable friends have taken since 1979 have wholly committed them to this. It is
<col>520</col>
at times difficult, when the National Coal Board finds that it has to negotiate with somebody who to all intents and purposes is more interested in the political outcome of the dispute than in the real interests of his members.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02330"><member>Lord Campbell of Alloway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would my noble friend the Minister agree that the form of the Question, quite rightly, in no way seeks to canvass the merits of the miners' dispute and that the Question is a serious one? Would he agree that the future of the mines is dependent upon productivity, price, demand and also upon a predictable supply?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02331"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes, I could not disagree with anything that my noble friend has said. I think his assessment of the situation is accurate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02332"><member>Baroness Gaitskell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the Minister aware that Mr. MacGregor has never been generous to the miners from the word "Go" and we cannot expect things from him?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02333"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I respect the view of the noble Baroness of course, but I think that if she will do her research and read precisely what has been put on offer to the miners, she will find that the statement which I have made this afternoon is absolutely correct.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02334"><member>Lord Renton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is my noble friend aware that many coal-faces have been damaged&#x2014;some of them perhaps permanently, all of them temporarily&#x2014;by flooding, by underground fires and by a falling in of underground roadways and that all of these damaged coal-faces will cost a great deal of money to put into order again? Is this a factor which, so far as he is aware, is being borne in mind in the further negotiations with regard to this strike?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02335"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think my noble friend will realise that those factors are well known to both sides who are negotiating. The actual up-to-date figures are that 20 producing faces have already been lost and a further 84 faces are causing serious concern at collieries throughout the British coalfields. This is a very serious situation and one which many working miners will be appalled about when they realise the potential consequences. I am sure that everybody on this side, and I am sure on both sides, hopes that the negotiations which are taking place today can be concluded satisfactorily and that Mr. Scargill will appreciate the benefit of what he is being offered, set aside his political views, and settle on the facts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02336"><member>The Earl of Halsbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with reference to the Question on the Order Paper, would the noble Lord agree that we already have an independent source of authority, the Institute of Geological Sciences? Would he further agree that where it and the coal board do not always see eye to eye with regard to reserves, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, it would be quite impossible to find any third body so much more authoritative than either of them that its ajudication could be accepted?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02337"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I have made it absolutely clear that the National Coal Board is
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0269"/>
<col>521</col>
prepared to give full weight to the advice of an independent advisory body appointed to consider disputed proposals under the colliery review procedures; but I think also we must realise that the National Coal Board is statutorily responsible for the management of coalfields, and for it to devolve this power would be quite wrong. It has fully indicated that it is agreeable to taking due note of any recommendation, but the final decision must be for those who manage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02338"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, may I say that the real purpose of my Question was this? At some time this awful dispute will end. What we have to do is to find something which is not there yet which could prevent this situation from ever happening again. Arbitrators and referees do not really count. My proposal was that there should be geologists and mining engineers, not on the side of the NCB, who have the right to govern and run the pits, and not on the side of the National Union of Mineworkers, who have the right to look after their members, but who with their experience as geologists and mining engineers could quite easily make a fantastic contribution to prevent anything like this from happening again. May I say this to the Minister. We had the coal industry examination and final report in 1974, we had the <i>Plan for Coal</i> in 1977, and we have now had established a miscellaneous one hundred and one set of Ministers. Nothing seems to be resolving this. All I would plead and ask is this&#x2014;&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02339"><member>Noble Lords</member><membercontribution>: Order, order!</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02340"><member>Lord Molloy</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, all I would ask is this: will the Government give consideration to my recommendation to end the dispute and to prevent it from ever happening again?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02341"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, so far every move which has taken place towards a solution&#x2014;every move, every concession&#x2014;has been made by the National Coal Board. So far there is no evidence whatsoever that Mr. Scargill is prepared to concede one iota. Therefore, I reiterate to the noble Lord that what he asks for in his Question the National Coal Board is prepared to some degree to accede to. It is prepared to take due note of advice of a body such as the noble Lord suggests. But I would reiterate that the ultimate management must be in the hands of those who manage&#x2014;and that is the National Coal Board.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02342"><member>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, would not my noble friend agree that the questions of the noble Lord opposite are a marvellous example of the way in which hope continues to triumph over experience, in that he evidently believes that some special wisdom might emanate from a specialist committee, while all experience teaches that such bodies only confuse counsel?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02343"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I take note of the comments of my noble friend but, to stick as closely as I can to the terms of the noble Lord's Question, I have indicated that the coal board would be prepared to take on board the view of any such body but that theirs must be the ultimate decision.</membercontribution></p>
<col>522</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02344"><member>Lord Paget of Northampton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is not the trouble here that we have had terms offered which could, and almost certainly would, have been accepted if they had not come from sources which have made themselves utterly distrusted, and that the kind of answers we have been getting from the Minister simply increases that distrust and makes acceptance less and less likely?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02345"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I would remind the noble Lord that one union has already negotiated and reached a settlement on terms which it considers to be fair to both sides. If the National Union of Mineworkers would adopt a similar approach the whole question of the strike would be resolved today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02346"><member>Lord Wallace of Coslany</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, is the noble Lord the Minister aware that he and many other people would be well advised to take personalities out of this? Is he further aware that instead of making reference to "Scargill" and "MacGregor" it would be far better to refer to the NUM and the National Coal Board in this dispute?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02347"><member>Lord Gray of Contin</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am afraid that the attitude of Mr. Scargill in this dispute, and particularly of some of those from whom he has sought counsel, makes it very difficult to keep personalities out of this.</membercontribution></p>

The House will have listened with interest to what the noble Lord, Lord Gray of Contin, has said, but will he answer this question? Will he confirm that while negotiations were going on with NACODS a secret document was in preparation, and was about to be published, which would reduce the number of men in the north-east coalfields by 12,000? Will he confirm that?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02353"><member>Lord Nugent of Guildford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, before my noble friend replies, may I ask him whether he is aware that if the Government Chief Whip has advice to give it is usually within the courtesies of this House to hearit?</membercontribution></p>

<title>Human Fertilisation: Warnock Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02366">3.4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02367"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health and Social Security (Lord Glenarthur)</member> rose to move, That this House takes note of the report of the Committee of inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology (the Warnock Report) (Cmnd. 9314).</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02368">The noble Lord said: My Lords, 1978 saw the birth in this county of a child described as the world's first test-tube baby. For some couples this was a major breakthrough because it offered the only method by which they might have a child which would be genetically their own. Alongside the wonder this caused and the hopes it raised, there grew understandable concern and some disquiet about where this new technology might lead. There then also grew a belief that the issues were wider than those of medical ethics; so wide, in fact, that they should be subject to the scrutiny of society as a whole. So it was that in 1982 the Government established this inquiry whose report is before us today. The <i>Official Report</i> for 9th July 1982 reports a request for such a measure from the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun. I am glad to see that she is in her place today.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02369">Let me say a few words about the committee of inquiry. It was chaired by Dame Mary Warnock, and its membership reflected a wide range of lay, professional and religious interests. The terms of reference given to it were to consider what policies and safeguards should be applied to recent and potential developments in human fertilisation and embryology, and to make recommendations. This the inquiry has now done. The Government welcome the clarity of the report, as I think do most who have read it, and the balanced way in which the challenges posed by the new treatments and associated research have been presented. I should like to record the Government's sincere appreciation to Dame Mary and to her team for the care and concern which they brought to this formidable task. They produced a report of major importance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02370">The Warnock report concerns the social, ethical and legal implications of developments in human reproduction. These are complex and sensitive matters. As the foreword to the report says:
<quote>"it would be idle to pretend that there is not a wide diversity in moral feelings, whether these arise from religious, philosophical or humanist beliefs. What is common &#x2026; is that people generally want <i>some principles or other</i> to govern the development and use of the new techniques. There must be <i>some</i> barriers that are not to be crossed, <i>some</i> limits fixed, beyond which people must not be allowed to go".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02371">The foreword goes on to say:
<quote>"We realise that some people may think that we have set the limits, or have suggested that the barriers be erected, in the wrong places. But at least we hope that we have stated clearly what we think should be done, and exposed, as far as possible, the reasoning that lay behind our recommendations".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02372">The Government published the committee's report without delay because we considered it of the utmost importance to make the discussion it contains, and its recommendations, widely available. At the same time, we sent it to a wide range of interested organisations
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0271"/>
<col>525</col>
for comment by the end of the year. We hope all those organisations, and members of the general public, who wish to comment will make their views known to us.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02373">We believe it would have been wrong to rush ahead with hasty decisions about how to take forward the recommendations contained in the report. We felt that a period of consultation was required in order to consider it fully. In moving this Motion, your Lordships will understand that it is not my purpose to announce decisions today. But it is appropriate that the views of your Lordships should be taken account of in this consultative process. The list of speakers is impressive, and we shall all benefit from the wise counsels which will be given from the Bishops' Benches and from noble Lords experienced in law, in medicine and the sciences, and in the many other matters which bear deeply on our society. At the end of the debate I shall of course respond where I can to points that will have been raised.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02374">We have been presented with more than 60 recommendations for legislative or administrative change. I will highlight only the key proposals. These are, that there should be a statutory body to license and inspect all infertility services where the new techniques are used, and the use of human embryos in research. This body would also provide on-going advice to Government about future developments and ensure that criteria for good practice in infertility services were implemented. Secondly, that in addition to control by the proposed statutory body the use of human embryos in research must be strictly regulated by law. In particular, there should be an absolute limit of 14 days after fertilisation after which embryos may not be further developed; and it should be made a criminal offence to undertake certain types of research and procedures; for example, the transfer of a human embryo to the uterus of another species. Then that surrogate motherhood treatment, whether provided by agencies or individual doctors, should be banned; and that the legal status and interests of the children born as a result of AID or IVF should be secured. In particular, the AID child should be legitimised.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02375">There is no doubt that many of the issues in this report will arouse strong and widely differing opinions. Indeed, among the public at large they are already doing so. There will not be a consensus view on all recommendations. The members of the committee were divided in their view on certain aspects of research and on surrogacy. It is for this reason that the Government have set a period for public debate and for consultation with interested organisations, which will continue until the end of this year. We are already considering the report very closely. We shall take careful account of all the views expressed, including those of your Lordships, before we reach decisions. My Lords, I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02376">Moved, That this House takes note of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology (the Warnock Report) (Cmnd. 9314).&#x2014;(<i>Lord Glenarthur.)</i></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02377">3.10 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02378"><member>Lord Ennals</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at the start of this very important debate, let me make it quite clear that though I am speaking from the Opposition Front Bench, nothing that I say is other than my own
<col>526</col>
personal view. There is no party line, nor should there be at this stage of the debate on a subject raising such profound moral and ethical issues, and I am sure that the noble Lord the Minister was quite right to say that his task is to listen and that he will do so. The number of Members of your Lordships' House who are to speak today is an indication of the very widespread interest. However, we cannot escape the fact&#x2014;and the committee presided over the Dame Mary Warnock believes this&#x2014;that some decisions are urgently needed; of course after careful consideration. The Government themselves will have to make up their minds and introduce legislation for consideration by both Houses.<lb/>
Before coming to the report, I want to say that the subject is one that has interested me personally over a number of years as a result of continuing involvement with the National Association for the Childless. Those who are fortunate enough to know the joys of having the presence of children in the home, and of seeing their children grow into mature, and in my case&#x2014;and I am certain that it applies to many other noble Lords&#x2014;outstandingly able adults, should not ignore for one moment the frustration and sense of deprivation of those couples who want to have children, but who, through reasons of infertility, are unable to do so.<lb/>
In fact, the right to bear children is one of those human rights written into the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Some people do not realise that about 10 per cent. of marriages in the United Kingdom are still childless after 10 years and only a small proportion of those are childless by their own wish. The vast majority of childless couples long for a child or children and are denied them through no fault of their own. It is for them a source of profound sadness, often carrying with it the implications of inadequacy. It is not surprising therefore that, as a result of the remarkable medical skills of Mr. Patrick Steptoe and Dr. Robert Edwards, the birth of the first test-tube baby in July 1978, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, was not only hailed as a truly remarkable achievement but it held out new hope to infertile couples.<lb/>
As the Warnock report on human fertilisation states in its very first paragraph:
<quote>"The technique, long sought, at last successful, opened up new horizons in the alleviation of infertility and in the science of embryology. It was now possible to observe the very earliest stages of human development, and with these discoveries came the hope of remedying defects at this very early stage. However there were also anxieties. There was a sense that events were moving too fast for their implications to be assimilated. Society's views on the new techniques were divided between pride in the technological achievement, pleasure at the new-found means to relieve, at least for some, the unhappiness of infertility, and unease at the apparently uncontrolled advance of science, bringing with it new possibilities for manipulating the early stages of human development".</quote>
I had an opportunity of discussing these issues with Mr. Steptoe and Dr. Edwards at a conference of the National Association for the Childless, and subsequently with Dame Mary Warnock after the report was published. I should like to pay a very warm tribute to Dame Mary, as chairman of the committee, and to the laymen, doctors, scientists and theologians who served on the committee. In general, and repeating that I am speaking personally, I find the arguments persuasive and the conclusions sound.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0272"/>
<col>527</col>
It is of more than passing interest that the Central Ethical Committee of the BMA in their report in 1983 reached almost identical conclusions. Of the Warnock Committee's report, they said on 18th July this year:
<quote>"This is a brilliant report which records the anxieties many people feel about the work carried out by doctors at the frontiers of medicine. The conclusions will provide sensible and compassionate guidance for the introduction of laws so that we can achieve the greatest benefits from the techniques available with as few of the undesirable consequences as possible."</quote>
So after careful thought and weighing up the natural concerns, such as those that will undoubtedly be expressed by a number of your Lordships today, but conscious also of the great joy that may be provided for some eager and loving couples now denied the God-given gift of children, I conclude that a statutory authority to license test-tube baby research and treatment, to control research on human embryos and to licence other treatment for infertility should be set up as soon as is reasonably possible. Research on human embryos should be limited to 14 days after fertilisation, and beyond that should be a criminal offence. The sale or purchase of human embryos, semen and eggs should be permitted only under licence from the authority. Research would have to be licensed, project by project, and legal changes should be introduced to make children bom by artificial insemination or by egg or embryo donation legitimate. Remarkably, the committee agreed unanimously on 63 recommendations, with all of which I personally&#x2014;and I repeat again, personally&#x2014;also agree.<lb/>
Perhaps the most controversial issue is that of surrogate motherhood, on which I also share the doubts expressed not only by the committee itself but by the founder of the National Association for the Childless, Mr. Peter Houghton. It poses many problems. The first is whether it is right for one woman to donate her baby to another. If a money transaction takes place, then a sale has effectively taken place and the surrogate womb has been used for gain. I suspect that most people will feel that there is something deeply wrong about a process of this kind, particularly if money is involved. It appears to be to do with the kind of value that we place on human life; for example, not treating it as a mere commodity. Others argue that for the surrogate to expose herself to the experience of loss after a successful pregnancy is deeply unwise. Still others accuse the childless couple of selfish exploitation of other women just to have a baby of their own. In other words, what is required to obtain the baby by this means is too great when measured against the prospect of childlessness.<lb/>
Have the childless couple understood that they themselves will be exposed to grief, loss and humiliation in the quite natural and possible event that the experience of pregnancy and child birth may persuade the mother to retain the child? If a money transaction is involved, do they realise that they would have no enforceable contract and could not recover it? Moreover, the surrogate mother might die during the pregnancy, or the child might be born disabled and be rejected by the couple. On this issue, too, I support strongly the conclusion of the majority of the committee&#x2014;there was of course a minority
<col>528</col>
report&#x2014;that surrogate motherhood agencies should be banned. As the Warnock Committee says:
<quote>"There must be some barriers that are not to be crossed, some limits fixed".</quote>
The report has attempted to produce a coherent set of proposals for how public policy rather than individual conscience should respond to a range of developments in which many people will not wish to participate but which others find entirely acceptable. For a balanced approach, upon which there will be deep debate not only in your Lordships' House but in another place and throughout the country, certainly among those of religious belief, I believe that this report has provided the basis for precisely the kind of ethical, moral and legal discussion which needs to take place. For this we are greatly in debt to Dame Mary Warnock and her committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02379">3.22 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02380"><member>Lord Winstanley</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as has already been said, we are debating a matter which raises questions of immense moral, ethical, religious and philosophical significance but not, I hope, for the moment at least, of party political significance. It therefore follows that, like the noble Lord, Lord Ennals, in what I say today in this debate I am not expressing a party line. My noble friends are entirely free to hold their own opinions and to express them, if they so choose.<lb/>
In general terms, we on these Benches have always believed that the search for knowledge&#x2014;of ourselves and of the world in which we live&#x2014;should, where possible, be assisted and should not needlessly be obstructed. We also believe that people should be free to do anything that they wish to do, provided that what they do does not impinge on the safety, rights or freedom of others. But in the context of this report, who are the "others"? Is the human embryo before implantation to rank as one of the others, with the entitlement to rights and protection which legal recognition would necessarily imply? That is the kind of question which Dame Mary Warnock and her colleagues invite us to consider, though not necessarily to answer.<lb/>
In our House we are not obliged to answer unanswerable questions, nor are we obliged here and now to judge between the merits of two extreme and opposing groups who believe that they already know the answers with absolute certainty: the one group which says, and will continue to say, that anything goes and the other group which insists, and will doubtless go on insisting, that nothing at all should be done.<lb/>
Judging from the admirable and wholly appropriately brief speech of the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, this debate is not for the purpose of coming to finite conclusions. It is an occasion for careful thought, for ventilating our thoughts and for listening carefully to, and considering the thoughts of, others. In my opinion, both professionally and as a doctor, I believe that we would be very unwise to try to legislate precipitately in an area in which the rate of technological change is now so very rapid that any new legislation, by the time it reaches the statute book, might inevitably become out of date and even be overtaken by events.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0273"/>
<col>529</col>
Just think, as we have already been reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Ennals, and the noble Lord, Lord Glenarthur, for a moment of the complexity of the matters which Dame Mary asks us to consider: AIH, which is now fairly generally regarded as acceptable; AID, which is much more controversial; egg donation, which is highly controversial, and embryo donation and surrogacy which are rather more than controversial. The right of a human being born by these means to have some ultimate right to a knowledge of his or her genetic inheritance is a very important matter which needs to be considered, as is the use of human embryos in research.<lb/>
The remote and, to me, alarming possibility of parthenogenesis and of the virgin birth, which is what parthenogenesis really is, may take place naturally, but we have to consider whether it should be artificially assisted to take place. There is the possibility of cloning and even the horrifying possibility of trans-species fertilisation and the gestation of human embryos in other species&#x2014;matters which no one in his right mind would regard as acceptable and which should be forbidden.<lb/>
All that I have said is not merely to demonstrate that I have read and studied the report with immense care, but to illustrate, as others have already illustrated, the immense complexity of the subject with which we have to deal.<lb/>
Briefly, why do we have to deal with it at all? What is the point of work of this kind and what benefits could possibly flow to mankind from all this work? Let me spend a moment upon giving my answers to those questions. First, the relief of infertility and subfertility is a very important matter, but in a world in which the human population, in global terms, is now growing at a rate of 8,000 an hour&#x2014;perhaps another Wolverhampton by the time this debate is over&#x2014;surely we should think carefully before adding needlessly to that population.<lb/>
I am bound to say that while I recognise the burden of childlessness and the right of a couple to be assisted to have a child, I am not enamoured of a technology which can now give six or seven children to a couple at one fell swoop. The incidental and accidental production of multiple pregnancies needs to be very carefully watched. On the other hand, some of the research into human fertilisation which is now being carried out and which is referred to in the report may later prove helpful in preventing pregnancy for those couples who wish to prevent it but who are opposed, on religious grounds or other kinds of fastidiousness, to mechanical or other methods and who now rely upon the so-called safe period. I am sure your Lordships know what some doctors call those who prefer to use the safe period method of contraception. We call them parents. We believe that this research could prove beneficial in that particular direction.<lb/>
Let me turn briefly to the increasing prevalence in our society of genetically transmitted diseases. In a sense, modern civilisation has taken evolution, Darwinism&#x2014;the survival of the fittest&#x2014;by the scruff of the neck and put it into reverse. We rightly make sure not only that the least fit survive, but that they grow up and multiply. The net result is a steady increase in the incidence of a number of genetically transmitted
<col>530</col>
diseases. Genetic counselling can, and indeed does, assist considerably, but we need more knowledge. It is in part to gain more knowledge that this work is taking place. If we had more knowledge of this kind, genetic counselling could do a great deal more. It should, in my view, be allowed and assisted to continue.<lb/>
Looking for a moment at the more grotesque possibilities in the remote future of eugenic techniques to improve the innate quality of mankind, which depends rather more upon genetic than upon environmental factors, we are on very dangerous ground indeed. But it cannot be denied that upon any impartial examination of the world today the human experiment does not seem to have been an outstanding success.<lb/>
There is a widespread and rather naive assumption that as long as time keeps passing, humanity will inevitably get better and better. In my view, that assumption is not wholly supported by the facts. Personally, I entertain hopes that some day we may even be superseded and replaced by a better and more agreeable species&#x2014;but I have no doubt that some would regard that as a form of heresy. If a genetically-transmitted quality such as aggression could be bred out of us, that might be no bad thing&#x2014;but we must not start trying to behave or think as if we were God. We are a very long way indeed from that stage of development.<lb/>
Let us proceed rapidly to set up the recommended statutory authority to regulate and watch over all these worrying matters, and let us restrict work in this field to those licensed by the authority to undertake such work and to do so within the very sensible guidelines laid down in the report. In other words, I am endorsing the view already expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Ennals. All that would require minimal legislation.<lb/>
On certain of the other matters, let us proceed cautiously and without haste. The law in this field is already in something of a muddle. We have a legal point of viability of a human foetus and all the consequences that flow therefrom. We now have a measure of legal protection for the human embryo <i>in vivo</i>, and we must now proceed in some way to protect the human embryo which is not <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, we must consider very carefully the legal rights of the child that is born as a result of these new techniques. I am less concerned about the rights of fully consenting adults&#x2014;be they husbands or wives, fathers or mothers, or third parties. I believe that the majority report has got those things just about right.<lb/>
Finally, some words of thanks from all noble Lords on these Benches to Dame Mary Warnock and all her colleagues and helpers for an invaluable, wise, and very perceptive review of a field of medical science about which opinions differ widely and will continue to differ widely. I grow a little tired of the fact that whenever a Royal Commission or a committee of inquiry, which may have sat for something like five years, publishes its report, the leader writers of the press&#x2014;and sometimes, Front Bench spokesmen on both sides of both Houses of Parliament&#x2014;are able to offer us all the answers instantaneously. One wonders why anyone bothered to appoint a Royal Commission or a committee of inquiry at all. The answer is that we must think a great deal more.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0274"/>
<col>531</col>
I personally can see no prospect of total unanimity in Parliament or outside it on these many matters. For the moment therefore let us proceed slowly, think further and more deeply, and refrain from jumping in with legislation to ban things until we are much more sure of what we are doing.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Mrs. Gandhi: Assassination</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02381">3.33 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02382"><member>The Lord President of the Council (Viscount Whitelaw)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement that is being made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister about Mrs. Gandhi. The Statement is as follows:<lb/>
"As the House will be aware, Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated in Delhi today. I am sure that honourable Members on all sides of the House will be equally appalled at this tragic news. I am sure too that the whole House will wish to join in expressing to Mrs. Gandhi's family, and to the Government and people of India our profound grief and our sympathy.<lb/>
"This despicable act has robbed India of a great and courageous leader. Daughter of Pandit Nehru, one of the pioneers of India's independence, she led her country for a total of 16 years as Prime Minister, a period which saw India's emergence as an industrial power as well as a major influence in world affairs. Her death has also robbed the Commonwealth of a statesman of outstanding stature and experience. She chaired the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in November last year with dignity, authority and charm.<lb/>
"We shall all feel the loss of her wise counsel and her deep humanity&#x2014;the more so because we knew her not only as a statesman but as a friend of this country. I understand, although it is not yet confirmed officially, that Mrs. Gandhi's son, Rajiv Gandhi, whom we know well and for whom we have both affection and respect, has been sworn in as the new Indian Prime Minister. We wish him well at this difficult hour in his country's history.<lb/>
"Only a few days ago, Mrs. Gandhi sent me a message in which she said, 'All terrorism and violence are condemnable and contemptible'. The murder of a democratic leader is an attack on democracy itself. We utterly condemn this savage and treacherous crime. Let there be no doubt that acts of terrorism will only strengthen the resolve of free peoples that those who resort to violence shall never prevail".<lb/>
My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02383"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Viscount for repeating the Prime Minister's admirable Statement. We join him in sending our greatest sympathy to Mrs. Gandhi's family and to the Government and people of India on their great and terrible loss. Those of us who have known Mrs. Gandhi will have felt a sense of personal loss today. All of us will have felt diminished by her
<col>532</col>
death. She was dedicated, unostentatious, and a lady of great courage. She strove to hold the Indian subcontinent together and to weld it into a single nation&#x2014;and she sustained it as the world's largest parliamentary democracy.<lb/>
As the Prime Minister's Statement said, Mrs. Gandhi was a friend of this country. Her chairmanship over the Commonwealth conference last year was a measure of her support of the Commonwealth, where she was held in the highest esteem. She was also leader of the third force in the world. Her death is indeed a world tragedy.<lb/>
We join with the Prime Minister in wishing Mrs. Gandhi's son and her successor well. No country has more historic links with India than our own and we feel a deep sense of sympathy and understanding with its people today. We, too, join with the Prime Minister in condemning the savage and treacherous crime which killed Mrs. Gandhi. Our resolve to combat terrorism and violence will be strengthened by this dreadful experience.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02384"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I shall try&#x2014;though I know I will fail&#x2014;to express something of the deep sadness and shock that overwhelms every one of us on these Benches. This act of blind violence has come at a time when we need no reminding in this country that this madness is abroad and that no free society can defend itself completely against it. This act of violence has happened in a country of deep and ancient civilisation, where every man and woman has before them the knowledge that whereas violence has never persuaded anybody, determined non-violence has succeeded in moving mountains.<lb/>
We send to the family of this great leader and great lady our deepest sympathy. We send to her son not only our sympathy but also our profound wishes that he will be successful in the onerous task that he is now undertaking, and&#x2014;above all&#x2014;that the violence which has taken place will not generate further violence. We thank the Leader of the House for repeating the Prime Minister's Statement, with every word of which we agree&#x2014;and we echo its sentiments completely. But the noble Viscount must know that this Statement is one which we all deeply desired never&#x2014;but never&#x2014;to hear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02385"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, and the noble Lord, Lord Diamond, for what they have said. They have expressed most eloquently the feelings of, I believe, the whole House and the unity of the whole House at this moment. There is nothing that can add to their words and it would be wrong of me to attempt to do it better than they have because they have done it so magnificently for all of us.<lb/>
Perhaps I may just say that I agreed so much with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, when he referred to the personal loss that many of us who knew Mrs. Gandhi feel at this time. There are many noble Lords in this House who knew Mrs. Gandhi better than I did, but from my knowledge of her I certainly feel that loss myself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02386"><member>The Lord Archbishop of Canterbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add my voice in support of the whole of
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0275"/>
<col>533</col>
what has been said by the Leader of the House in repeating the Statement made by the Prime Minister. I should like to record from these Benches my horror and dismay at the assassination of a much respected Commonwealth Prime Minister.<lb/>
While herself leading one of the world's largest nations, Mrs. Gandhi also campaigned ceaselessly for the security and development of many smaller and less powerful nations. As chairman of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in New Delhi last winter, she gave the lead in drafting the Goa declaration, which calls for action to reduce tension in the world. Mrs. Gandhi's stature in the Commonwealth was matched only by the regard felt for her by the people of her country. Her place will not easily be filled.<lb/>
I know that Christians everywhere will join with me not just in expressing respect for a great and humane stateswoman and not just in expressing outrage at the apparent triumph of violence for the moment, but also in offering sympathy and prayers for the family, for all the people of India at this time, and for all the Indian communities in this country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02387"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the most reverend Primate for what he has said and I am sure it will be felt in all parts of the House that he has given expression from those Benches in a way that is most fitting for this particular occasion. Perhaps I may say to him personally that it is much to his credit that he has managed, among many engagements, to fit in time to come and pay that tribute in the House today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02388"><member>Lord Sherfield</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, on behalf of all noble Lords on these Benches I should like to add my thanks to the noble Viscount the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement and to associate ourselves with the sentiments of shock and disgust at this dastardly act which has deprived India of its leader at a critical time. We, too, express our deep sympathy with Mrs. Gandhi's family and with the Indian Government and people at this fateful moment in their history.<lb/>
Like many other noble Lords, I have indelible memories of meeting this courageous and indomitable woman. I met her for the first time 25 years ago in New Delhi when she was supporting, and acting as hostess for, her father. So I, too, like so many noble Lords, have a sense of personal loss. We can only hope that the shock of this disaster will help to bring the peoples of India closer together and that the ranks will close to preserve and strengthen the democratic institutions of that great nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02389"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for adding his voice on behalf of the Cross-Benches, thereby indicating the complete unity of this House in what has been said today.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02390"><member>Lord Brockway</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having worked over many years with the Indian Prime Minister I find it difficult to speak, but I feel I must. I had known Indira Gandhi since she was a university student in this country. I had close association with her father, the first Prime Minister of India. I was critical of her,
<col>534</col>
during her first period of office, for her repression of the opposition, but since then I have had unbounded admiration for the service which she has rendered to world harmony and peace.<lb/>
I regard the series of speeches which she delivered on international affairs as the noblest made by any statesman in the world. It was a marvellous achievement that at the meeting of the non-aligned conference, representing more than half the population of the world, her leadership got them to adopt disarmament and development as their first two objectives.<lb/>
Last August Mrs. Gandhi invited me to India to attend the anniversary celebrations of Indian independence and we had one hour's talk about the problems of peace in the world. She was thought to be hard and she could be tough, but during that hour there was in her personality a concern for human beings, and a compassion. I admit that my admiration for her grew into affection. It is not only India which has lost a great leader; the world has lost a great leader who was striving for a world order in which there will be harmony and peace.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02391"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is almost impertinent for someone such as myself to refer to anything that the noble Lord, Lord Brockway, says on this subject. We all in this House recognise him as one who over many years has been a great friend of India, a great friend of her people and a great friend of her various leaders, including Mrs. Gandhi. That adds great weight to his words today and I am sure that we are all extremely grateful to have heard from him on this occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02392"><member>Lord Home of the Hirsel</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, having worked over many years in Commonwealth circles with Mr. Nehru and then with Mrs. Gandhi, I should like to add my own words of revulsion at this horrible crime which, as the Prime Minister said, has deprived India of its great leader and the Commonwealth of an outstanding personality.<lb/>
I should like to join also in the messages of sympathy and understanding that go from this House to the Indian people and the Indian Government; in particular, to Mrs. Gandhi's son who assumes enormous responsibilities at this tragic time. We must pray for peace in that great country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02393"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend. I know that his words, coming from one who has done so much for the affairs of this country, for the world, and so much for the Commonwealth, will be heard with very great pleasure and understanding in India. I am extremely grateful to him for having come here this afternoon to add them to what has been said.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02394"><member>Baroness White</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to add a brief word. Mrs. Gandhi was an undergraduate and, subsequently, with our own Prime Minister, an honorary fellow of Somvervile College, Oxford. I think one of her moments of great pride was when the University of Oxford conferred upon her an honorary doctorate of civil law. I remember distinctly the ceremony in the Sheldonian and the feminine touch
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0276"/>
<col>535</col>
which was there, in spite of the statesmanlike poise with which she greeted the occasion. She had inquired most carefully as to the precise shade of scarlet of the doctors' gowns so that her beautiful sari should match exactly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02395"><member>Viscount Whitelaw</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, who speaks of another aspect of Mrs. Gandhi's life which again adds to our occasion.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Human Fertilisation: Warnock Report</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02396">3.50 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02397">Debate resumed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02398"><member>The Marquess of Reading</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the shadow of this appalling event, I beg the indulgence of the House to make my maiden speech. My apprehension at addressing your Lordships is outweighed by the importance that I attach to this debate. I shall try to be brief and to the point. Briefly, I want to concentrate on the moral status of the embryo. The manipulation of human embryos, especially for experimental purposes, depends for its moral validity on the nature of the human embryo itself. Clearly, if the embryo is not a human person with the right to life, such manipulations are ethically justified.<lb/>
The Warnock Committee allows the use of embryos for experimentation at least up until the fourteenth day after fertilisation. Although the report denies the embryo the status of a human person or human being, nowhere does it define what a human person or a human being is. Nearly everyone accepts the biological fact that the embryo is a human being. After the fertilisation process has been successfully completed, we have a genetically distinct individual which may continue its path of development to maturity. In the whole human life cycle there is no moment of comparable significance to that of fertilisation. However, some have argued that not every human being is a human person and that the embryo, by reason of its immaturity, is not a human person with a right to life.<lb/>
Broadly speaking, beliefs are divided between two models of human personhood. Personhood is either something that we achieve some time after fertilisation or it is something with which we are endowed from fertilisation. Those who say that personhood is achieved&#x2014;for example, at the fourteenth day, or some time later&#x2014;define personhood in functional terms. An individual is a person when it has achieved a certain IQ, has the ability to feel pain, to feel concern for others, to communicate, to be able to relate to others, and so on. For example, Joseph Fletcher, the eminent American ethicist, has suggested 15 positive criteria for human personhood. Absence of any one of the 15 criteria would mean that the individual was not a person.<lb/>
The difficulty with this sort of assessment of when an individual is a person is considerable. Who is to decide what the criteria are and how they are to be applied? The definition of personhood is essentially functional. What happens to those individuals who through accident, illness or old age lose one or more of the
<col>536</col>
functions held to be necessary for personhood? May we kill them, too? If personhood is something which is achieved, it is also something which can be lost. Are we really satisfied that human worth is no more than functional?<lb/>
If we reject the achievement model of personhood, we are left with the idea that an individual is a person by endowment; that is, every single human being has intrinsic worth and therefore has basic human rights. Since the right to life precedes all other rights, it follows that embryonic human beings should have protection in law.<lb/>
Some have argued that the existence of liberal abortion laws has already decided the issue against the moral status of the human embryo. We already abort foetuses of much greater maturity than the human embryo, so why not be consistent and allow that the embryo is not a person? The fact is that the United Kingdom does not have abortion on demand in its law, whatever the practice; and in any case the issue of abortion arises only when a woman is pregnant and there is a perceived conflict of rights between the woman and the foetus. That conflict may be resolved by giving greater or lesser weight to the rights and interests of the competing individuals.<lb/>
However, to make a human embryo in the laboratory is to make a completely isolated human being. The embryonic human being represents no risk to anyone. The only justification being used to experiment with it and kill it is to serve the interests of medical science. We should not allow any born individual who could not give informed consent to be subjected to experimentation; and we would not in any case allow experiments on individuals if they would certainly die as a result of the experiment. The existence of liberal abortion laws in no way affects the calculated manufacture of human persons to be used as objects of experiments.<lb/>
The whole of British law has been traditionally influenced by the Christian religion. That faith upholds the sanctity of every single human life. The principle of the sanctity of life may be perceived by reason alone. It is the corner-stone of the natural law, without which all morality would be a matter of opinion. The principle is also upheld in the Christian faith. For example, the psalmist says:
<quote>"For you have created my inward parts:</quote>
<quote>You knit me together in my mother's womb.</quote>
<quote>You knew my soul and my bones were not hidden from you:</quote>
<quote>When I was formed in secret and woven in the depths of the earth".</quote>
Clearly the Old Testament writer ascribes personhood to the developing embryo without the benefit of the contemporary scientific knowledge of the individuality of the foetus. The embryo is referred to in personal terms rather than as a bundle of protoplasm and blood.<lb/>
This is taken a step further in the New Testament. Not only does John the Baptist leap in the womb of Elizabeth when Elizabeth is visited by the pregnant Mary, but that which is conceived in the womb of Mary is identified as the Lord right from the beginning.<lb/>
Therefore, in conclusion, human life, created in the image and likeness of God, has intrinsic value irrespective of its maturity or the development of
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0277"/>
<col>537</col>
functional skills. Thus embryonic human beings are the same person that they will be when they are older and more developed. Put another way, if we examine an adult person under a microscope we do not see all that is to be known of that person. We are animated individuals from the time of fertilisation. Our essential identity is always becoming known, but it is there right from the beginning.<lb/>
It seems paradoxical for the report to claim that the embryo deserves some protection on the one hand, and to recommend, on the other, that a human embryo may be sold&#x2014;and I quote from paragraph 13.13:
<quote>"a complete prohibition on the purchase or sale of such material would be inappropriate. A balance has to be struck and therefore we recommend that the sale or purchase of human gametes or embryos should be permitted only under licence from, and subject to, conditions prescribed by the licensing body and therefore unauthorised sale or purchase should be made a criminal offence".</quote>
But, nevertheless, it says that they should be permitted to be sold.<lb/>
Secondly, the report says that a human embryo may be frozen:
<quote>"We recommend a maximum of ten years for storage of embryos after which time the right to use or disposal should pass to the storage authority".</quote>
Nevertheless, it says that a human embryo may be frozen.<lb/>
Finally it says that a human embryo may be experimented upon up to 14 days after fertilisation. It says:
<quote>"legislation should provide that research may be carried out on an embryo resulting from <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, whatever its provenance, up to the end of the fourteenth day after fertilisation, but subject to all other restrictions as may be imposed by the licensing body".</quote>
So, finally, to create, in the laboratory, isolated human beings for the purpose of experimentation, or to use so-called "spare" embryos for that purpose, represents a blatant disregard for the civil rights of those human beings, as well as endorsing the principle that we can be justified in defining some human persons as non-persons in order to use them for our own interests.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02399">4 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02400"><member>The Lord Bishop of Chelmsford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it falls to me to have the privilege of congratulating the noble Marquess, Lord Reading, on the incisive and important speech which he has just made. I am sure we look forward to hearing him very often in this House. As we have heard, very many welcome this report, which represents the desire of public policy makers to consider the implications of the developments of new technologies for ethics, for law, and for social position. Some of these matters are well established. The development of research which has led to the successful use of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation has raised many questions, some of which are legal questions and have already been referred to in this debate.<lb/>
The subject falls into two natural sections. First of all one looks at the therapy which is concerned with this. We are dealing here with the use of these technologies in order to help those who are involuntarily childless to have a family. The Church has to make it clear that its commitment to marriage and the integrity of the family means that it does not
<col>538</col>
see these services being appropriate for anyone other than couples who are involuntarily childless or couples for whom there are specific medical reasons why it would be unwise for them to have children by the normal means, as, for example, in cases of a serious risk of genetic defect in the children so produced.<lb/>
I should think we hardly need reminding&#x2014;but nevertheless I remind the House&#x2014;of the intense stress and pain caused to couples when they discover that for some reason or another they cannot have children of their own. Of course, in times past a resolution of this problem could be found through adoption. But that is less possible today. There is a great reduction in the number of babies available for adoption.<lb/>
One of the reasons why we need to stress the importance of the provision of professional counselling, about which we have already heard, as part of a publicly provided service, is that couples often need help in working on their reactions if they are by these means to enter into the family experience in an open and truthful way. Such is the nature of some of these technologies that secrecy and deceit can be encouraged and children can be left in ignorance of where they have come from. This problem has already arisen in many cases with adopted children. Secrets in the family are often dangerous and flow from difficulties in accepting the fact of infertility. Nevertheless, I think that we all must naturally feel increasing hesitancy, the further removed are the practices from the natural means of procreation.<lb/>
AIH&#x2014;that is artificial insemination with semen supplied by the husband&#x2014;is now very widely used. It has operated successfully for many years. It would seem that most people see little difficulty in accepting this method. After all, it is an aid to fertilisation and not an interference with the natural order involving a third person.<lb/>
AID brings much stronger disagreements. Those who believe that any use of donated material is in principle a breach of the bond between union and procreation in marriage will reject AID. Many others do not agree with this approach. They accept it because it does provide for couples that they may have their own children. They believe that couples need the help of professional counselling. They believe that, where necessary, children should have access to information about their origins, but should not have access to the names of the donors. There are already procedures for this in cases of adoption. Certainly donors should not be paid but only reimbursed for expenses. Certainly semen should not be bought or sold and not more than 10 children should be fathered by one donor.<lb/>
Egg donation <i>in vitro</i> takes the matter a step further, although we recognise that this involves mothers in bearing children with whom they have no genetic link at all. Many people will find it morally distasteful. Much research needs to be done into the needs of the families involved in this way. Embryo donation in circumstances where the woman cannot produce an egg and the man is infertile means that the embryo donated to the mother has no genetic link with either one of the couple. Many people will feel that this has crossed the moral boundary, that it is unacceptable and that they are not able to agree with it. This is a matter of judgment but they feel that there are real
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0278"/>
<col>539</col>
moral difficulties in producing children who have no kind of genetic relationship to the couple who are to parent them. I must say that I share this view.<lb/>
Dame Mary Warnock herself says in her report that surrogacy should be outlawed. It has not yet been widely established in the United Kingdom, but surely this is something upon which the Government could and should act quickly in order to prevent it becoming established. Womb leasing, as it has been called, is surrogacy for a fee. The introduction of a payment and a contract which is unenforceable in law&#x2014;since all contracts concerning the unborn are unenforceable&#x2014;is wholly unacceptable and it undermines the dignity of women, of childbearing and of the family.<lb/>
There is, then, a range of moral responses in these various approaches, which the Church of England, for instance, has to face. There will be wide, though not total, agreement in the rightness of AIH for infertile couples and the wrongness of surrogacy. Between these positions there are the differing judgments on the other ways. However, it appears that Anglican sources and other sources are, with increasing knowledge and reflection, developing their view of these things. It is notable that a number of leading moral theologians of all denominations have found themselves able to accept some of these practices as responsible ways in which childless couples may be helped to have a family of their own&#x2014;which must remain the main criterion. The report says that public policy needs to agree the minimum requirement for a tolerable society. We believe it to be right, recognising that there will be those who would wish to draw a stricter line. It is for Her Majesty's Government to see that responsible and public provision is made for these matters.<lb/>
So we turn to research. We have noted, and this has already often been mentioned, that research cannot be permitted on live human embryos after 14 days. This is a majority recommendation. However, there are two dissenting notes. One is against research on live embryos. The other is against the production of embryos for research, the willingness to permit research on embryos produced for IVF and which are spare. Apparently one needs spare embryos for implantation in IVF.<lb/>
The argument for the 14-day limit is that individuation is not complete until 14 days. I am told that up to that point for example the embryo may split and form twins. The point has been made and must be made often that the moral response depends on the answer given to the big question of when human life is to be given the protection which we afford to all human beings. Some would say from implantation, and that the embryo has the right of protection from that point because it should have the benefit of doubt about its status. This is, I think, what the Roman Catholics believe, and it is supported by many Anglican thinkers. Others, accepting that human life is worthy of respect, are not willing to afford it full protection until, in a meaningful way, it has achieved status as an individual. Individuation, as I have said, marks a useful point in delineating this.<lb/>
Up to this point, accepting that respect for human life should be evidenced in not allowing research except for purposes to do with the alleviation of the
<col>540</col>
problems of infertility and genetic disorder, research for these purposes surely may be accepted. Here again Anglicans are not altogether agreed. Responsible theological opinion is divided. Some Anglicans will therefore object to all research that threatens the life of the embryo. Others will accept research for agreed purposes. We know, in spite of good intentions, how difficult it is for public bodies to control such activities. We are not confident that the licensing body will be able to do this and certainly feel that its power and authority need first establishing in the public mind.<lb/>
It is possible easily to imagine powerful interest groups wanting to use human embryos for research on a wide scale and perhaps for trivial purposes. This is a real fear. Drug companies, for example, certainly are not trivial. But they are powerful bodies and might prove difficult to control. Further, there is a moral difference between the use of spare embryos produced to help in solving problems of childlessness through infertility; and, on the other hand, specifically creating embryos for the sole purpose of research.<lb/>
Christians, among others, view with considerable caution and unease the idea of using human embryos for research purposes. We value and respect all life and especially human life made in the image of God. There are some of us however who believe that, in its earliest stages, before individuation is complete, human life may not have the same protection as we afford individuals. Therefore, some are able to support research using human embryos up to the 14-day limit suggested. Others believe that we may not do that. Our belief forbids any assault of any kind on the life of an embryo. All of us however are opposed to research for other than strictest purposes to deal with problems of infertility and within strict and enforceable boundaries of control. I have considerable sympathy with the dissenting note in the report, signed by Canon Dyson and others, which is opposed to the production of embryos for research purposes altogether. In the light of the considerable unease of the committee on research, evidenced by the two dissenting voices, signed between them by seven of the 16 members of the committee, it makes one wonder whether there is enough of a consensus here to proceed along the lines of the majority recommendation.<lb/>
Turning briefly to social provision, it is essential&#x2014;the point has been made a number of times&#x2014;that a strong, independent body monitoring this area and setting professional and ethical standards of practice, must be set up. I believe that it should report annually and publicly and be seen to be independent in its procedures. We have been warned against hasty legislation; but I would have thought that there is need for action by Her Majesty's Government in the following areas: in outlawing surrogacy and banning forthwith the sale of semen; in making babies born as a result of donation legitimate; in establishing the licensing body to begin to exercise control through the setting and enforcing of standards for agencies both in therapy and research; in providing adequate resources to enable professional counselling as a constituent part of the service, and for research into the needs of families brought into being by the use of these technologies and especially the special needs of children born through AID or IVF technology.<lb/>

A last word: it is apparent that the conclusions of the Government will need to be strictly hedged around in order that proper respect is paid to human life at every level. But supremely, I remind your Lordships again, our concern is for childless families, that they may be enabled to experience a full and rich family life. This must be the will of all of us in this Chamber, as I am certain that it is the will of God.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02402"><member>Lord Denning</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, perhaps I may first join in congratulating my noble friend Lord Reading on his speech. It reminded me, in its clarity and force, of those which I have heard from his distinguished ancestry in this House. I hope that we may often hear him.<lb/>
The Government did well to ask Dame Mary Warnock and her companions to study this most important question&#x2014;socially, one of the most important questions of our time&#x2014;on which there is at the moment no law and no restriction whatever. Medical scientists and medical men can do as they like with what I believe are human beings. There is no regulation at all. Buy or sell, kill, freeze and the like; medical men do as they like without any control. These are dangers to our society.<lb/>
I should like to deal with the issue in two parts, first as a lawyer. There is no law on these matters at the moment. It is too modern. No lawyers have had to deal with it. Ask the simple question, "To whom does an embryo belong?" Let me remind your Lordships what the embryo is. The medical men take the semen from the male, they take the eggs from the female, and they mingle them together <i>in vitro</i>, as it is called, which, put into English, means they are put into a glass or a test tube. Then, unless they have an immediate use for them, unless there is a woman immediately at hand for the embryo to be put into her womb, they freeze them. They can freeze them for years and then thaw them out and put them into a woman, maybe years hence, when the man who has given the sperm is long since dead. Is that compatible with human dignity?<lb/>
The law will have to deal with it. Parliament will have to deal with it. But how long will it take? It will take a long debate. It will require very serious consideration by the medical profession; indeed, by all the professions. Meanwhile, the judges may have to deal with it and pronounce upon the law as they find it to be.<lb/>
So, as a lawyer, I would ask this question: Who owns that human embryo when it is fertilised in the test tube? This is what the committee says:
<quote>"Until now the law has never had to consider the existence of embryos outside the mother's uterus. The existence of such embryos raises potentially difficult problems as to ownership".</quote>
This is important.
<quote>"The concept of ownership of human embryos seems to us to be undesirable. We recommend that legislation be enacted to ensure there is no right of ownership in a human embryo".</quote>
If the judges have to decide this now, this would be the alternative before them. Are we to regard that embryo as a thing? Is the male semen and the female egg each a thing in the ownership of one or the other? Then, when they are mixed together, are they things? If they are things, I would answer your Lordships by saying
<col>542</col>
that they are in the joint ownership of the man and the woman; it is joint ownership. If they are in the joint ownership of the man and the woman, no one can destroy them, no one can do anything with them without the consent of the other. No person can experiment with them or freeze them. They are in the joint ownership of both. They may consent; I do not know. But that would be the position if they are regarded as things.<lb/>
I would agree with the committee that they are not to be regarded as things. I have read the scientific evidence, and from the moment of fertilisation, when the male and female cells come together and are conceived, there is a different, new being&#x2014;a living being. Is it a thing? God forbid! It is not a thing; it is a combination of male and female life to produce a new life. When we see that, it is the beginning of a child. The law has already pronounced that after about three or four months the infant in the womb at that stage, when it quickens&#x2014;this goes back as far as Blackstone&#x2014;is a being which will be protected by the law and can recover its own damages and the like; that is when it is three or four months old.<lb/>
The law will have to pronounce on what is the position before that time. It has never had to pronounce on it before. I would suggest that the only logical point at which the law could start is that the child, the human being, starts at the moment of conception and fertilisation. From that point onwards there is a gradual development in its environment. So I would hold&#x2014;and I would hope the judges would hold&#x2014;that from that moment there is a living, human being which is entitled to protection just as much as the law protects a child. The committee recommends that the law should give protection to the embryo. If there is no legislation, I would suggest that it does so already, by holding that that is a human being from the moment of fertilisation, and the law should protect it just as it already protects a child. If it does protect it in this way, it cannot be sold or bought, it cannot be destroyed, it cannot be experimented upon for research or the like.<lb/>
If I may do so, I should like to say that that should be the law, as I would believe it to be if there is no legislation. I should like to see legislation to deal with this point. There is a horrible thought in my mind. Just think of the position if this being is thawed out 10 or 12 years later and the child is then born to a parent or parents who are dead. To my mind it is inconceivable, horrible. So much for this problem of when human life begins. To my mind it begins at the moment of fertilisation. So much for the law.<lb/>
This committee's report needs careful examination to see what the implications are. Let there be a statutory authority; that is very good. There must be, because there is no law upon it at the moment. There must be a statutory authority to regulate these matters. But how dangerous it is! There is a cardinal principle running through this report. I am not dealing with the case when it is husband and wife themselves whose cells are mingled and they produce a child by mechanical means. No one would quarrel with that. It is done by artificial insemination, by putting the husband's semen into the wife's uterus. I would suggest there is no objection whatever to mechanical means as between husband and wife to see that they have their own child. No one should object to that.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0280"/>
<col>543</col>
The problem comes when a third person is introduced. The cardinal principle running through this report is that there should be anonymity. The report says the committee were agreed that there was a need to maintain the absolute anonymity of the donor. Let me describe to your Lordships the procedure which is contemplated and which will be legalised if these recommendations go through. Let us, my Lords, envisage a situation where a man is invited to give his semen to procreate a child. The clinic finds it difficult to find men who are ready to donate semen in this way. That is not surprising. The clinic often has to pay a fee for it. Perhaps it is medical students or strangers off the street. Pay a fee, if you please!<lb/>
The man goes to the clinic; perhaps he is paid his fee, or at least his expenses; they agree there. Then he gives his semen by masturbation. They collect it in a tube. They take his name and description. They examine him medically to see whether or not he has any inherited disease. When he has passed all those tests they collect the semen and put it in the test tube. If they do not need it at once, they will freeze it and put it into the semen bank, ready for use whenever any suitable occasion should arise, perhaps five, 10 or 12 years later. The man may go out of that clinic and be killed in a road accident, or die the next day, long before the semen is used. To me, it is horrible to think that his semen could be used to procreate a child after he is dead. It is bringing a man to life again in order that he may procreate a child. That is what happens when the man goes. "Be careful", they say. "Don't let any particulars of him be known; give him a number". There is no photograph of him, or anything like that. The description is kept in safe custody. There is just a number for him with the semen bank.<lb/>
Then take the woman. She, no doubt, badly wants a child, but cannot have one by her husband. She goes to the clinic and says. "Please, will you help cure my infertility?" She would like to know the nature of the man; she would like to see his photograph; she would like to see whether he is tall or short, ugly or plain, or whatever it may be. But, oh, no! Nothing of that must be told. She must not be allowed to know the identity of the man in the least. Apparently she can be told, according to this report, whether he is black or white, but that is about all. She must not be allowed to discover his identity in the least; that is what the report recommends.<lb/>
This principle of anonymity is so that neither the man nor the woman can know who the other is or be able to identify them in the least. What they recommend is that when a child is born of this mingling&#x2014;to the woman and the second man, the stranger; not her husband&#x2014;in those circumstances that child should, by law, be made to be the legitimate child of the husband and the woman and that this unknown father should disappear into the blue, rid of all his responsibilities to his child.<lb/>
The law has never before allowed a man to escape from his responsibilities to a child of which he is the father. But this law would enable him to do so. He will allow his semen to be taken on the basis of "Oh no, I don't want the responsibilities of being a father. No thank you. I'll take the money as a fee, but I don't want to take on those responsibilities".<lb/>
<col>544</col>
Those are the terms upon which he will allow his semen to be taken. The unfortunate woman has to put up with the medical man selecting the most suitable semen or man for her to have a child by. In my view this anonymity is becoming very repulsive, especially when the semen can be thawed out years later and brought back to life and children can be born to people who are dead.<lb/>
The report seems to be rather sympathetic to widows. A woman's husband may die, but if his semen had been collected it could be used to beget a child after he has died. In my view that is horrible. It is horrible that a man should be able to procreate a child after his death and bring himself to life again for that purpose.<lb/>
I am stressing these matters to show what the licensing entails. But just think what it will mean if it is allowed to go. We shall have a man whose semen may be used to procreate a child long after he himself is dead. He may procreate dozens and dozens of children by different women. It is recommended that there be a limit of 10. The man may go to many clinics and I suppose that his semen may be collected if they pay a fee. There could be dozens of children walking about the streets with the same fair features as the father but no one will know who is the father. Those are some of the social consequences which will result from the anonymity principle. In my view it is a horrible thought that an unknown man should be the father of a child and no one would be able to trace him or know anything about him whatsoever.<lb/>
The licensing system as envisaged by the Warnock Committee is potentially most dangerous to our society. I do not mind maintaining, as far as one can, the true relationship of husband and wife in the institution of marriage. But the concept of artificial insemination by the donor or the like is something which I believe the Archbishop was against in 1948, but I do not know what right reverend Prelates will think about it. However, I hope that, as a result of all our discussions this danger which would affect our society will not be loosed upon us.<lb/>
However, those are just the social considerations. The great value of the committee's report is that it gives us the material for debate. I am sure that in both this House and the other place the matter will be most seriously debated.<lb/>
In my view medical science is outstripping itself, because it has not sufficient regard for the great ethical, moral and religious structures which underlie our society. It must be regulated by a proper licensing authority and regulated in the proper way. I hope that in due course this House, along with the other place, will be able to pass the appropriate legislation.</membercontribution></p>

<col>545</col>
I should like this evening to inquire into, and perhaps throw a little light on, the reasoning lying behind the conclusion in paragraph 17 of Chapter 11 of the report that:
<quote>"the embryo of the human species ought to have a special status",</quote>
with a view to expressing my own disquiet at the recommendation that experimentation should be allowed in the 14 days after conception of the embryo <i>in vitro</i>.<lb/>
It seems to me to be very pertinent to inquire why the majority of the committee&#x2014;the nine who did not sign either Expressions of Dissent B or C&#x2014;felt that the human embryo should have this special status. I find it very difficult to see from the report why the majority were prepared to allow the human embryo this privilege. That being so, I can see little to persuade me that the majority sincerely intend more than lip service to this special status. My reading of the report leads me to the firm conclusion that the majority see this lip service as the best means of turning aside the undoubted horror with which most people view genetic engineering and all the other possibilities opened up and now opening up for so long as experimentation on the human embryo conceived <i>in vitro</i> is permitted.<lb/>
As to the exact nature of the special status to be afforded to the human embryo, the report, having in paragraph 17 of Chapter 11 recommended,
<quote>"that the embryo of the human species should be afforded some protection in law",</quote>
immediately in paragraph 18 of Chapter 11 goes on to offer the following proposition:
<quote>"That protection should exist does not entail that this protection may not be waived in certain specific circumstances".</quote>
What type of legal protection, 1 ask, is this? What type of special status have they in mind?<lb/>
The best answer that I can give, after a careful reading of the report, is to invite your Lordships to consider for a moment what the research scientist, desiring to achieve advance in treatment and medical knowledge, will be prohibited by statute from doing to the human embryo conceived <i>in vitro if</i> the majority of the committee have their way. He will not be able to carry out research on the embryo after 14 days after conception (plus any period of up to 10 years in cold storage within those 14 days). That is the only absolute right of the embryo to be embodied in statute and not to depend on the judgment of the research scientist or the licensing authority. The period of 14 days seems to me to be of interest, and I think that a few moments may be well spent in conjecturing why the majority chose this period or, indeed, any period. I say "conjecturing" advisedly because I can find no clear, certain argument in the report.<lb/>
There would appear from the report to have been a wide measure of agreement among the bodies giving evidence in support of experimentation that at some stage in the development of the embryo experimentation should cease. The views range from, at the short end, a number of unnamed groups submitting that no embryo should be used for research after the beginning of its implantation stage (which I take to mean about five days after conception) to, at the long end, an unidentified utilitarian expression of opinion that research should be permitted until the embryo is
<col>546</col>
capable of feeling pain; that is to say, until 22 or 23 days after conception by one view, or longer by another.<lb/>
In between these views are the named organisations&#x2014;the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Medical Research Council and the Royal College of Physicians. They all propose closing dates for experimentation more or less consistent with the recommendation of the Warnock Committee's majority.<lb/>
What is curious is that, with the possible exception of the unnamed proponent of the utilitarian argument in the report, not one argument is attributed to any of the organisations, neither as to why they think that there should be a time limit, nor as to why the time limit should be the limit proposed. Nor is there any trace of argument that a significantly longer period for experimentation should be allowed following the example of the Abortion Act. It seems to me to be clear beyond reasonable doubt that one consideration, and one consideration only, guided the majority of the committee. The evidence is to be found at the end of paragraph 11.19 of Chapter 11. There it states:
<quote>"However we agreed that this was an area in which some precise decision must be taken, in order to allay public anxiety."</quote>
My Lords, "to allay public anxiety"&#x2014;that says it all.<lb/>
Is it not apparent that the majority favour a much longer period for experimentation, and view 14 days as the most that public opinion can be persuaded to accept at this moment, and at the same time regard it as the necessary foot in the door, opening it in fact if not in law to unlimited research? That is what it would prove to be&#x2014;an open invitation to pass through an open door. It might be difficult to police a total ban on the creation and keeping alive of human embryos for purposes other than implantation. It would be well nigh impossible to monitor the work of research scientists to ensure that they do not exceed a 14-days' maximum.<lb/>
In my view the humanist, whether or not religious, should view human life as unique in this world, and unless and until the contrary is proved as unique in the universe. I hope that my noble friend will consider the view that there should be a moratorium on all experimentation with a human embryo in line with dissenting voice B until legislation can be introduced.</membercontribution></p>

If he will allow me to say so, it was well presented and well documented, and I hope as the House does that we shall hear him speak with equal force and cogency many times in the future.<lb/>
I find myself faced with problems which can perhaps best be expressed in the setting of a world so fundamentally different from that in which many of the moral principles to which I want to adhere first began to take their place. The nuclear age has vastly increased our power to destroy to an apocryphal degree. The scientific age in which we live has marvellously increased our power to do all sorts of things that our fathers were totally unable even to contemplate. If I may refer to it, I thought that the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0282"/>
<col>547</col>
strength and purchase of the television programme "Sea of Faith", under the direction of Don Cupitt, was to stress the way in which responsibility has so far changed as to rest so much more upon human beings, and that obedience to God, which once was the simple way of acknowledging one's own impotence, has now given place to a world in which so many of the things previously ascribed to God's omnipotent power are now within our competence if we so desire to make use of them. It is in that that the problem of morality, so clearly enunciated in the introduction to this particular document, seems to me to be of particular value. I naturally try to face this from the standpoint of the faith which I hold, but I find myself in considerable difficulty in relating what is supposed to be Christian morality to this new situation. Let me illustrate this aspect. Let us suppose I start by saying, "The <i>Bible</i> says, and I must obey what it says". For instance, I find in the Old Testament a savage doctrine about homosexuality, which is totally unfair, unreal and, in my judgment, un-Christian. I turn to the New Testament and I find in the Gospels practically nothing on this variegated theme, for various obvious reasons. Therefore, I have to find my morality, at least in specific terms, in the processes of the Christian Church.<lb/>
The Christian Church very largely has laid down its principles with regard to sexual morality in terms of a conception which is now completely out of date and quite wrong. It was traditionally assumed that man was the giver of the seed of life, which was implanted, embedded, in the cradle which woman provided, and therefore no-one need look very much further for the discrepancy between the value attached to the cradle and the value attached to the baby in that cradle. In my judgment this goes a long way to explain the kind of morality which was geared to the superiority of man and the docile acceptance of a cradle authority on the part of woman. We know that that is untrue. Therefore, if we are to process the deliberations of countless arguments that are to be found in this particular document, we have to work out, first, somewhat arbitrarily, what we believe to be the essence of the moral case.<lb/>
I would submit that there are two basic principles. One is compassion and the other is the framework of the family as the desirable paramenter in which life should be nurtured, and indeed in which life should be protected. There is a third principle&#x2014;and I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley, for making it&#x2014;that there is no morality which can be acclaimed as 100 per cent. There is an inevitable area of compromise in whatever we do on this planet, and that area of compromise has already been widely accepted by those who, although they subscribe to the sanctity of life, nevertheless believe that it is tolerable&#x2014;and morally tolerable in cases of war&#x2014;to take life almost indiscriminately.<lb/>
It seems to me that there is no way in which one can do good in one area without, to some extent, invading the liberty or indeed the happiness of other groups. I therefore have to make a distinction between the happiness that can be offered to family and the harm that can be done to a potential life. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that we do not use words like
<col>548</col>
"baby", "child" and "living creature" with great clarity; after all, a flower is alive and so is a beetle. But that is by way of argument which I do not want to deploy in any sense of being argumentative for the sake of scoring a point.<lb/>
More importantly, as a minister of Christianity (very imperfectly for many years), I have had to weigh many times the good that can be done to a family against the harm that might be done particularly to forms of life which, whatever their potential sanctity at a certain stage, in my judgment are not to be compared with the value of those who are fully adult and looking forward to the blessings that can be offered through many of these modern methods of assisting nature and indeed of making possible that which natural processes do not make possible.<lb/>
Therefore, with those principles in mind, I venture to apply myself to the various questions that are asked and answered in this document. I find no ethical difficulty in AIH. If we are to assist in medical ways to help people to bear children, then AIH&#x2014;that is, artificial insemination by the husband&#x2014;seems to me to be perfectly acceptable and right. I have no difficulty there at all.<lb/>
On the question of the donor in artificial insemination and particularly the <i>in vitro</i> method, there are innumerable difficulties, and many of them have been ventilated with considerable care this afternoon. I accept them. I regard some of them as prohibitive. I think others are tolerable. In general terms, on the question of AID I would apply the principles of compassion; the provision of happiness to people who otherwise would not enjoy it; and, above all, the retention of the principle of the family&#x2014;that is to say, the existence of the relationship between mother and father and child which in some cases is not prevented when it is artificially stimulated.<lb/>
It is when I come to the question of surrogacy that I find myself in the greatest of difficulties. If there is the slightest taint of commercialism about it, I want nothing to do with it; I cannot. But, on the other hand, it seems to me that there is a question here which ultimately is an extension and not a contradiction of what goes before. I agree with the document that the same principles that apply to AID and to <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation apply to the question of surrogacy. What I do not believe and cannot tolerate for one moment is the idea that there should be a bank of anonymous semen which would be available at any time to satisfy the whims or desires of those who do not wish to go through the agonies or the raptures of pregnancy, but for various reasons are anxious to have a child.<lb/>
I am not particularly impressed by the argument that one must not indulge in any research on one of the spare embryos which necessarily will be produced in this way. It is clear to me that there is no greater moral value in saying that we must just allow the spare embryos to die, or to say that we can indeed make use of them for future culture or for future ways of delivering them ourselves from these particularly difficult and complex problems.<lb/>
I welcome this document. It will not go away. I welcome the fact that there is a sense in which modern knowledge is irreversible. We have to deal with a situation in which we are increasingly able to do
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0283"/>
<col>549</col>
things, and if we can, with compassion and, I believe, within the general parameter of the family, seek to do them, then on balance I believe they can be reconciled with the Christian faith.<lb/>
One last word. I am attracted by the English translation of <i>in vitro</i>, which of course is "in a glass", and I reflect upon the 13th chapter of Corinthians, in which Paul, talking about compassion, says:
<quote>"now we see through glass, darkly".</quote>
Indeed we do.<lb/>
May I say a little about the possible future? When we reach the stage of sex selection we shall be in a very different kind of world as when we reach the stage, which surely is coming&#x2014;and whatever is suggested or prohibited, it will be done&#x2014;when we are able to select particular qualities which could be handed down. I am reflecting in this regard on, after all, what is one of the considerations in the contemporary situation which considers that future. Let me put it in the form of an analogy. It is impossible to play snooker if, to use the Gilbertian phrase, one has
<quote>"a cloth untrue</quote>
<quote>With a twisted cue,</quote>
<quote>And elliptical billiard balls".</quote>
The game of snooker is totally prohibited if one has not the right instruments with which to play. But the game of life is not totally prevented, and its happiness and joy are not totally prevented, if we assume that the contemporary aspects of pleasure and contemporary ways of fulfilment are the only ways in which life may be fulfilled. That is not true.<lb/>
When I think of many a woman who has dedicated her life to the care of her parents and of many a would-be family which has been built not on the natural process of mother and father but on the fatherhood and motherhood of large institutions and those who care for the worldwide family, then I am persuaded that, though it is in a far distant future, the very parameters of motherhood and fatherhood within the family are not necessarily the end to which humanity may come.<lb/>
This is a wild dream in one sense, but it is not so remote when we consider now the capacities we have to rise above the material world in which we live and, by the instruments which the scientists can give us, to aspire to a more spiritual life in which one day, perhaps, the very concept of what we are considering in this document becomes something which has passed away in a different kind of spirituality. It is a long way off, but it is something which I believe has to be taken into account if we are to face this new world, as I believe we must, in the spirit of Jesus Christ and, above all, in his words, that more things he has to tell us but we are not ready to hear them yet.<lb/>
I commend this report. I believe we shall make many mistakes if we follow many of the suggestions that it propounds; but I believe it ushers in for us the kind of responsibilities which cannot be avoided, and that only when they are faced will we become truly mature.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02408"><member>Viscount Hanworth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, this report highlights far wider long-term issues. I say "highlights" because the issues involved are highly emotional, but
<col>550</col>
they pale into relative insignificance compared with the long-term possibilities of affecting human reproduction and its genetic coding. Anyone who has looked into the immense progress which has been made in recommitant genetic engineering in the last 20 years should be impressed by what has been achieved and sceptical of dismissing future possibilities as science fiction.<lb/>
Already by these means we have been able to synthesise insulin, growth hormone and Interferon; but, much more importantly, it is theoretically possible by these means to make permanent cures for well-known blood diseases, such as sickle cell anaemia and haemophilia, by replacing defective body cells by new cells genetically engineered in a test tube. It is also possible to produce new bacteriological organisms which could be lethally effective beyond anything at present known. Just as with the matters considered in this report, each step forward can be justified by the medical benefits provided or likely to result from further research. But&#x2014;I repeat, "but"&#x2014;without doubt such future benefits will also give our society and the world abilities which cannot possibly be controlled in our very imperfect society.<lb/>
To take a simple example, the control of the sex of children will undoubtedly be possible in the not very distant future. In the Western countries this probably would not matter, but in the developing countries a male child is all-important. Looking further into the future, cloning is likely to be possible. Cloning means that any number of identical individuals can be produced. Rather further ahead is the possibility of genetically engineering the human chromosome and producing individuals with specific characteristics. This has already been done, rather fortuitously, with white mice; and some Peers may already have seen an account of this in the <i>New Scientist</i>.<lb/>
My Lords, we are on a very slippery slope, as we can see from the Warnock report. Firstly, we agreed to AIH&#x2014;that is, artificial insemination by the husband&#x2014;where there were problems with normal fertilisation with intercourse. Then there was AID, artificial insemination by a donor; then <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation by donated female eggs; and then surrogate mothers, with commercial overtones. There is no difficulty in maintaining sperm banks, and soon the same will apply to female eggs. There is, therefore, the temptation of breeding for results. Let us remember the Nazis' rather pathetic attempts to do so in a different way. Some can argue that the needs of couples, and, in particular, women who want children, should be paramount. I discount this. In my view the effect on the children so conceived is much more important, and the needs of society&#x2014;and think of China!&#x2014;are at least as important as a couple's desire for children.<lb/>
In reaching any conclusion as to what should be done ethical and religious views are important, but (dare I say it?) these views are sometimes only emotional views disguised under a more acceptable umbrella. Yes, I suppose that in the end it is what in life we think is worthwhile and important that matters. Having said all this, what are my own personal views? For several years I should have liked to prevent further research in this biological field. Clearly, this is not practical policy. Even if we did this to our commercial

<col>551</col>
disadvantage in Britain, others, elsewhere, would carry on. Science for science's sake, regardless of its consequences, still carries weight. Pragmatically, I believe that we should do all that we can to deal with what I believe is a developing menace to our civilisation as we know it today.<lb/>
It follows that in general terms I support this report and its recommendations. I do not wish to comment on the details of the report, but I would say that I do not think that it should be watered down or very much changed except where some of its recommendations may prove impractical. But personally, of course, I should like to see it tightened up a great deal more, particularly in some of the ways that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, has indicated.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02410"><member>The Lord Bishop of Norwich</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is significant that 27 of your Lordships have felt that on this last day of the Session this is a matter of such major national, social, religious and family importance that you should ask to speak. I believe it is a good thing that Her Majesty's Government have given us the opportunity of having this first, quite unhurried and serious discussion about many of these issues, so that we can begin at least to see where the vital issues within this report are to be found. I myself feel that at the stage of which we are at the moment&#x2014;when, for instance, we on these Benches have not yet discussed this matter in the General Synod or in the diocesan synods; and, anyway, from these Benches it is right that we should speak from our own convictions but state a Church view if a Church view is given&#x2014;we should remind ourselves and each other that human beings are a unique creation of God, and that the creator and giver of all life has done us the honour and given us the trust of making us human beings in His world with the responsibility for being vice-regents of His creation, as set out in the early chapters of the Genesis story. Therefore we have a major responsibility for our own world and for the human race.<lb/>
I should like to say one thing about the family aspect of the Warnock report and a second thing about the experimental and research aspect of the Warnock report. I shall begin with the family. I have tried to see why, as I read slowly through the report, I began to find myself in a situation of dis-ease about the report. I think it was first of all because I did not find any clearly defined moral principles built upon the ancient Judaeo-Christian traditions of moral principles of our nation. The light seemed to flicker back and forth. All of us were delighted to find that in relation to the chilling thought of the implanting of human ova in the uterus of an animal, in this report it was advised that that should not take place. That was a comfort. The fact that the Warnock report firmly grasped the nettle of the surrogate mother situation&#x2014;apart from a couple of the members dissenting&#x2014;again was a firm point of encouragement. The light seemed to be clear there. But otherwise there seemed to be a certain movement of moral principle throughout, and that, I think, is where I found dis-ease about it.<lb/>
I ask your Lordships, if you will, to turn to page 10, Chapter two, paragraph 2.5, as a sharp example of this
<col>552</col>
in relation to the family. It is headed "Eligibility for treatment." It reads:
<quote>"It is sometimes suggested that infertility treatment should be available only to married couples &#x2026;"</quote>
Then the report begins to be ambivalent on the family moral issue. It goes on to say:
<quote>"While we are vitally aware of the need to protect these interests&#x2014;</quote>
that is, the interests of the married couples and any child born as a result, as is mentioned earlier&#x2014;
<quote>"we are not prepared to recommend that access to treatment should be based exclusively on the legal status of marriage".</quote>
Then we begin to move off towards the view of treatment in relation not to marriage but to other areas of sexual relationships.<lb/>
Let us remind ourselves that not only in the churches of this land do we speak about marriage being a relationship of one man and one woman for life, but also in the registry offices of our country we speak of ideal marriage being of one man and one woman to the exclusion of others for life. Yet this report seems not to grasp the uncomfortable moral results of that actual English position. So it moves quite easily from AIH to AID.<lb/>
I am so glad that a number of your Lordships have referred&#x2014;and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, did so with his usual careful precision&#x2014;to the only statement of the Church of England which is still clear. This, of course, is the statement in the Archbishop of Canterbury's report on artificial insemination in 1948. There, the Archbishop himself is accepting AIH, which personally I not only accept but believe to be a most helpful way of helping all those within the nuclear family&#x2014;the mother who desires her husband's child, the husband who desires that his wife should bear his child, and the unborn child of that potential parenthood unit. Here I believe we have a great deal to thank the medical profession for as regards their research, their patience and their treatment of couples, because everyone in that particular nuclear family is thus helped and the family is held together.<lb/>
On the other hand, in 1948 the Archbishop was so highly critical of artificial insemination by donor that he recommended it should be made a criminal offence. No doubt the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church and those of the Jewish faith will be discussing this in their representative assemblies in the coming months, and in some ways I believe it is a good thing that we should have the opportunity of discussing this as individuals before there are too many clearly defined positions. But I do believe that the business of the family needs watching very carefully in this particular report. And so the report moves to AID.<lb/>
I believe, myself, that this raises major moral problems, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, has reminded us, because here a third party enters that nuclear relationship of husband and wife. Here problems arise, whether (one might say) morally, of potential adultery; or legally, of inheritance of the person concerned; or socially (because we know so much more about family relationships today), the problem of that mother knowing that she has received the life of another man who is anonymous, thus making it possible for her to bear a child, and her relationship with her husband, who knows he has not
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0285"/>
<col>553</col>
been able to help his wife in that common activity of parenthood, and the child growing up in the years to come not fully having the assurance that he is owned, loved and supported by two natural parents. It is an entirely different situation from the fostering situation.<lb/>
Those of us who either have had foster children in our homes for a period of years or have had adoption in our families know that this is a very beautiful thing. Your Lordships will know the story of the two children at school. One said, and said proudly, "I was adopted: you see, my parents chose me". That is a beautiful thing, and a right and proper thing. I think that the moral implications of AID should have been looked at very much more deeply in this report; and, if so, then obviously that which goes after it, which is egg donation and embryo donation. I shall not comment on them because they are further down this fast-moving stream.<lb/>
I will turn for a moment to the research aspect of the report, and I believe this is the moment to remind your Lordships that in the Mori poll which the Order of Christian Unity set up in July&#x2014;and nearly 2,000 people took part in it, so it represented a good cross-section of people&#x2014;there is a certain gut reaction in the nation against one or two of the more controversial recommendations of Warnock. Of those who were invited to comment on Warnock, 57 per cent. felt that surrogate motherhood should not be allowed; but 75 per cent. felt that human embryos for research should not be created for research purposes as such, and 85 per cent. felt that experiments on human embryos were not right. This is, I think, a gut reaction in the early moments of Warnock.<lb/>
I think we in our House have a duty to try to understand what fairly ordinary, run-of-the-mill people think about moral issues, because quite often they get it right. I give one example involving a letter from a woman. I will not name the hospital concerned but I could let the noble Lord the Minister have it afterwards if he so wishes. Speaking of that particular hospital, she says:
<quote>"men and women who come for sterilisation or hysterectomy operations are asked the day before if they would mind an injection and the removal of eggs for experimental purposes. It reads like the Nazi experiments".</quote>
There is something repugnant, I believe, about seeking to push forward at such speed scientific experimentation in this way at the very time the Warnock report is seeking (though I do not always feel that I agree with all their views) to find how this area of reseach can be dealt with and, to my mind, very rightly saying that we should ask the Government to set up a licensing programme which would actually monitor and take care of these things.<lb/>
However, in the light of this particular early MORI poll for the Order of Christian Unity, I believe we should press the Government for a moratorium now, because the speed of research is going so fast that I believe we are moving towards a Pandora's box which, when opened, will not be shut and the opening of which will be not just for the moral hurt but for the family hurt of many people in many families in our country.<lb/>
Therefore, I trust that the area of research will be very critically viewed by Her Majesty's Government. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, spoke in
<col>554</col>
his usual precise, steady and very compelling way when he said this afternoon that a different new living being comes at conception: the beginning of a child. He continued:
<quote>"Human life starts at the moment of conception".</quote>
Warnock argues that, but if Warnock is wrong and if human life does start at conception, then what do we make of this rather strange phrase in Warnock when it says, as though seeking to be ambivalent&#x2014;and I have great sympathy with Warnock because they have had to face the greatest possible problems&#x2014;at page 63, in paragraph 11.17:
<quote>"We recommend that the embryo of the human species should be afforded some protection in law."</quote>
That little embryo is either going to have total protection in law or "some" protection in law, which means, in effect (and I wish I could find a better phrase), that it has "had it" so far as I can see, because to offer it some protection in law when it is totally indefensible in itself is a polite way of saying that some will be finished and some allowed.<lb/>
Therefore, I simply ask Her Majesty's Government not to be afraid of facing the moral issue concerning conception, and whether conception is the beginning of a new person, as was argued so persuasively by the noble Marquess, Lord Reading. I know it is not now our custom to keep on thanking and congratulating every maiden speaker, but I break the rules and congratulate him, and apologise to your Lordships for so breaking the rules and rush on quickly before anyone actually objects. It was a great speech, and I hope we shall hear him again. I believe that his point, coming from a temporal Peer supporting the Christian view, is the greatest help to all of us. So many of us take a strongly religious view, Jewish or Christian, on these matters.<lb/>
In conclusion, I simply say that I hope the Government will consider the question of the 14-day gap as one which they should be brave enough to look at very closely, because one of the professors of gynaecology who was speaking to us in one of the committee rooms of this House last week reminded us that there are ways of doing medical research other than researching on the first 14 days of an embryo. If there are other ways&#x2014;I speak as a layman in these matters&#x2014;they should be thoroughly and energetically pursued so that we may find other ways of helping people who face fertility and health problems.<lb/>
I finish by quoting the Pope. I think that he said something very good here, and I am so broadminded that I like quoting the Pope when I agree with him. His Holiness John Paul II says:
<quote>"The world has largely lost respect for human life from the moment of conception. The world is weak in upholding the indissoluble unity of marriage. It fails to support the stability and holiness of family life. There is a crisis of truth and responsibility in human relationships. And so I support with all my heart those who recognise and defend the law of God which governs human life. We must never forget that every person, from the moment of conception to the last breath, is a unique child of God and has a right to life."</quote>
I believe that people of the Jewish faith, of the Church of England and Free Church faith, and of the Roman Catholic faith, and many thoughtful sensitive humanists searching for faith but not yet finding it, would echo those words and say to the Government, "Take especial care over the 14-day experimental period".</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02412"><member>Lord Rawlinson of Ewell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very glad to follow the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich and, as a Roman Catholic layman, may I say that I am very glad to be able to agree with everything he said. That should indicate my broadmindedness, too.<lb/>
Very rarely in the 29 years in which I have been participating in debates in both Houses of Parliament have I personally approached a subject for debate with a greater sense of foreboding&#x2014;fear for what men may be about. I find it almost beyond belief&#x2014;although I am glad that the Government have made us able to do so&#x2014;that this House has had to be called upon solemnly to debate the extraordinary matters which arise from this report. It is a sombre thought that such have been the developments in scientific knowledge, in techniques and in practices that we now debate a report about practices which will have supreme consequence to the future of the human race, and debate it at a time when we see pictures of or read about self-satisfied looking doctors announcing that they have given to a baby the heart of a baboon.<lb/>
We are now asked to consider this study by 16 brave and responsible men and women on the use of powers which must affect the whole course of future life. Because, my Lords, this is no end&#x2014;it is, of course, a beginning. For it is certain that the ability of the scientist, if permitted, to experiment with the essence of life will not stop here. It is too important a matter to be left to scientists.<lb/>
Many noble Lords&#x2014;my noble friends and noble Lords opposite&#x2014;have, as it were, congratulated the makers of this report. I confess that I find it a strange report. I find it oddly defective&#x2014;defective, as has been pointed out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, because it has not considered properly the problem of law, one of the greatest and most important matters. One would have thought that a great deal of their attention would have been turned to it. What is the position of these embryos, these future children, in law? What are their rights? What right have these men and women to experiment with the embryos? Why did they not delve deeply into this if they were to do their task properly?<lb/>
I find it also defective because it does not, as the right reverend Prelate has indicated, and as the noble Marquess, Lord Reading, in his attractive and articulate maiden speech made clear, deal with the basic moral and ethical principle. For surely the question at the heart is, "What is the nature and status of the human being?" That is the heart of the matter. Scientists are now excitedly and daily delving into the very means and manner of fashioning life itself&#x2014;the making of human beings.<lb/>
The committee in its report uses quite often the phrases "potential human being" and "potential for human life". What does that mean? In itself the phrase begs the question about the whole mystery of human life when, as again has been said by many noble Lords who have already spoken, all evidence of modern genetics ought to ensure acceptance of the principle that human life begins at fertilisation. But apparently, no, in this report. So now there is a class of life to be labelled "potential human beings", produced out of spares, spare parts, like the kit of some kind of
<col>556</col>
industrial machine, to be used in experiment for research, to be stored, to be exchanged, to be sold&#x2014;potential human beings; that is putting it in the words of the report. All this hideous process&#x2014;it is a hideous process&#x2014;is justified in the name of helping the infertile (unfortunate people, indeed, but only a percentage of the population) to achieve fertility. That is the excuse for the artificial manufacture of what will in years to come inevitably lead to a new race of human beings, the product of laboratories, that "Brave New World" about which we read 60 years ago when Aldous Huxley first conceived it in his novel. But for the time being these potential human beings who have been experimented upon are to be destroyed so that, incidentally, and ironically arising from this report, a new crime will be introduced into the criminal calendar. It is not, "Thou shalt not kill"; but "Thou shalt kill" the potential human being; and if you do not kill it you have committed a crime. That is what in this report these ladies and gentlemen are recommending. It is to such a degradation that we are carried by what I can only describe as these monstrous practices. All again, for the present&#x2014;this is the present reason&#x2014;in the name of helping infertile women.<lb/>
What is the treatment of such women? It is the implantation, as I understand it, of something cultivated elsewhere. That implantation will lead to the woman impregnated ultimately giving birth to a human child, for semen alone, as we know, cannot do that for that woman. What is implanted? What is demanded?&#x2014;nothing less than something alive, something living, which within that woman can grow until it is born, and after birth live independently of that woman. Is not that a living thing which is implanted? Of course it is; and, as it is alive, who has the right to play with it, to experiment with it, to destroy it? Who gives permission for any human being to deal with another human being in that way? Where is the law which permits this?<lb/>
The process, as I understand it, is effected by women being induced to produce several ripe eggs. They can then be fertilised artificially, leading to the embryos being frozen, stored, bought, sold and destroyed after their 14 days. They are potential living things, human rats or rabbits, the creation of "spares", but alive. And with the aim of what?&#x2014;of making the infertile fertile. Of course, infertility causes great grief and great heartache. Those who suffer it must be the object of sympathy and compassion. They have indeed a cross to bear throughout their lives which many do not have to bear. But is it good enough reason or excuse for others to play God? If society permits some of its members to treat human life in accordance with the proposals of this report, we move inexorably down a path which will lead to a monstrous society, ultimately, of fabricated creatures.<lb/>
I follow, and agree with, those who dissented in Dissent B, but I go further. I reject this report. I am revolted by its proposals, which accept embryos as useful stuff for scientists to experiment on; proposals which clothe conduct, which I believe no man is entitled to do, in the trivial commonplace language of regulation, rule, Parliamentary Order in Council; proposals which I reject, because I believe that they are an affront to the Catholic and the whole Christian concept of life.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02414"><member>The Earl of Halsbury</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in addressing your Lordships this evening, I shall take my cue from the right reverend Prelate and Father Abbot the Bishop of Norwich and break the rules by congratulating the noble Marquess on a profound and thoughtful maiden speech, with the burden of which I agree. Whether one agrees with the majority report, with one of the minorities, or rejects it <i>in toto</i>, I am sure that we should all express our gratitude to Dame Mary Warnock and her colleagues for all the hard work and study that they have put in to marshalling what facts they have been able to collect and for presenting them to Parliament and the nation in a form which is, frankly, readable and which can be comprehended by the layman.<lb/>
Since they were unable to come to a unanimous conclusion, I am sure that Dame Mary Warnock and her colleagues will not regard me as ungracious if I dissent from a number of conclusions that the majority come to, remembering that we here are not primarily moralists; we are legislators. So far as the Ten Commandments are concerned, the law has regard to only four of them. This does not invalidate the other six. It merely means that sin and crime are not closely correlated on the statute book.<lb/>
For myself, I accept the Christian ideal of marriage with the unity of the family as the keystone of the social arch. But others think differently, and the law must cater for us all, whether we are Christians who marry in church, or free-thinkers who marry in a registry office. It has to decide between us, or invent a compromise. For my own part, I accept artificial insemination by the husband as a means of avoiding infertility, and I would accept <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation by the husband if there was a guarantee that surplus embryos faced with destruction would not be produced. But that is not the case at the moment, and so there is ony one means of avoiding infertility in this sense that, for my own part, I can accept. I am profoundly mistrustful of AID and surrogacy, but the law must cater for those who disagree with me and must make its choice.<lb/>
I now want to turn to that aspect of the report which concerns me most. I am afraid it is the same aspect of it which so many of your Lordships have dealt with, but I want to present it in my own way. I refer to the status of the human embryo. I am not prepared to accept it as a potential human being. Even less am I prepared to accept it as merely a potential human being. The concept of potentiality in this context is far too broad to be of the least use.<lb/>
According to the experiments of Professor Gurdon, at Oxford, which were referred to non-attributively in Chapter 12, paragraph 14, of the report, every living cell in my body and every living cell in your Lordships' bodies is a potential human being that can result from cloning it. Its differentiation into either a liver cell or a brain cell can be reversed. It can be sent back to the totipotency of an ovum implanted into ovarian cytoplasm, and from it a new individual can be regenerated.<lb/>
If, because of that, you were to forbid experimentation with what was a potential human being, then you would have to forbid biopsy, cell culture and all sorts of harmless procedures which the
<col>558</col>
medical profession bring to our assistance. I can see no escape whatever from accepting a human embryo as a human being, a human individual, albeit in its totipotent starting position, very fragile and in need of protection in a uterine environment, but nonetheless human. There seems no alternative to that. To my mind, trying to draw a line at 14 days is quite unacceptable. You can only begin at the beginning. "What", I seem to hear someone thinking, "a pin's head of jelly a human individual? What nonsense." What is jelly?<lb/>
I ask your Lordships to imagine a living cell blown up to the size of a football. Inside that football you would find something the size of a golf ball&#x2014;the nucleus. Between the football and the golf ball would lie the cytoplasm, which contains the control process by which it differentiates and makes up its mind whether a bit of it is to be a liver cell, a muscle cell, a brain cell or whatever it may be.<lb/>
What goes on in that nucleus? It contains about five miles of the finest spider's thread you can imagine in a state of constant motion, coiling and uncoiling itself without ever getting into a knot, containing along its length the coded specifications of one unique human being unlike any other; the miraculous device by which the creator propagates his creatures from generation to generation down the endless corridors of time. A pin's head of jelly, my Lords? No, it is a miracle.<lb/>
It is from this point of view that I regard experiments on human embryos as altogether impermissible and seek a moratorium on experiments, in which I am in good company with the right reverend Prelate and others, so that we have time to think very deeply about this subject. It was for this reason that I added my name to those of other signatories to a petition to the Prime Minister asking for one. I hope we shall get it.<lb/>
May I return to the generality of the situation in which we find ourselves. Many of our troubles today spring from the headlong pace of technological progress&#x2014;and medicine, after all, is only a branch of technology, though a biological one&#x2014;outdistancing our powers of social assimilation. We are always out of our depth. This new power is just one more example. Of course, infertility is a very sad condition, but do we have to be slaves to our greed for satisfaction and our impatience? Can we not wait until we know more about it, until we have thought out the implications of what we may be doing?<lb/>
I ask your Lordships to remember the classic tragic cycle that has inspired so many playwrights and poets: <i>Koros</i>, conceit, <i>hubris</i>, the behaviour that provokes the Gods into inflicting us with <i>ate</i>, blindness to the consequences of our actions, which undoes us. Do we want to be undone? The gut feeling for what is impermissible is well illustrated in the Old Testament.
<quote>"Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind. Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed."</quote>
These examples may not be felicitous from the standpoint of plant and animal husbandry, but what is important is the feeling that they represent. It is the feeling that I have when I contemplate a human sperm penetrating a hamster ovum as a test of fertility. If that is the best we can do, let some other test be found, and let us mark time until it is.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0288"/>
<col>559</col>
If an embryo is a human being, destroying it is murder in a moral sense. Morally, abortion is murder. If it is not legally murder, it is because an Act of Parliament has enfranchised it. We should remember the New Testament criticism of Moses' permissivity over the question of divorce, "because of the hardness of men's hearts". It is because of the hardness of men's hearts and women's hearts that we have enfranchised abortion. Do not let us descend the slippery slope still further, eroding our values, weakened as they are already by the permissive society against which I have spoken so often.<lb/>
What is its legacy? May I tell your Lordships what it has given us? It has given us two new venereal diseases, both incurable and one of them fatal. Did we foresee that when we allowed the liberal humanists to tempt us down their primrose path? What else are we not foreseeing now? Think of thalidomide. Did we foresee its legacy of deformed children and of tragic babies when our women took it as a safe relief from morning sickness in pregnancy? Once bitten, twice shy. Already, many hundreds of human embryos are on ice or in liquid nitrogen. These hundreds will grow into thousands while we sit and debate about it. These embryos have nowhere to go, no means of linking their production to their chance of implantation and no future save destruction.<lb/>
Events are out-distancing this report. Only a moratorium can enable us to regain control before vested interests build up&#x2014;vested interests in services and in prestige&#x2014;and demand the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> as it now is. Your Lordships know quite well that that is a mere euphemism for creeping advance. A moratorium is what we need and a moratorium we must have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02415">5.42 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02416"><member>The Marquess of Lothian</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am very conscious of and grateful for the effort, time and work which has clearly been put by the members of Dame Mary Warnock's committee into producing a clear and informative report. I intend to be very brief; there are a great many speakers yet to be heard. Like other noble Lords, I shall confine my remarks to a single aspect of the report, the embryo.<lb/>
I was very relieved to see how many members of the committee could not countenance the manufacture of human creatures purely for the purpose of vivisection to enable research to be carried out, which in itself may not prove in future to be beneficial to other human beings. Therefore I add my support to that of all those who find creation for the purpose of destruction totally repugnant. Among these, may I briefly quote the opinion of one of the world's foremost theologians and scientists, Professor Thomas Torrance.<lb/>
Professor Torrance is a past winner of the Templeton Prize for his work on the relationship of science and morals. As many noble Lords know, he is a former Moderator of the Church of Scotland. He has recently written an assessment of morals, science and the law concerning test tube babies. I shall quote briefly what he says:
<quote>"The central issues are both scientific and moral. We are obliged to know things strictly in accordance with their natures, and to
<col>560</col>
behave towards things strictly in accordance with their natures, that is, both truly and rightly. This means that we cannot scientifically confuse science with technology and cannot morally confuse ends with means. Yet in both of these fundamental respects the Warnock Report appears to be seriously at fault".</quote>
Professor Torrance continues:
<quote>"Essential to the whole matter is the nature of the human embryo which, whatever it is, must be respected for what it is in itself and in its own right. There is no scientific doubt about the fact that from the moment of conception the human embryo is genetically complete and must be treated as such, as distinctively human, and not just as a mere biochemical episode or as equivalent to the fertilised egg of an animal or a bit of animal tissue. After all if the human embryo were neither human nor alive it would have no place in research on human beings. If the human embryo is genetically complete and distinctively human from the very beginning, then arguments allowing for scientific experiment or genetic manipulation after a certain period, seven, 14 days or whatever, are scientifically and morally specious. There is also a serious ambiguity about an argument from the premise that the embryo is 'potentially human', for the potentiality concerned is not that of becoming something else but of becoming what it essentially is".</quote>
I personally agree absolutely with that quotation. I believe it is something with which practically all religious denominations and faiths in the world would assent. That is why I strongly support the statement of dissent in the Warnock Report by four members of the committee particularly in this instance, because there were other dissenters on other matters. I refer to Mr. Baker, Professor Dyson, Mrs. Edwards and Dr. Wendy Greengross who dissented from the recommendation that research should be permitted on embryos brought into existence specifically for that purpose, or coming into existence as a result of other research.<lb/>
This in itself shows that even in the minds of the Warnock Committee there is considerable doubt about the matter. Personally, I hope that Her Majesty's Government will take the strongest notice of this point. When legislation is being considered for the future, I believe that such procedures should become a criminal offence.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02418"><member>Lady Saltoun</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I too should like to congratulate Dame Mary Warnock and her committee on their report, which is clear, well printed, sensitive and beautifully written and therefore easy to read and understand. Her letter presenting it makes clear the immense difficulties which faced the committee in inquiring dispassionately and objectively into this highly emotive subject.<lb/>
While agreeing with some of the committee's recommendations&#x2014;for example, that a statutory body should be set up and that surrogate motherhood should be virtually banned&#x2014;I have grave reservations about others. However, it is not the duty of Parliament, as I believe the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, mentioned, to order by legislation the private morals of individuals but to concern itself with protecting the defenceless. The report says:
<quote>"Questions about the distribution of resources within the world as a whole lie far outside our terms of reference".</quote>
But the allocation of resources in this country is not outwith Parliament's terms of reference. I think we have to consider how far the limited resources of the Department of Health and Social Security should be used to satisfy the very strong desire of childless couples for children, which is still a wish as opposed to a need. We have also to guard against the channelling
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0289"/>
<col>561</col>
of all available resources into the provision of AID and <i>in vitro</i> techniques, which may be unacceptable to many childless couples, at the expense of further research into the screening of abnormalities and into other methods of treating infertility and the making of those methods widely available. We must also consider that those resources are the taxpayers' money and be wary of using it for purposes which may appear to be attractive but which may have evil results in the future, or which the general public may find unacceptable.<lb/>
In Chapter 2 the report discusses eligibility for treatment, and the committee recommend that access to treatment should not be confined only to legally married couples. This seems to me quite wrong. While some unmarried couples may have a very stable relationship, most people enter into matrimony with a hope of permanency which does not so often characterise the relationship of those who merely cohabit&#x2014;and it must always be easier to part where there is not the necessity to obtain a divorce.<lb/>
Where the birth of a child is to be procured by artificial means, surely it is only right that the future welfare of that child should be subject to the gravest consideration. I should like to see treatment of whatever kind for infertility confined to legally married, childless couples&#x2014;and never under any circumstances made available to lesbian or homosexual couples, or to single people. The fact that a single person can adopt a child is neither here nor there, because in those cases the child already exists and adoption is probably the best solution from his point of view. I firmly believe that the best background for any child is to have happily married parents; it would be entirely wrong to assist artificially the birth of children into any other kind of home.<lb/>
Chapters 4 to 8 of the report are concerned with AID, egg donation, embryo donation and surrogate motherhood. I will not touch on the question of whether or not AID, egg donation or embryo donation constitutes adultery or not&#x2014;that is the business of the bishops and the Churches. My concern is about the children, on whose behalf I have serious misgivings. Recommendation 27 on page 83 states:
<quote>"In relation to egg donation the principles of good practice we have already considered in relation to other techniques should apply, including &#x2026; openness with the child about his genetic origins.".</quote>
How can one be "open" with a small child about what is, apart from anything else, a somewhat technical matter? My mind boggles at the prospect of having to explain to a six year old, say, that he was an AID child. Even if one succeeded, what then? Does one instruct him not to tell his pals? Or will he rush off and spread the news around the school playground and then get taunted by his friends? For taunted he would be&#x2014;I can almost hear the taunts.<lb/>
The committee complains of current attitudes, but one will not change attitudes by legislation. Where children have been told later on in their lives&#x2014;when teenagers or fully grown up&#x2014;some have found it very upsetting, as adopted children can do. This is one of the most serious arguments against this kind of treatment, and I really do not see how one can get around it.<lb/>
I have another reason for my concern about AID
<col>562</col>
children, etc. As the chief of a very numerous clan, it is perhaps a concern of which I am more aware than some&#x2014;although the noble Earl, Lord Lauderdale, and the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, probably have similar experience. My concern is that such children are going to lack roots&#x2014;certainly, half their roots. In the case of embryo donation children, they will lack all roots. For ever they will ask in vain, "Who was my father?" or, "Who was my mother?" or, "Who were my parents?"<lb/>
I receive many letters from Frasers&#x2014;most of them from abroad&#x2014;of which the theme is, "Can you help me trace my forebears because I want to know how I fit into the family and where I come from?" For many people, the need to know their roots is very great and really matters; it is a question of identity, and it is important psychologically. I wonder whether it is right to produce by artificial means children who will never have any hope of receiving an answer to those questions.<lb/>
Then there is the vital question of the legitimacy of the AID child. The committee recommend that the AID child should in law be treated as the legitimate child of its mother and her husband where they have both consented to the treatment. What about situations where inheritance of property, peerages or hereditary honours and positions is concerned? I am well aware that, down the centuries, many Peers have not, as one might say, been their father's sons&#x2014;but that was accidental. Should male line hereditary honours be inherited by AID children, or female line ones through the implant of an egg from another woman, then it would be deliberate&#x2014;and I do not think that would do.<lb/>
The wishes of a sovereign regarding the descent of a peerage&#x2014;or of the testator, now dead, regarding the ownership of his property&#x2014;have long been regarded by law, if not by the Inland Revenue, as sacrosanct and not to be overset so long as it was possible to honour them. I believe that this must continue to be so. Apart from anything else, it would make for very bad blood between the child and his parents and the next heirs&#x2014;in most cases, members of the family.<lb/>
All in all, for the sake of the children concerned, I believe that AID, egg donation and embryo donation should not be legal, let alone available on the National Health. To be childless when one longs for children is indeed a grave misfortune but it is not one that should be alleviated at the expense of the children for selfish reasons. I am not persuaded that the children would not be disadvantaged in some way.<lb/>
Otherwise I would say that the committee have, on the whole, dealt very fairly with the technique of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation. But in Chapter 5, paragraph 14 states that among the 215 children born at the Bourn Hall Clinic, there have been no major congenital malformations. I should like to know what malformations there have been. because I do not consider that that statement is quite good enough&#x2014;and any risk of deterioration while an embryo is <i>in vitro</i> is not good enough either. The effects of the artificial environment of the test tube on the resulting child in later life cannot be known, since the technique is in its infancy, and so are the children born by it. They are guinea pigs. I wonder whether that is right;. I do not think it is.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0290"/>
<col>563</col>
I come now to the vexed question of whether research on human embryos should be permitted at all or only up to a certain age. I do not know when the soul enters the body and I do not believe that anyone else knows, either&#x2014;although plenty believe that they do. Until we know beyond all shadow of doubt, I think that the answer must be no to all experimentation on human embryos. The noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, and others, have called for a moratorium and I would support that. I believe that legislation to that effect should be introduced as soon as possible. If we leave that door open any longer we shall never get it shut again. We will be under constant pressure to open it wider, and we will not be able to resist the pressure to do so; it will merely be a matter of time.<lb/>
And then, sooner than we realise&#x2014;because of the speed of scientific development&#x2014;we shall have experiments in inter-species breeding and genetic engineering with a view to creating a master race or a subservient race and so forth&#x2014;not to mention a growing disregard for the sanctity of human life. Tempting as it is to say the ills of this world are such that no path which could lead to the alleviation of some of them should remain untrodden, there must be some roads down which we do not go.<lb/>
The only thing I feel depressingly sure of is that we are now in a situation where, whatever we do is going to be wrong from some point of view. It is not a black and white situation&#x2014;like in the nursery, where right was right and wrong was wrong and never the twain did meet. We are dealing here with shades of grey&#x2014;and as our sight grows dimmer, it becomes more difficult to see which shade is the deeper.<lb/>
By trying to illuminate this murky subject, Dame Mary Warnock has done us a very great service. The decisions, however, are ours. We must make them, and we must not accept the Committee's views if we do not believe that they are right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02419">5.57 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02420"><member>The Earl of Lauderdale</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, despite the rules of this House, it really is impossible not to join in the congratulations which are due to the noble Marquess, Lord Reading, for his quite extraordinary and historic maiden speech. He spoke with faith; he spoke with courage; and he spoke with splendid precision. Having broken the rules, I shall now carry on.<lb/>
By any measurement this is a very remarkable report, by a very remarkable assemblage of a remarkable variety of expertise. So two cheers anyway for the Department of Health and Social Services for grasping the nettle later rather than never. But it is prudent to consider the gigantic scale and sweep of the committee's subject. It is a range of frightening possibilities in artificial human reproduction&#x2014;as scientists, unhampered by medical ethics, claim for this generation a Promethean power to determine the conditions of future human life; all this behind the mask of tackling human infertility.<lb/>
The range reaches from one extreme to another. There is the virtual manufacture of children before even birth, denied the security of identifiable parents in homes of compassion and care.<lb/>
<col>564</col>
Another extreme, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, alluded, is the possibility of genetic manipulation to breed, for example&#x2014;rather like Japanese bonzai trees&#x2014;a race of tiny persons for high altitude flying and space travel. That is not my fancy. I quote from <i>The Ethics of Genetic Control</i>, published by Joseph Fletcher in New York in 1974, at page 155. A third extreme&#x2014;because it is well to look at the extremes&#x2014;is perhaps the generation of sub-human hybrids to do the human's dirty work.<lb/>
With such a range of possibilities, was a simple departmental inquiry the right kind of body to tackle such matters, however eminent the personnel concerned&#x2014;let alone, as seemed to be suggested by my noble friend in his opening speech, to carry on and go further? On any showing this was a disparate group, seemingly unlinked by any common background of traditional philosophy or ethics beyond a general pity for the childless couple.<lb/>
When some 60 per cent. of Britain's 55 million people are baptised Christians, would it not have been prudent for the Government to consult their representatives with regard to membership of this committee? It may be that most baptised Christians go to church only two or three times in their lives: the first to be baptised, when they cannot prevent it and the next when they are buried, when they cannot prevent that, either.<lb/>
Nevertheless, there is a gut feeling of Christianity among baptised Christians which surfaces, for example, at the Cenotaph ceremony every year and on other national occasions when, rather sheepishly they bring their Christianity into the open. Even if one allows that most of the 60 per cent.&#x2014;more than 30 million&#x2014;never go inside a church except at the beginning and end of their lives, more than two million did make their Communions in the Church of England last Christmas. Were their representatives consulted? Neither the Episcopate nor the General Synod's Board of Social Responsibility was asked to put names forward for this committee.<lb/>
There are more than four million Roman Catholics in the United Kingdom. How many of those make their Communion regularly, I would not know. But there are more than four million of them. Was the hierarchy consulted? Cardinal Hume has made it quite plain that it was not. The Church of Scotland, in a country of five million people, has two million adherents. Was the Moderator or the General Assembly's Church and Nation Committee consulted? Not so. The Jewish community is, of course, much smaller. It numbers rather more than 400,000. But they have been an integral part of our nation's woof and weft since the sixteenth century. We owe them a very great deal of thanks, honour and respect for what they have given our society and our nation. Well, neither the Chief Rabbi nor the Board of Deputies, nor the Beth Din Court were consulted.<lb/>
Of course, it has been stressed in certain quarters that there was a Roman Catholic on the committee&#x2014;Professor Marshall&#x2014;but he denies that he was there as a Roman Catholic. He accepted the position on the ground of his specialist experience. It is also true that there was a Jew on the committee&#x2014;Dr. Greengross&#x2014;but the Chief Rabbi denies that that was in any sense a representative position. Indeed, there
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0291"/>
<col>565</col>
was an Anglican priest&#x2014;Professor Dyson&#x2014;but he speaks, and spoke, for no one but himself. He was not representative of the Church of England's Board of Social Responsibility. I have to say&#x2014;because truth demands it&#x2014;that there has been a slightly unpleasant whiff of deception which escaped from Whitehall when the committee membership was announced. Two leading newspapers&#x2014;<i>The Times</i> and the <i>Telegraph</i>, which are in deadly competition&#x2014;included in their account of the nomination of the committee this paragraph. It was the same in both papers:
<quote>"A team of 16 experts comprising lawyers, doctors, representatives of the Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim religions, lay people, and child care experts".</quote>
That can only have come from someone in Whitehall and I was rather surprised to notice that in opening the debate my noble friend referred to religious "interests" being on the committee. There were religious people, but they did not represent specifically any of the church organisations or interests from which they were drawn.<lb/>
This was a hand-picked committee and it did some pretty careful hand-picking in its choice of no more than 20 witnesses out of the 300 who put in statements. It chose not more than 20 to be given an oral hearing. Granted that from the list of witnesses it is evident that many of the submissions will have covered the same ground. All the same, 15 per cent. is not a high percentage for oral study of the witnesses in depth.<lb/>
The Committee took the time and trouble to visit Ulster. There its members saw witnesses from the Methodist and Presbyterian churches. They never went to Scotland. They got no nearer to evidence of the Church of Scotland's view than to confuse the Church of Scotland with the Church of England's Council for Social Responsibility. In the list of witnesses we are told that they took evidence from the Church of Scotland's Council for Social Responsibility, which does not exist. They never called one of Scotland's most notable experts in this field&#x2014;Professor Ian Donald&#x2014;the Regius Professor Emeritus of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow, let alone Professor Tom Torrance, who on any ground would claim attention, as my noble friend Lord Reading said, if only for winning the Templeton prize.<lb/>
What now? The committee has served a purpose, of course, and with diligence. It served a purpose in setting out what I call a sort of ACAS approach: "Let us get the highest common factor, never mind the morals". Both the Church of England Board of Social Responsibility, I understand, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy have reports which are due out before Christmas and which your Lordships will wish to read in due course. Anyone interested has been invited to send in their views on the Warnock report to the Department of Health and Social Security.<lb/>
I believe we now need two things. In the long term we need something more than the proposed licensing authority to monitor what goes on. Here again, I was rather alarmed to hear my noble friend the Minister refer, as I understood him, to the committee's "continued existence and activity", considering how unrepresentative it is, but I hope I misunderstood him. However, I am sure we need a continuing body to monitor the positon, but that must be either a Royal
<col>566</col>
Commission or a parliamentary Select Committee which will publish the evidence. We have no idea from the document now before us what the evidence was. The public needs to have the evidence and to study the arguments much more closely than, as I call it, the ACAS way it has been summarised in the report.<lb/>
In the short term I agree with the majority opinion in the House this afternoon that it is urgent to get the licensing authority into being, or at any rate something like it. But it must be properly representative and authoritative. To treat the Warnock Committee as a licensing authority would simply be adding one fantasy to another. The licensing authority must be authoritative and the Churches must be seen to be properly represented on it. Without that it will not command respect. Unless this body is seen to be worthily representative, I can promise my friends on the Front Bench&#x2014;they will probably be my enemies after this&#x2014;that Parliament will give it a very, very rough passage indeed in both Houses.<lb/>
The public will want some specific questions answered exactly. For example, how can we get sufficient numbers of sufficiently qualified scientific inspectors to differentiate between a 14-day and a 15-day embryo&#x2014;and we need lots of them? How are we to find enough inspectors able to spot a more than two-celled stage of hybrid breeding? The public will want proper answers to those two questions. There are widespread, and I believe well-informed, fears lest trans-species fertilisation lead beyond embryonic growth to a mixed breed, converting the uniqueness of man into a bastardised freak. The public, I believe, will revolt against debasement of human generation to stud farming methods. I believe that the public is already showing signs of an instinctive resistance to the Brave New World's intrusion into this most private and sacred area of human experience.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02421">6.12 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02422"><member>Lord Robertson of Oakridge</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am grateful to the Government for giving your Lordships' House the chance to debate the Warnock Report. There is a great deal in the report to be praised, and I should like particularly to thank the authors for the clarity with which they set out the problems and proposals. I should also like to pay tribute to those medical scientists who have developed medical techniques to relieve would-be parents of the wretched condition of infertility. The question which faces society now is how those techniques can be channelled into beneficial areas and avoid creating harmful results which could far outweigh the benefits.<lb/>
In assessing the Warnock Report against this test, I believe it to be deficient on two counts. First, it does not put sufficient weight on the importance of a stable family background. Secondly, I believe that it fails fully to appreciate the unique status and value of human life&#x2014;and may I say how much I admired the speech on that subject by the noble Marquess, Lord Reading?<lb/>
To deal first with the family aspect, the report looks forward to the spread of AID, which by its very nature introduces a third party into the marriage who provides his sperm to enable the wife to have a child; or, if it is used on unmarried women (as Warnock is prepared to permit), it produces fatherless children. It
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0292"/>
<col>567</col>
is thus one more way of increasing the already tragic number of one-parent families. Ought not our aim to be that every child should be born to a father and mother who are pledged to each other in lifelong, exclusive and permanent loyalty? The artificial insemination process should be used only between husband and wife. To do otherwise seems grossly unfair on the offspring.<lb/>
Still on my first point, the report welcomes the technique of IVF and envisages its use well beyond its help to the childless, infertile couple. I submit that IVF should be used only in rare and exceptional cases, if at all. Ideally a child should be the result of a personal loving encounter between husband and wife. As such he or she may be regarded as a gift&#x2014;a gift from God&#x2014;and valued accordingly.<lb/>
This leads me to my second point&#x2014;the value of human life. The IVF child is radically different. He or she was commanded into existence by direct human action in the laboratory. His status is therefore that of a product&#x2014;that is, something that we make and have at our disposal. Products are subject to quality control and if they fall short we can discard them. In this respect, the part of the report dealing with sex selection to me makes chilling reading. Once we allow that human beings are disposable, we are on very dangerous ground. We put at risk not only the unborn child but also the handicapped, the chronically ill and the elderly.<lb/>
It follows that we must look very closely at the fact that IVF techniques allow the production of so-called spare embryos which will never be implanted in their mother's womb. Personally, I find the thought of a genetically complete human being being considered as spare to be totally abhorrent. The report actually contemplates the conclusion that, since the embryos are spare, we may do what we like with them. We may buy and sell them, freeze them (with consequences that at this stage we cannot foresee), experiment on them, test drugs on them and finally discard them&#x2014;provided of course that all that is done in the first 14 days.<lb/>
To treat a human embryo in this way is dehumanising and therefore totally against Christian principles. As a member of the Christian Church, I worship Jesus Christ, who was incarnate by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He was a full human being from conception onwards, and both scripture and Christian tradition teach us to regard him as such. If that is the case with the representative man, such must also be the case with each one of us. For this reason I do not see that the Christian conscience can allow any treatment of an embryo that would not be acceptable if applied to the rest of the human race. It is comforting to know that according to the MORI poll carried out by the Order of Christian Unity these thoughts are shared by a majority of public opinion.<lb/>
The situation is moving ahead very swiftly. It is vital that legislation is enacted without undue delay. I hope that in that legislation the interests of the embryo child are paramount. It is on this point that I would disagree most sharply with the views expressed by the right reverend Prelate the Lord Bishop of Chelmsford who seemed to give the treatment of infertility precedence
<col>568</col>
over the interests of the embryo child. The legislation should also recognise the importance of the family background. Furthermore, as recommended in Expression of Dissent B, experimentation on the embryo should not be permitted and the embryo should be afforded special protection in law. I support those who are proposing a two-year moratorium on embryo research to prevent matters getting out of hand while legislation is being enacted.<lb/>
I end by reminding your Lordshps of the words of the psalmist on the value of humanity in God's sight. The psalmist said:</membercontribution></p>
<quote>"When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</quote>
<quote>What is man, that thou art mindful of him?</quote>
<quote>and the Son of Man, that thou visitest him?</quote>
<quote>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour".</quote>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02423"><member>Lord Ashbourne</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to begin by saying how grateful I am to the noble Lord the Minister for putting down this Motion and thereby giving your Lordships an opportunity to debate this Warnock Report. I had intended to raise the subject in the debate on the Queen's Speech but I think it much better that we should have a separate debate on such an important subject which could have a material bearing on the lives of our children for generations to come.<lb/>
Perhaps I might also apologise to the noble Lord the Minister for missing his opening speech, but I came directly from the casualty department of the Moorgate Hospital. An inconsiderate piece of grit lodged itself behind one of my eyelids, to my great discomfort. Had it not been for the great skill and speed of the doctors and nurses at that hospital I would probably have missed the whole debate. I hope the Minister will excuse the apparent discourtesy.<lb/>
It seems to me that the key factor that society has to decide is what status should be afforded the embryo. In my view, the report deals with this somewhat inadequately. Paragraph 11.17 says:
<quote>"The status of the embryo is a matter of fundamental principle which should be enshrined in legislation".</quote>
That is a weighty statement with which I entirely agree. But unfortunately the report then seems to change gear and continues, with no conviction:
<quote>"We recommend that the embryo of the human species should be afforded some protection in law".</quote>
I was interested to hear from the right reverend prelate the Bishop of Norwich, who is sitting in front of me, that that particular sentence stuck in his gullet, in the same way as it stuck in mine.<lb/>
As your Lordships are aware, life is full of indicators. These indicators often show the thinking behind the written word. Taking the report as a whole there are a few sentences depicted in heavy print and one can only presume that the members of the committee regard these sentences as pivotal to the arguments being put forward.<lb/>
On page 63 of the report we can see that what I would regard as the central issue, which is that,
<quote>"the status of the embryo is a matter of fundamental principle which should be enshrined in legislation"</quote>
is in normal print, and that the following sentence, which I would regard as of secondary importance,
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0293"/>
<col>569</col>
namely, that the embryo should be afforded some protection, is in heavy print. It is of course for your Lordships to judge in these matters, but could it be that this misuse of emphasis reflects the shallow thinking of a committee sailing through uncharted waters but determined to muddle through in spite of the hazards which abound on every side?<lb/>
I am going to mention only three of these hazards, namely, the sale of embryos, the freezing of embryos, and the experimentation with embryos for up to 14 days, although there are other matters in the report with which I profoundly disagree.<lb/>
Paragraph 13.13 advocates the sale and purchase of human embryos, provided that they comply with the rules of the licensing body, which is likely to be an independent authority to monitor what goes on in the local area; a two-tier system of central and local administration. If so, is it not a significant abandonment of parliamentary responsibility to allow a specialist body to dictate in matters of basic human rights involving the creation or destruction of human life? In truth, are we not getting perilously close to the reintroduction of the slave market if we are to permit the purchase and sale of embryos, whatever the statutory licensing authority might or might not think?<lb/>
Secondly, I am concerned about the possible long-term effects of freezing and storing an embryo. Paragraph 10.10 recommends a maximum, of 10 years for storage of embryos. If this proposal was to be supported by legislation, it would be the first time ever that a medical procedure has been made legal where there was no presumed benefit to the patient, in this case the embryo, to whom it was being done, and who continues to exist. Furthermore, we have no knowledge of what effect freezing may have on the child. Even the Warnock Committee admits to:
<quote>"the current ignorance of the possible effects of long storage".</quote>
In past times there have been a number of procedures which ultimately were found to have tragic effects. For example, children X-rayed in the womb developed leukaemia. Also some years ago women threatened with miscarriage were given oestrin; only when the children of these pregnancies reached early puberty did doctors discover that the oestrin given to the mothers had in some of these children caused cancer.<lb/>
As the noble Marquess, Lord Reading, stated in his admirable maiden speech, the report recommends:
<quote>"Legislation should provide that research may be carried out on any embryo resulting from <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, whatever its provenance, up to the end of the 14th day after fertilisation, but subject to all other restrictions as may be imposed by the licensing body".</quote>
To justify the use of a human embryo as a guinea pig, the committee suggests that it would enable the furtherance of research into inherited diseases and genetic disorders, such as Down's Syndrome.<lb/>
My Lords, this is an emotive manoeuvre aimed at gaining public support as it would be virtually impossible for any scientist to achieve verifiable results within the 14-day limit, so far as either genetic diseases or the effects of drugs are concerned. The committee's 14-day limit is both artificial and arbitrary. As Mr. Patrick Steptoe commented in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 11th October 1984:
<col>570</col>
<quote>"How can someone be a legitimate researcher for 14 days and then, one minute later, a criminal?"</quote>
Furthermore, Professor Lejeune, one of the world's leading geneticists, who discovered that Down's Syndrome was due to an error in the chromosomes, has demonstrated that work is being successfully carried out at a number of centres in different countries into genetic disorders and without the use of embryos. Furthermore, he is of the opinion that such experiments will not be required in the future.<lb/>
I have spoken for long enough and I must try to come to a balanced conclusion speedily if I am not to weary your Lordships. I would not wish the House to think that I was against the whole of the report. Indeed, I wholeheartedly support recommendations Numbers 56, 57 and 58 proposing that surrogate motherhood should be made a criminal offence. However, the report takes little heed of the solidarity of the family, the centrality of marriage, and the sanctity of human life from conception.<lb/>
New laboratory techniques are being developed almost weekly, so that early legislation is needed if clear principles are to be established for the guidance of scientists and doctors. Indeed, I understand that a two-year moratorium has been suggested to give time for the Government to decide the way forward, and I would certainly not be against this. It would be much better than stumbling into the minefield which we are otherwise in danger of doing. In view of this, I would like to end by asking the noble Lord the Minister what action the Government propose in the face of these remarkable and potentially dangerous developments.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02425"><member>Lord McNair</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, had we a Bill before us this afternoon and were this at Second Reading, I do not think I would have dared to talk about these highly technical matters. But we are only asked to take note of the Warnock Report. I hope that that opens the door wide enough to admit some observations of perhaps only peripheral relevance to the report.<lb/>
However, it would be wretchedly churlish if I did not first pay my tribute to the exceptional and oh-so-welcome readability of this report. Ever since long ago I have completely failed to study and comprehend philosophy. I have held philosophers in very high regard, and I have found it always a pleasure to listen to them or read their writings, almost regardless of the subject matter. With some exceptions, of course, their very strict mental discipline seems to endow them with a lucidity, an honesty of language, which is very refreshing. Surely, all through this report one can discern the hand of a very notable philosopher. It examines conflicting views with respect. It owns up to doubts and it says, and says clearly, what it means. Politicians, social scientists and others, please note!<lb/>
On reading the report, I was at first assailed by demographic doubts about whether infertility really is a problem in an over-populated world, to which my noble friend Lord Winstanley referred in his speech a long time ago now. However, these and other doubts are summarised in paragraph 2.3 and I find them convincingly refuted in 2.4. I do accept that infertility in women and in men is an affliction for which help should properly be given. But, nevertheless, I cannot recognise the right to have a baby as absolute.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0294"/>
<col>571</col>
This was brought home to me, and surely to many others, by a case about nine years ago which confronted several people with a peculiarly agonising dilemma. It concerned a girl in her early teens who was unlucky enough to be suffering from an incurable condition known as Soto's syndrome. This is a rare and obscure condition straight out of nature's dirty tricks department in which the victim has a severe degree of mental retardation, no hope of a mental age above eight or nine, combined with an unusual amount of sexual precocity. The inevitable outcome of this witches' brew of symptoms is not difficult to imagine.<lb/>
In this case, the poor girl's distracted mother asked the doctors&#x2014;because she recognised that she could not control or protect her daughter&#x2014;to perform an operation for sterilisation. In this request she was supported by some psychologists and/or psychiatrists. The operation was due to take place when some social workers, from a different point of view, objected. It may have been these people who took the case into the public arena. Letters appeared in the newspapers, some supporting the mother, others defending the inalienable right of every human female to have babies, and so on. The controversy was eventually settled before a judge in chambers&#x2014;the judge, incidentally, a female.<lb/>
The learned judge heard counsel for the social workers, counsel for the psychologists and counsel for the mother and found, in her wisdom, that the operation for sterilisation should not take place. I make no criticism. I was not there. But it struck me that there was one very important voice that the judge never heard. No advocate spoke&#x2014;how could he?&#x2014;for the luckless baby who would inevitably be born to this pitiable girl who could never, in any but the most strictly obstetrical sense of the word, be a mother. That voice was silent.<lb/>
From this case and from its wider implications, I formulated in my mind what I suggest ought to be regarded as a fundamental human right&#x2014;the right not to be born to a life of predictable hell. If you think of life as a game of snakes and ladders, I suggest that where one can foresee clearly that it is going to be all snakes and never a ladder in sight, then an unborn human soul has the right to say, "No thanks. I pass. I'll sit this one out and wait for a slightly brighter horoscope". This human right, which a Roman lawyer could very succinctly describe as a <i>jus non nascendi</i>, a right not to be born, seems to be as fundamental as that other human right, usually assumed to be the most fundamental of all, the right not to be unlawfully killed. Ironically, the two of them share one grim characteristic. It is this. If you have been denied either of these human rights, there is no redress. Nothing can be done; it is too late. The tragic evidence of this can be seen all too often in the files of our social services, in our subnormality hospitals, in our prisons and even on our streets.<lb/>
I am not suggesting, of course, that this human right could ever make its way into any convention or be covered by law. We have, I think, legislated for the right of an infant to sue post natally for damage sustained <i>in utero</i>, and I suspect that that is about as far back as the law can go. The only protection for this
<col>572</col>
human right not to be born when the odds are hopeless will have to be that we engrave it in our memories.<lb/>
I conclude this summary of my possibly rather lateral thinking about Warnock by restating a general principle which is perhaps more strictly relevant to the substance of the report and which is, I think, now fairly widely accepted in theory, though not always carried out in practice. I would describe this as the principle of the priority of the youngest. This means that in any human imbroglio involving people of more than one generation, the point of view of the youngest participant is almost bound to be the most important. There are at least three reasons for this: first, the youngest is least able to speak for itself; second, it is almost certainly the most innocent and the least blameworthy; and third, being the youngest, it will have the longest span of time in which to put up with the consequences of any decision.<lb/>
This is relevant to the problem of human infertility. I am far from unsympathetic to the plight of men or women who find that they cannot have the children they long for. I am fully in favour of them receiving what help the doctors and scientists can give them. But, just as no one in his senses would postulate the inalienable right of every child to have a puppy for Christmas, so I think that we have to stop short of recognising any absolute right to human procreation. We have to remember that every baby, every human embryo, is an adult in the making, a potential person, and must never be regarded as the pet or plaything or possession of its parents.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02427"><member>Viscount Sidmouth</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, in the foreword to their report, the Warnock Committee make a bow to the role of morality but conclude that
<quote>"matters of ultimate value are not susceptible of proof".</quote>
Nevertheless, at their own chosen level, they recognise the feelings expressed in the evidence and conclude that
<quote>"Barriers, it is generally agreed, must be set up",</quote>
I believe that it is convenient to consider this complex matter at that level because there is in public opinion, undoubtedly a deep-seated repugnance to IVF and all that it implies. This is fully borne out by the MORI poll commissioned by the Order of Christian Unity and carried out in July 1984, to which several noble Lords have already referred. This sound instinctive reaction should not be overruled by sentiment when it comes to considering where the legislative barriers should be placed.<lb/>
If, as the noble Marquess, Lord Reading, suggested in his admirable maiden speech, we consider the law on abortion, may I say that I believe it was the situation arising when a pregnancy threatens the life of a mother that influenced Parliament to decide in her favour, through abortion. As I understand it, serious threats to life or health of this order are relatively rare, and clearly many abortions are being authorised where, at best, the only threat is the statistically small one inherent in going full-term to normal delivery.<lb/>
In considering infertility, the committee rather questionably decided to ignore the question of whether the world really needs new and expensive methods of increased fertility and concentrates instead on the
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0295"/>
<col>573</col>
position of the relatively small number of couples who want children but cannot have them in hitherto accepted ways. No doubt there is sympathy for such people and a desire to help them by AIH, for example, or even AID, although, as several noble Lords have made clear, there would be many (of whom I most emphatically am one) who would not regard the latter as morally justified.<lb/>
But having identified this claim for what the committee call alleviating infertility, the report goes on to apply it, by extrapolation, to all the developments the committee were asked to consider&#x2014;all the way, in fact, to trans-species fertilisation. I believe that in doing so they load more on to their argument than it can bear, because this process, in all its modes, is concerned with human embryos which may be used for experiments, for freezing, for being allowed to die or simply for being killed off. There is no question here of a mother's life being weighed against such things, and gratifying the wishes of a few infertile people is certainly not a justification for them. The report itself sets out cogently enough the arguments against using embryos for experiments&#x2014;paragraphs 11.26 and 11.27&#x2014;but then goes against its own logic and accepts by a majority that this is all right for up to 14 days. I submit that the case for IVF and its developments has not been made and that this is the point at which barriers should be placed.<lb/>
To defend the lines they wish to see drawn, the committee propose to set up a licensing authority. With all the strategic passes already conceded, this body would have no chance at all of seriously influencing events. I have the good fortune to know a number of research scientists, and have no doubt that they are men of integrity. But the more dedicated they are to research the more firmly they believe that the only personal boundaries they recognise in their work are those currently limiting human knowledge itself. No doubt they would accept and conform to limitations imposed by society as a whole, preferably world-wide, but these must be clearly stated and firmly supported by law.<lb/>
Many people are reminded by the research we are considering today of that which led to the building of the atomic bomb. This is not altogether fanciful, and, indeed, the repercussions for the human race may be just as far-reaching. It is worth recalling that the decision to proceed with that research was taken in the light of survival in a world war, and few people would wish to be faced with making the right choice in such circumstances. Certain it is that if the decision was being taken today it would be different. Moreover, if concerted action had been possible at a much earlier stage the chances of achieving, for example, the zero option proposed by the United States Government would be far better.<lb/>
Once the genie is out of the bottle it is very difficult to put it back again. It is like the story of the Dutch boy who put his hand in the dyke. He is a national hero because he was present at the start of a potential disaster and had the courage and insight to take the right action at the right time. I believe that the Government should initiate legislation as soon as possible, even if it is of an interim nature, and should take all action open to them to obtain concerted action in Europe, and world-wide, to curb these dangerous and disruptive activities.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02429"><member>Lord Tranmire</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, at this stage of the debate there is a great danger of undue repetition. I just want to say to your Lordships that I am worried and troubled over this report. It is written with exceptional clarity. It deals in some detail with the medical and the legal issues, but it seems to neglect entirely the effect of the committee's recommendations on the child who is brought into the world by the techniques they recommend, and also the effect on the family in which that child is brought up.<lb/>
I know that noble Lords have already touched on this, but for me it is a very worrying thing for a young child, at the start of his life, to be uncertain as to his parents and to be in a family whose only link may well be the link of some donors' bureau in an infertility clinic. I think that is a horrible idea that comes from this report. After all, the Christian, the Jewish and the Mohammedan religions all set and regard the family as the pillar of civilisation. Destroy that, and you destroy the civilisation, as the Chinese found a few years ago when they tried to experiment with the family.<lb/>
For these reasons, I believe that it would be a grave mistake to legalise extra-marital fertilisation of embryos involving a spouse and a third party. To quote the words the report uses in another context:
<quote>"Once a foot is set on the 'slippery slope'&#x2026; no end can be set to the dangers".</quote>
That applies equally to their recommendation on AID and on IVF, provided the spouse is not involved. Therefore, I would myself confine medical treatment to surgery where that is practicable, to AIH and to IVF, provided the spermatozoa of the husband were used.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02430">I do not want to go into other detail. I agree with the great body of opinion expressed in this House about the unwisdom of the Warnock report's recommendations regarding research and experiment, and the more satisfactory alternative of the dissenting judgment B. I say just this. I hope I never live to see the day when the Seventh Commandment is amended with the addition of the words,
<quote>"unless sponsored by a panel doctor and licensed by an infertility quango".</quote></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02432"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow and agree with my old house captain, but I shall be brief. The noble Lord was president of the debating society in our school many years ago and he insisted that no speaker should hold forth for more than a few minutes. Therefore, if anybody is likely to bring me to a close, it is him.<lb/>
As the noble Lord has said, this subject has been thoroughly combed over this afternoon and that is one reason&#x2014;apart from any others&#x2014;for being brief. I should like to single out two speeches. I know that I am making a mistake here because there have been many very brilliant orators taking part in our debate. However, the maiden speech by the noble Marquess, Lord Reading, was an extraordinary <i>tour de force</i>. Of course I remember his father and his grandfather. Things are rather moving on when I remember speakers mainly by reference to their grandfathers. I
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0296"/>
<col>575</col>
did not know his great-grandfather although I might have known him because I was alive at the time, but I was not here. Anyway it was a great pleasure to hear someone from that distinguished family speaking so well.<lb/>
Although the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich is not present, I ventured in an article I wrote some years ago about the House of Lords to say that he was the most attractive speaker that had ever been thrown up by the Bishop's Bench, and I think that he fully justified that compliment in his compelling speech this afternoon.<lb/>
There is a habit nowadays of referring to reports by the name of the chairman. We talk of Beveridge, Wolfenden, or Robbins not meaning the person, but meaning their reports. I should be very sorry to have to refer to my much admired friend Dame Mary Warnock in such a way. I am afraid that I have some sharp criticisms to make of this report but they have mostly been voiced already. However, as one would expect from one of the most brilliant women of our time, perhaps the most brilliant woman I know outside my own family and of course outside this House&#x2014;I must be careful here&#x2014;and as one would expect of a Committee over which she presided, the report is highly educational and everyone must agree that it is extraordinarily lucid with the arguments not always quite fairly presented but still very clearly set out on both sides and on all points. Therefore, there is a great deal to be said for the report from that point of view.<lb/>
I agreed very much with one large part of the emphasis of the report, that is, the insistence that these new extraordinary discoveries must be very carefully regulated. Everyone, including my acting Leader, my noble friend, Lord Ennals&#x2014;who was very careful to explain that he was speaking only for himself&#x2014;would agree with the principle of regulation. That seems to be a point on which we can all come together.<lb/>
To put it quite bluntly, I am against the use of embryos for research. One might say, "You would be, wouldn't you?"&#x2014;to use a phrase made fashionable by Miss Rice-Davies many years ago. Yes, that is true. But other people would be against other things which fall in the same area. I know very well a lady whose first child was an imbecile. The child lived until the age of 10 without ever being able to recognise her mother, and then she died. Is there anyone who does not have a bias against any attempts to experiment on that child? It might be said that the child would not notice anything that was going on and that experimentation could be useful for some future purpose and that other people might be assisted in the future. But we all draw the line somewhere&#x2014;certainly Dame Mary Warnock and my noble friend Lord Ennals would draw the line&#x2014;at experimenting on a living person, a person who has actually emerged into childhood.<lb/>
The question is: do we draw the line at experimenting on these so-called embryos? On that point I really hardly need to add to what was said so very carefully and fully and with such humane and at the same time theological wisdom by the noble Marquess, Lord Reading. I need not go over that ground again.<lb/>
<col>576</col>
I personally consider that Dame Mary Warnock and her committee have put one aspect of our conviction very clearly. The Committee say in Chapter 11, paragraph 11, that the main argument is that:
<quote>"the use of human embryos for research is morally wrong because of the very fact that they are human, and much of the evidence submitted to us strongly supports this".</quote>
That is my point of view and it was my point of view before I read the Warnock Report.<lb/>
I am no scientist, but let me dwell for one moment on one point as regards which I feel that the committee has gone seriously wrong; at any rate, it has mis-stated the situation. I am referring to Chapter 11, paragraph 14 where it says:
<quote>"Those who are firmly opposed to research on human embryos recognise that a ban on their use may reduce the volume not only of pure research but also research in potentially beneficial areas".</quote>
Then it goes on to describe the areas. That really is simply not so. I am amazed that it has neglected a good deal of evidence that was submitted to it and which said exactly the opposite. I shall not stop to quote, but I shall just refer to the evidence submitted by the French scientist Professor Jerome Lejeune who is without doubt one of the world's greatest geneticists. He laid the utmost stress on the fact that this type of research conducted within our 14 days will be of very little value compared to research which can be conducted without violating, as I would say, the moral laws. So even on scientific grounds&#x2014;and in that connection I would not dream of offering my opinion as being of much value&#x2014;we must recognise that there is a great deal of highly expert opinion which is simply, on the face of it, ignored by the report.<lb/>
I am afraid that I do not share the belief of my dear friend Lord Soper that in some extraordinary way science will provide new spiritual possibilities for the family. That, I am afraid, seems to me to be altogether too optimistic. But going beyond and outside science, I say that this is an appalling prospect. It is not just a question of what the Warnock Report says; it is not just that we are shocked by what is going on now: we are profoundly apprehensive about where it could lead in the future.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02434"><member>Baroness Masham of Ilton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not want to be the only Member of your Lordships' House not to congratulate the noble Marquess on his splendid and strong maiden speech. I had not intended to speak in this debate. I had not intended to come to London this week, as I had work to do in the North. It was the importance of this debate and report, and telephone calls from concerned people, which encouraged me to say a few words. This debate with such important Christian and moral issues has, I feel, been sprung on us so suddenly and with so little time to prepare. What I say today is my first reaction to the report.<lb/>
I once watched a science fiction film about a man who was made in a laboratory. He escaped and did all kinds of terrible things. It makes me think: is this the start of something which could lead to a Hitler theory of only the perfect human beings being brought into our society? There is now a very large non-Christian population. Life to many no longer seems sacred. I blame a great deal of the present problems on the abortion of babies and on society for having let that
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0297"/>
<col>577</col>
happen. I feel that it is a pity that not more females are speaking in this debate today.<lb/>
There are many childless couples who have a profound longing to have a baby or to bring up children. Many of them in the past derived great joy from having adopted children. Now there is a shortage of babies for adoption. I believe that human life begins at fertilisation and that thereafter what is done should be done in the best interest of the living, growing human embryo.<lb/>
The Roman Catholic teaching is quite clear and I should like to quote from what the Catholic Archbishops of Britain said in January 1980.
<quote>"It is Catholic teaching, supported by modern scientific knowledge, that from the time of conception there comes into existence a new life and a process of continuous growth begins. We accept as a sacred responsibility from God the need to respect and protect&#x2014;from the time of conception&#x2014;what has begun its human life.</quote>
<quote>Each such new life is the life not of a potential human being but of a human being with potential."</quote>
The advances in medical science are great. The temptations for experimentation on the human embryo could go far. Very often scientists work in narrow specialist fields. They might try to reach their goal without any regard to the embryo. How could 14 days be controlled, and what is the difference between day 1 and day 14, except that the embryo is more advanced?<lb/>
When I was a patient at Stoke Mandeville hospital there was a Roman Catholic doctor who would ask young male patients who had broken their backs or their necks and who might like to father babies in the future if they would like some of their semen frozen while it was still active and fertile. This would later be injected into their wives. In cases like this, <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation could be of great help, as it could be to other married couples who needed help.<lb/>
I am worried about Recommendation 16 of the report which says:
<quote>"The licensing body be asked to consider the need for follow-up studies of children born as a result of the new techniques, including consideration of the need for a centrally maintained register of such births."</quote>
This would be putting the children in a special guinea-pig category. Children, whoever they are, are individuals and unless they need special protection because of child abuse, I do not think that the children would want to be specially categorised. They would want to be treated the same as other children.<lb/>
I believe that the further we get away from nature, the more problems we shall have. So far as I can gather both the report and the Church disagree with surrogate mothering; but so far as I can see in some special cases this might be in the best interests of the embryo. From a physiological point of view surrogate motherhood is very successful: a woman's womb does not usually reject an embryo from elsewhere. Many millions of children have been successfully brought up by wet nurses or nannies. This could be said to be an extension of that practice. That is just a woman's feeling as I know how protective women can be, though I appreciate that this could raise many problems.<lb/>
I expect that this debate will stimulate all sorts of discussion outside your Lordship's House, but I hope that the result will be good.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02436"><member>Lord Milverton</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, what are we doing with life in our present day? This is the vitally important question in respect of human beings, as it is to a lesser degree in respect of other aspects of creation. How we treat ourselves will determine how we treat life. Disturbing and frightening aspects are placed before us in the Warnock Committee report. This report, together with other factors of modern life, must cause many men, women, boys and girls to think deeply about values in regard to human life. We must consider life not only when the child has been born, but we must value human life from the moment of conception, thinking of the potential of each unique unborn child. We are dealing with that which has the substance of all feeling and sensitivity&#x2014;life. The material matter within our grasp and our control must never be regarded as existing for experimental and research purposes, for satisfying curiosity or human whims of any kind.<lb/>
It is said and known that all forms of life can feel. Then could it not be that a human embryo may feel right from the beginning of its existence or, as the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, suggested, that even that apparently little nothing of the egg or sperm may also feel and have sensitivity? It is some of the material of life for the creation of unique human beings who, by the grace of God, have been so privileged.<lb/>
I suggest that here lie some of the disturbing factors which we have to face at this time. For instance, in paragraphs 8.1 and 8.2 of Background Paper No. 150 surrogate motherhood may be right for some special cases, but on the whole surely it is quite inappropriate. The practice of superovulation has a strangeness, an unnaturalness, around the act. The different ways involved in donation by donors are also a door to the misuse of that which is used in the creation of life. The idea of freezing eggs and/or embryos is horrible, as is the idea that if spare embryos are not needed they can be destroyed, just chucked away, or used for research.<lb/>
Children born by AID should be made legitimate and not remain illegitimate. The use of sperm banks is also an unwholesome step. The idea of many lives arising from a licensing body and its functions leaves one cold&#x2014;dead cold. For instance, paragraph 22 of the section headed "Principles of provision" in this background paper is unnatural and cold. It reads:
<quote>"For the present, there should be a limit of ten children who can be fathered by one donor".</quote>
I think it is repulsive to ask a man to give his sperm for the creation of a child when that man will have nothing to do with that child when it comes into existence.<lb/>
Paragraph 29 is dangerous. It says:
<quote>"The use of frozen semen in artificial insemination should continue".</quote>
As I understand it, this whole business of the freezing of potential life is horrible and nasty. Paragraph 31 is dangerous and unacceptable. It reads:
<quote>"There should be a maximum of ten years for the storage of embryos after which time the right to use or disposal should pass to the storage authority."</quote>
A storage authority for what will be a human life! What are we coming to?<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0298"/>
<col>579</col>
If this is allowed to operate, some man or woman might say (as some have already thought of, and as some have already tried to do): "Let us breed the perfect human race".<lb/>
Paragraph 43 deals with legal limits on research. Is this right? I do not think so. It reads:
<quote>"Legislation should provide that research may be carried out on an embryo resulting from <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation, whatever its provenance, up to the end of the fourteenth day after fertilisation, but subject to all other restrictions as may be imposed by the licensing body."</quote>
Life coming into existence by a licensing body? True life is to come into existence by love, and we must do all possible to help that to happen. Can the law be a safeguard in something that is so uncertain and complex? The most stringent safeguards by law are necessary if these ways are to grow, but far better to check these ways to guide them to far better, practical, wholesome ways. The ugliness of monetary payment comes into play with a value being put on an embryo or surrogate motherhood or the other ways and forms. What are we coming to, with money being one of the main factors for life coming into existence?<lb/>
I hope Her Majesty's Government will take note of the Order of Christian Unity findings. I hope they will take note before formulating their view and look deeply, thoroughly and positively critically into the Warnock Committee report and at what has been said tonight, particularly by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, when he used the expression "a thing" which was mentioned in the Warnock report and also when he brought out the point of these anonymous people.<lb/>
What are we coming to? Have we lost all sense, as some people have already said, of that which makes a family? Families are not made just by a man and woman living together. A family is made by a man and woman who live together in love, giving themselves to each other in love, helping each other in smooth and rough waters and at all times. I hope that the Government will also take note of what was said by the noble Earl, Lord Halsbury, who always has something very clear, true and succulent for us. Also, last but not least&#x2014;I am afraid I did not realise that it was breaking a rule&#x2014;I hope Her Majesty's Government will take good and proper note of the excellent speech of Lord Reading.<lb/>
I agree with those who say that there ought to be a moratorium. We cannot allow what has already begun to continue without proper safeguards. I hope Her Majesty's Government will take note of those very prominent and able people who have said that there should be a moratorium. Her Majesty's Government must take note.</membercontribution></p>

Like most of your Lordships who have spoken this evening I object very strongly to the Warnock Committee report, and its recommendations, on ethical and religious grounds. I do not
<col>580</col>
intend to speak on those grounds as they have been ably covered by so many of your Lordships. I should like to highlight an objection which has been voiced by many noble Lords; that is, the 14-day period. How is one to determine the 14-day period, and who is to distinguish between 14 and 40 days? Surely that is a grave defect in a report which should give guidance on a matter such as this.<lb/>
My noble kinsman Lord Lauderdale spoke very effectively about the lack of consultation with the various religious bodies in this country. He mentioned the various Christian denominations, including the Methodists, and he mentioned the Jews. Perhaps I might remind your Lordships that there are a million and a quarter Moslems in this country, many of whom are British subjects, and to them, as to us, such experimentation is utterly abhorrent.<lb/>
There are graver implications. Your Lordships have been speaking with great effect about experimenting with embryos. Can we not expect, perhaps, that this will lead to juggling with genes? Is it not possible to envisage that in time to come people may be able to order their own children? Someone may say, "All right; I'll have two boys with blue eyes", or, "I will have two girls with golden hair". What a terrible thought! But, even worse, I saw in a paper the other day an advertisement for a gender blender. Can your Lordships imagine it? So, apart from all the horrible results of this experimentation, we may even have hermaphrodites with us.</membercontribution></p>

I hope the lawyers have all avoided the temptation to say that these problems are medical, and that the scientists have avoided the temptation to say that these problems are all legal. But there is, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, pointed out, a legal vacuum. Your Lordships' debate has shown that there is no moral vacuum. In particular, the noble Marquess, the maiden speaker, demonstrated, with his clarity of thought and expression, what many of your Lordships clearly felt. My own recent experience of the same ordeal reinforces my congratulations to him.<lb/>
We have to face the fact that science relating to infertility has raced ahead of the law. The law must catch up with the so-called reproduction revolution. Like the proverbial tortoise, it must win the race in the end.<lb/>
The Warnock report has been described by one journalist as a triumph of common sense over theology. Many of your Lordships have castigated it as, in effect, amoral. I ask your Lordships to consider whether we can hold back the tide. It would be all too easy to say that we must stop the race here, but the fact is that the race will continue elsewhere, in particular in America and Australia, where these techniques are being developed daily. It will indeed be carried on in this country, but in secret.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0299"/>
<col>581</col>
To say that infertility is a problem is not to say that there is an absolute right to parenthood. I would echo the observation of my noble friend Lord McNair on that. Most of us would prefer to see parenthood as a privilege and a responsibility. But we must recognise the powerful wish for children not only in the naturally infertile, but also in the deliberate but prematurely infertile. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford has mentioned, this is aggravated by the shortage of children available for adoption. As a practitioner in family law, I can only vaguely convey to your Lordships the desperation which can enter into a contested adoption case or a contested custody or access dispute, particularly, if I may say so, when one of the parties has been sterilised.<lb/>
But some of your Lordships have also mentioned another powerul urge and that of course must also be recognised. That is the powerful urge of the child as it enters adulthood to know its parental origins.<lb/>
My Lords, the striking observation to my mind in the early stages of the report is that people want some limit. One asks oneself why. It is, presumably, first, to prevent genetic engineering. But it is also to prevent exploitation of the basic urge for children and exploitation of and by donors. And, indeed, one has to say that it is also to protect parents from themselves, from badly thought out private arrangements which can only create distress and sometimes disaster. But it is also, as many of your Lordships have said, ultimately to protect the end product, the child, whose interests must be paramount. The report recognises that controls cannot just be legislative and negative. There must also be medical and ethical controls and also the positive provision of services to assist the infertile.<lb/>
I ask your Lordships to consider this. Excessive control, which some of your Lordships seem to favour, may well have the result of encouraging the provision of back-street services, as experience shows in another, not unrelated, area. Control requires definition and, of course??? there has to be a great deal of legal and moral line drawing. Because we are concerned with the living or the potentially living, definition has to be in terms of time, a beginning and an end. Many of your Lordships have agonised, as people do, over fixing a point at which life in the abstract begins. I hope that it is not a failure of my own intellect or my own inadequate Christian faith if I suggest that it is more helpful to consider when viability begins, rather than when life in abstract begins.<lb/>
My Lords, so much for the beginning. One looks then at the end. One has to face the fact that controlling the production and use of sperm, egg and embryo for artificial and assisted reproduction must include the power to destroy the entities created and preserved for those purposes. That does not mean that one does not care about life or human beings in the abstract. On the contrary, I suggest that it shows that we do care about the life and the quality of life of the unique individual who can be produced and, indeed, of the quality of the life of the parents or caretakers of that unique child.<lb/>
Warnock grasps the nettle and sets time limits. First of all, there is AIH, which creates no problem except when there is to be conception after the husband's death. Of course, the child is not conceived or born in
<col>582</col>
wedlock and is therefore illegitimate. The report proposes the automatic and immediate exclusion of the child for succession and inheritance purposes. I beg to question the need for that automatic and immediate exclusion. One must remember that this will have been a planned and wanted child of both parents. A great deal more thought, I would suggest, must go into <i>post mortem</i> AIH. Clearly, one wishes to discourage it simply for inheritance purposes. I venture to suggest that it should be tied in with a review of the law of illegitimacy which, as we all know, is under way.<lb/>
As to AID, I venture to suggest that the Warnock report has got it right. It suggests anonymity, time limits on the keeping of sperm, the limiting of the number of donations by any one person and, of course, restricting payments to donors&#x2014;all very necessary, though, if I may venture a note of levity, disappointing to those of us who may be looking for other gainful employment in the unhappy event of the abolition of your Lordships' House. The provision for automatic illegitimacy echoes a Bill which was introduced in another place in 1977 but, again, I would suggest that it ought to be looked at in the wider context of the law relating to legitimacy.<lb/>
Many of your Lordships have been concerned, indeed, most of your Lordships have been concerned, with how long one should allow an embryo to remain&#x2014;and I limit my observation to embryos produced for reproductive purposes&#x2014;in suspended existence. I suspect that "suspended animation" is not the correct phrase. A doctor's dilemma has been quoted. A doctor who has had much to do with a unit in a university in Australia which apparently contains some 250 embryos frozen in a tank of liquid nitrogen has asked these questions if the parents die, or they separate, or they do not want their embryos, are they the doctor's responsibility? Can ownership of an embryo be transferred? Can an embryo inherit? Can consenting parents put out an embryo for adoption? Can they request that it be thawed out and left to die? Perhaps embryos have a right to the chance of life.<lb/>
I suspect that many of your Lordships would be saying that that doctor's dilemma is of her own making. But, given that it exists, I would submit that the doctors are entitled to look to the law to provide the answers&#x2014;and by the law I mean the legislators. Otherwise, it will not be too fanciful to see an argument ancillary to a divorce case as to the custody of an embryo; and it will not be fanciful to foresee grotesque inheritance problems. Assuming that your Lordships' House survives, your Lordships' descendants may be caused considerable consternation to be confronted with a newly-defrosted elder son from some previous generation.<lb/>
My Lords, the Warnock report suggests a 10-year maximum for the preservation of embryos. I would only question the necessity or desirability of keeping them alive (to use that phrase neutrally) for so long. It was really only the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, who touched on the question of surrogacy. I think that your Lordships have all agreed that commercial arrangements must be outlawed but that private arrangements also should be discouraged. But I think that your Lordships should be aware that so-called domestic surrogacy can work well where a fertile sister provides a child for an infertile sister.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0300"/>
<col>583</col>
But, of course, it can go terribly wrong. There is one, and I think only one, case in the English law reports concerning this problem. A man married a lady who was unable to have further children. He became obsessed with the idea that he should have his own natural child, and embarked upon a plan to achieve that object. What in fact he did was to go to Bow Street Magistrates' Court, find someone who had apparently been in court for prostitution and offer her money to bear a child. She refused, but she did find a 19-year-old woman who was prepared to undertake the contract. Money changed hands and the pregnancy was commenced by artificial insemination with the man's sperm. During the pregnancy the almost inevitable happened: the woman changed her mind and decided to keep the child.<lb/>
After the child's birth, the father&#x2014;for indeed he was the father&#x2014;started wardship proceedings to obtain the custody of the baby. He failed at first instance but the judge allowed him access to that child. The case went to the Court of Appeal, whose members expressed themselves forcefully against the whole arrangement, saying that no bond between the father and the child except the mere biological bond existed, there never having been any association between the father and mother except the sordid commercial bond. It had been a wholly artificial situation from the beginning. It should never have happened and no responsible adult should have allowed it to happen. But it had happened, and the court had to pick up the pieces. The best way is to let the mother lead as normal a life as possible with the child without interference from an obsessive father, who was still passionately anxious to get care and control of the child. The result was that he was refused access to the child indefinitely.<lb/>
In the final analysis you cannot stop such arrangements: you can discourage them but you cannot stop them. If it is going to happen we have either to leave it to the courts to pick up the pieces or, as the minority in the report suggested, have some very limited regulation of such arrangements in special cases.<lb/>
As many of your Lordships have said, you cannot divorce this question from the values of society and the values of a family life. One question I ask myself&#x2014;I do not pretend to know the answer&#x2014;is this. Society requires no qualification of natural parents for natural parenthood, but it requires quite stringent qualifications for adoption even when one of the adopters is a natural parent of the child. The anxiety is the interests of the child and to avoid distortion of family relationships. We must ask ourselves, if the surrogacy arrangements are to go ahead, what qualities we require of those who seek artificial assistance and who should make the value judgments involved.<lb/>
Questions have been raised in this debate as to how representative the committee was and indeed how representative the evidence was. I happen to believe that your Lordships' House is one of the most representative forums in the country, but I do ask the Government to consider how representative are the views that have been heard today. The Warnock Report poses many questions and provides many answers. The tortoise of the law will have to tread carefully but its way has been well lit by this report.<lb/>
<col>584</col>
The law should be a tortoise and not an ostrich, burying its head.<lb/>
In closing I would simply say this. The noble Earl, Lord Longford, quoted Miss Rice-Davies and so I feel able to quote Miss Marilyn Monroe. Asked what did she think of sex? she said, "I think sex is here to stay". I think we have to face it: these techniques are here to stay.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02443"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not propose to speak on behalf of these Benches except to congratulate the noble Marquess, Lord Reading, on his distinguished and forceful contribution. I have been asked by my noble friend Lord Ennals to apologise to the House for his absence, but he is obliged to keep another appointment.<lb/>
On reading the pages of the Warnock Report, most of us find ourselves face to face with the immense advances made by scientists in very recent years, and that in a small but formative area of life. I would echo the sentiments of many Members when I say it seems to me that science is sometimes running well ahead of our capacity to perceive and think through the basic issues which it poses. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, has illustrated how science is also outstripping the law. Hence, I find myself among those who are anguished if not confused as to how we should be responding to the issues and the problems which are generated by some aspects of medical advancement.<lb/>
In recent years organ transplantation has emphasised the difficulties of defining terms such as "life" and "death" in adults and children. But in relation to the human embryo we are again faced with a question: when does life begin? I agree that this is a question which, from my own point of view, cannot easily be answered in a simple fashion. The question can be refined and further refined; and eventually I found myself asking a question asked by one of the dissenters: at what stage of development should the status of a person be accorded to an embryo of the human species?<lb/>
I do not propose to go over the ground, but, faced with that uncertainty and possibly by my own inadequate Christianity, I tend in the first place to look to my doctor for guidance, believing and hoping that his clinical judgment is tolerably sound. I agree that the issues are wider than those of medical ethics. But given my doctor's assurance, I would go along with a development in medicine if I know that it offers prospects of hope even if only to a few, and provided also that such development is acceptable to most sections of contemporary society. Those are my guidelines. They may be inadequate guidelines, but I find them helpful.<lb/>
IVF is a considerable achievement and I do not think one can overestimate its importance. Sudden infertility is a cross for some people. But I do not accept that it is a cross which must be carried to the end of life if the doctor can offer help. I believe therefore that IVF is here to stay as a new clinical treatment to enable families to have a fuller life.<lb/>
But your Lordships have spent many hours on a second question. Is it also to stay as a research tool to solve problems which are associated with infertility? I
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0301"/>
<col>585</col>
believe there are deep differences of opinion in the country surrounding the use of the human embryo for research. It is an area of great controversy and I venture to suggest that that controversy has not really been reflected in the discussion over the past few hours. It is certainly reflected in the Warnock Report which could not reach a unanimous view about the use of the human embryo for research. We know&#x2014;I shall not go over the ground&#x2014;that the minority of the committee was opposed to the embryo being the subject of research. It has to be protected from conception either because it is a human person or because it has a high potential for being a human person. I also believe that there is a strong fear&#x2014;that has emerged in the discussion this afternoon&#x2014;that research may open up future possibilities and dangerous developments. One noble Lord referred to the present stage of research as being on a slippery slope. I respect that view but there is a majority opinion within the committee which, having regard to the contribution that can be made by scientific research, then allows research on a live human embryo.<lb/>
We have not heard as much as we ought about the conditions which the Warnock Committee recommends for the research work. It is subject to two basic conditions; that it must be undertaken by practitioners or researchers licensed by the new statutory licensing authority; and that it must be undertaken on premises also licensed by the licensing authority and which are open to inspection by the authority's inspectorate. Consideration could be given to introducing additional safeguards to tighten up the control&#x2014;for example, whether the information can be obtained in any other way. But the committee is clear in its view that 14 days after fertilisation research will end. It has given its reasons for drawing the line at the end of the 14th day and I am in no position to offer a judgment on the accuracy of the line. But to conduct research on the embryo after the 14th day would be a criminal offence. I believe that this reflects the concern of the committee to protect the embryo and its anxiety about where research could lead.<lb/>
There are some who consider that the committee has been too relaxed in drawing the line at 14 days but there are practitioners and others who consider that a 14 day rule would be too restrictive in the light of future experience. I think the point must be made and must be recorded that some practitioners point to the fact which did not escape the attention of Warnock that research may be undertaken in this country, subject to certain conditions being observed, involving the pre-viable foetus at less than 140 days' gestation and which is prevented from attaining life wholly independently of the mother following termination of pregnancy. Warnock was not impressed with that precedent and recommends or suggests that any research which makes use of live embryos or foeti should be brought within the legislative framework proposed by it. The committee had to weigh the benefit of research involving the human embryo against the very real objections which have been generated. I happen to believe that it has maintained the right balance, provided that the conditions set out in the report are implemented and observed.<lb/>
I now turn to the second issue which has concerned
<col>586</col>
your Lordships, that of surrogate pregnancy. Subject to a powerful dissenting opinion, the committee recommends the creation of two criminal offences for surrogate pregnancy. Here I share the view or the reservations of the two dissenters. I believe that there is some support for the dissenters from my noble friend Lord Soper, and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. If we accept the role of the I VF donor, I find it difficult to see why there should be a fundamental objection to surrogacy, which is an extension of what has been accepted, provided it is carried on under stringent care and control. But I appreciate that there are widespread anxieties about surrogate pregnancy agencies and I believe that the public disquiet may have been influenced in part by the suggestion that improper financial transactions are involved. The risk of exploitation is not to be underestimated and that is why one agrees that the criminal law should be used to ensure that a financial consideration does no more than meet the necessary expenditure incurred by the surrogate mother.To a very small number of parents in very special or exceptional circumstances surrogacy could be the last resort, and for that reason the door should not be completely closed on it.<lb/>
The committee noted what it described as a "haphazard organisation of services for the infertile". It found the services to be unsatisfactory and recommended that each health authority should review its facilities for the investigation and treatment of infertility and indeed that consideration be given to the inclusion of plans for improving the service as part of the next round of health authority strategic plans. However we were not told what level of spending is needed to provide adequate services for the infertile.<lb/>
Here I come to another troubling question which has not been voiced during the past few hours. To give money to one area of medicine is often to withhold it from another. Therefore, where do we place IVF in our scale of priorities? What some of us cannot accept is that the NHS, already under pressure, already for example, failing to provide adequate treatment for cervical cancer, already failing to reach those most in need of it, should be further weakened in order to find the necessary expenditure. IVF illustrates very clearly the need that arises from time to time to provide additional money for the NHS to meet the demands made on it by scientific advance.<lb/>
Finally, I return to the common ground. I think it is true to say that most of us wholeheartedly agree with the committee's main recommendation that there should be a central permanent statutory body, consisting of substantial lay representation and with a lay chairman, to regulate the service and the research that is to be undertaken. I am particularly pleased that there will be a substantial lay representation on the proposed authority. That is some safeguard. The licensing authority can also draw on the experience of the ethical committee which is monitoring and regulating research of foetus material.<lb/>
I particularly wish to endorse the recommendation that the licensing authority should consider the need for follow-up studies of children born as a result of the new techniques. It may well be&#x2014;and we have no grounds for believing otherwise&#x2014;that the incidence of birth defects is not greater than normal. We have no known evidence for believing that the children will
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0302"/>
<col>587</col>
suffer in any way from the nature of their conception. However, it would be very wise to consider the need for follow-up studies, as the committee recommends. So we are, with this report, on a new frontier. We can see that the scientists are breaking new ground and outstripping the law. The report identifies many of the problems and offers some solutions, and for that reason I believe it is a sound basis for discussion which it is to be hoped will lead to adequate and early legislation.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02446">7.55 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02447"><member>Lord Glenarthur</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, when I spoke earlier, I said how much I looked forward to hearing the comments to be made this afternoon and I, for one, have not been disappointed. I have learned a great deal and I am grateful, as we all will be, to all those who have taken part in this stimulating debate for their constructive and very profound views, which of course the Government will study most carefully. It is not easy to wind-up a debate which has expressed those very profound views and, if I am unable to mention all those who have taken part, it in no way reflects upon the content of their speech; merely on the constraints of time.<lb/>
But before I respond to some of the main points that have been made, I should like to join others of your Lordships who have congratulated my noble friend Lord Reading on a really excellent maiden speech. He spoke with very great clarity and feeling about one of the most fundamental issues before us&#x2014;the nature of the human embryo&#x2014;and he referred to the sanctity of life. He posed the question: when does it begin? In many ways, the questions he posed are unanswerable, certainly to everybody's satisfaction. But my noble friend rightly holds very strong feelings and I, too, look forward with keen anticipation to hearing future interventions from him.<lb/>
In considering where to start to wind-up this debate, I thought that the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Soper, earlier on about the family were of particular importance. The noble Lord, who apologised to me because he could not be here now, with others, such as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich and the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, placed in the forefront of our minds the many contexts in which
<col>588</col>
these matters must be considered. I should like to endorse wholeheartedly what they have said about the family. Among the interests to be considered in relation to the new techniques, those of the wider family must be as central as those of the individual couples and children concerned. I can assure your Lordships that this will be a fundamental dimension in the Government's thinking about the report.<lb/>
My noble friend Lord Lauderdale, in a powerful speech, made a number of points about the composition of the inquiry. He made a number of other points, too, which I shall study most carefully. But so far as the composition is concerned, as I have already indicated, the membership reflected a wide range of lay, professional and religious interests, although my noble friend argued over my use of the word "interests".<lb/>
The range was, in fact, very broad. Apart from two gynaecologists, it included lawyers, a general practitioner, two members with experience in social work and counselling, and a theologian. While the members were not appointed solely on the basis of their religious views, they were taken into account and a range of religious backgrounds was reflected. The inquiry received evidence from all the main religious denominations in this country and it is this dimension to the work of the committee which is fundamental. I could give my noble friend even greater details about where the meetings took place, the number of submissions that were received and so on, but I shall certainly let him have them in writing.<lb/>
The proposed statutory body to license and control the provision of services for infertility and to regulate research on human embryos is, I think, the report's central recommendation. Because of this, we have asked particularly for views to be expressed on it in the course of the consultation. We shall need to consider all views very carefully before arriving at a conclusion. The Government do not dispute the need for effective control of these methods, but it is important to bear in mind that controls already exist in the guidelines issued to research workers and clinicians.<lb/>
The Medical Research Council issued guidelines for research workers in 1982, and the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists issued guidelines for clinicians in 1983. Existing activity is therefore already conducted within a very firm framework of guidance. In considering the question of control, we should remember that these first steps have already been taken.<lb/>
As evidenced by many who have spoken in this debate, and by many other people and some of the Churches, research on human embryos is abhorrent and not permissible in any circumstances. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Norwich said, a majority of the Warnock Committee felt that some use was acceptable but only in most carefully controlled circumstances. Three members of the committee did not accept that research should be allowed in any circumstances, and added an expression of dissent to the main report on this point. I respect the deeply-held views of those of your Lordships who are of this opinion, and I have listened to and noted the points which have been made very carefully indeed; but I
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0303"/>
<col>589</col>
should like for a moment to put the other side of the picture and say a little about the case for research.<lb/>
There are potential benefits of research on human embryos. They fall into two main categories: first, to increase control of human fertility, both to improve it in the infertile and to develop better methods of contraception&#x2014;a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Winstanley&#x2014;and, secondly, to detect and prevent human abnormalities. The technique of IVF in the form used and accepted today required years of research on human embryos. The success rate in terms of infants born following IVF is still low, and will remain so in the absence of further research. More research, therefore, is necessary to find the optimum conditions for fertilisation and growth of the human embryo.<lb/>
I understand also that some congenital abnormalities, such as Downs syndrome and spina bifida are thought to originate either during sperm and egg development, at fertilisation or during the early development of the embryo. From a better understanding of the circumstances in which these disorders appear it may be possible to learn how to prevent them. Research on embryos may also lead to a better understanding of the development of chromosomal abnormalities. The techniques of genetic engineering, however alarming they might be to some, may in the future allow us to correct at an early stage of embryonic development the gene abnormalities responsible for some genetically determined diseases. Work of this kind, even with embryos of other species, has not yet progressed very far, but those of us who, like myself and, I am sure, others of your Lordships, have seen some of the tragic examples of sometimes distressingly severe mental and physical handicap, might see, way into the future, some advantages. One of the very desirable outcomes of research in the realms both of embryo nutrition and of genetic engineering is that it might lead to the need for fewer therapeutic abortions to be performed because of foetal deformity detected ante-natally.<lb/>
Much has been said about the time limit on research. This is equally fundamental, and it is a difficult matter. Many sections of the public are understandably disturbed by reports of what scientists and doctors might do if there were to be no controls on the use of human embryos for research or, for that matter, for the treatment of infertility. As the report makes clear, the problem was an exceedingly difficult one for the committee to resolve, and members gave it a great deal of thought over an extended period. In the event, the committee recommended a legal limit of 14 days after which no research should be carried out on any embryo resulting from <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation.<lb/>
Whatever one's views may be, and notwithstanding the views on the sanctity of life which have been expressed, it is important that even if life in some form has begun at fertilisation, which I do not dispute for a moment, I should set aside one popularly held view: that research is now being conducted on embryos of human physical form. True, genetic programming exists for the embryo to develop into human form, but, like the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, I am in no position to judge when human life starts. However, as I understand it, the 14-day point upon which our attention is focused is well before the beginning of the
<col>590</col>
central nervous system, although the latter, which some believe to be the key to the matter, begins to appear at about 20 days. I do not want to become involved in a very difficult argument, but the point I wish to make is that the obvious external features do not appear until much later; that is, at about 56 days.<lb/>
There have been calls from some of your Lordships, which the Government note, for a moratorium on research. We appreciate the strength of feeling which lies behind those calls. We are also aware of the findings of the MORI opinion poll, to which reference has been made. I suggest, however, that a moratorium would be premature while we are still within the consultation period and while so many interests have yet to comment on the report. One also has to ask: what would happen at the end of a moratorium? I have explained some of the existing potential benefits of this research work and the controls within which researchers are working. At the moment, while noting what has been said, it is best, I believe, to leave it at that.</membercontribution></p>

My noble friend Lord Lauderdale raised another question on research: trans-species fertilisation. This matter was raised by other Members of your Lordships' House. I understand that this procedure is used in this country only as a diagnostic test at some centres which specialise in the investigation and treatment of male infertility. I understand that the only animals used in this test are hampsters, and that the embryos are not allowed to grow beyond the two-cell stage&#x2014;one of the recommendations made in the report.<lb/>
It is no surprise to me that surrogacy has aroused comment today. The noble Lord, Lord Ennals, the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, and the noble Lord, Lord Meston, raised this matter. Many of your Lordships have articulated the strong doubts which most people have about the practice. The weight of evidence presented to the committee was against the practice, although the committee certainly heard some arguments in favour of allowing it as a last resort. As the report acknowledges, surrogacy may offer the only chance for certain couples to have a child which is genetically related to one or both of them. It may be the only way in which the husband of an infertile woman can have a child. The committee were at pains to record the difficulties which the question posed, but in the end all but two members were persuaded that surrogate motherhood treatment, whether provided by agencies or individual practitioners, should not be allowed. The Government are considering the very difficult problems raised by this technique and will listen closely to all the points which will be and which have been made.<lb/>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0304"/>
<col>591</col>
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, the noble Lord, Lord Meston, and others raised the question of the legal status of a child born as a result of AID and IVF. The committee's recommendation that an AID child should be treated as the legitimate child of its mother and her husband where they have both consented to treatment follows the recommendation of the English Law Commission in its report <i>Family Law Illegitimacy</i>, which was published in December 1982. The committee further recommended, which again follows the Law Commission's view, that it should be presumed that the husband has consented to AID unless the contrary is proved. If the recommendations of the committee and of the Law Commission are put into effect, the only ground on which the husband could challenge the operation of the provision would be that he had not consented to his wife receiving AID treatment.<lb/>
The committee's other recommendations covering the position of children born as a result of egg donation and embryo donation follow the recommendations about the AID child. It is essential that the interests of the child born as a result of these procedures should be borne in mind just as much, perhaps, as those of the parents. We believe it is very much in the child's interests that the stigma of illegitimacy should be removed. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Denning, gave us much to think about, not only in respect of the present state of the law in relation to the matters under consideration, but also the social implications of the new techniques. We must bear those wise words of warning in mind in arriving at our decisions on the report.<lb/>
We have also been reminded today by the noble and learned Lord, and by others, of the legal position relating to the ownership of embryos. The report states more than once that this is a very complex and difficult matter. Unlike the noble and learned Lord, I am no expert on the subject, but I understand that an embryo is not, in the present state of the law, a person. I gather, however, that there has not been a case in which a court has had to consider whether there can be property in an embryo. This confirms the importance of highlighting this matter as one for close consideration.<lb/>
The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and others, raised the point of telling children resulting from AID and IVF techniques about their conception. Artificial insemination is not new and although I understand the noble Lady's point of view, we are not aware of any-specific difficulties in relation to such children. I understand that in relation to adoption it is considered desirable that the adoptive parents tell their children as early as possible that they were adopted. I have to tell the noble Lady, though she may not agree with me, that there is some evidence that when younger children are informed they do not regard themselves as abnormal; in fact, I gather that they may feel special rather than strange. I have no direct experience of this, but I understand it to be the case.<lb/>
The noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, and the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, raised the question of National Health Service provision and how far it was going towards providing this technique. The committee considered the argument that the desire to have

children is only a wish and not a need and that wishes should not be satisfied at the expense of other, more urgent demands on resources. Despite this, the report concluded that infertility is a condition meriting treatment. Many of the recommendations which followed were based on that premise.<lb/>
When the committee looked at relative priorities, they recommended some reorganisation of existing services which need not, in their words, necessarily involve much greater expenditure in the longer term. I do not propose to follow the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, down the avenue he opened up to me when he spoke purely about cash and resources in the way that he did. But while we expect the authorities to meet the pressures placed upon them and improve services using these resources, it is important that they are left to determine priorities. The provision of infertility services within the National Health Service reflects locally-assessed priorities and local determination of need.<lb/>
The report also said that more information should be obtained about the scale of provision. That is quite right. We need to be clear about the level of need involved; a level which is complicated by rapid developments in this field (highlighted by many of your Lordships this afternoon) which can quickly promote expectations which could not have been possible only a few years ago. We shall be discussing with health authorities the considerations which flow from the report's recommendations on service provision and organisation.<lb/>
There have been several calls from your Lordships for early legislation to implement the recommendations in the report. Some who have spoken consider such legislation to be a matter of urgency. As I indicated at the outset, it is not my purpose today to announce the Government's intentions in relation to the report. We are still in the consultation period, and there is much to consider. I should only like to reiterate that the Government are already considering the recommendations of the Warnock report, including those requiring legislation, very closely. We shall take full account of all the points that have been made.<lb/>
Before concluding, whatever individuals may feel about the work they undertake, I should like to pay tribute to the achievements of the clinicians and researchers in this field. It would be regrettable if the deeply-held moral and religious convictions and the integrity&#x2014;as was mentioned by the noble Viscount, Lord Sidmouth&#x2014;of the scientists engaged in such exacting research was not acknowledged, I have seen some of their fascinating work at first hand and should like to record the high esteem in which I hold it. I should like to say, too, how reassured I was by the ready explanations given to me. I am sure there are others who would echo that sentiment.<lb/>
The inquiry has considered a range of complicated and difficult issues and the Government are aware that a great deal of public concern remains, particularly about research on human embryos. The Government's duty is to allay that concern as far as possible. I hope I have emphasised adequately the importance which the Government attach to considering the committee's recommendations, and
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0305"/>
<col>593</col>
the views of the organisations and bodies who have an interest in the issues, with the greatest possible care.<lb/>
The starting point for the committee's work was not only the new techniques to alleviate infertility, but also the problems and heartaches which many childless couples face&#x2014;the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, referred to the cross they have to bear&#x2014;in their desire to complete their family unit. For those who long for children the realisation that they are unable to found a family can be shattering. The report offers a basis for moving some way towards fulfilment of their hopes, with safeguards for the child, with caution, and within tolerances which society can accept.</membercontribution></p>

(Change in Status of Greenland) Order 1984</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02451">8.16 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02452"><member>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Young)</member> rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 22nd October be approved. [<i>38th Report from the Joint Committee</i>.]</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02453">The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I beg to move that the draft order be approved. I should like to draw the attention of your Lordships to the treaty which is referred to in the schedule to the order. The purpose of the treaty is to give effect to Greenland's wish to make the transition from membership of the Community&#x2014;as a part of Denmark&#x2014;to association with it. The treaty does this by removing Greenland from the scope of application of those provisions of the EEC treaty which apply to the European territory of members of the Community in general.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02454">The EEC treaty is amended by the inclusion of Greenland within its Part IV, relating to the association of overseas countries and territories within the Community. In addition, the new treaty removes Greenland from the geographical scope of the treaties establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02455">Annexed to the treaty is a protocol, which provides for duty-free access to the community for fish and fishing products coming form Greenland in return for satisfactory arrangements for access by the Community to Greenland's fishing zones. Arrangements were also agreed between Greenland and the Community to provide for a framework fisheries agreement. This established principles governing Community fishing in Greenland waters, with a protocol setting the initial quotas for Community fishermen for the first five years.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02456">The Community's fishing opportunities under the agreement are to be balanced by the annual payment to Greenland from the Community budget of 26.5 million ecu&#x2014;about &#x00A3;15 million. Greenland will not, however, receive aid from the European Development Fund by virtue of her overseas countries and territories status during the validity of the fisheries protocol.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02457">There is also provision for procedures under which the Community may act in the event of the overall agreement being disturbed. The regulations providing
<col>594</col>
for these arrangements are not listed in the schedule to the order, but it is nevertheless right to mention them your Lordships, as they are intended to form one package with the treaty and protocol. The draft texts making up the complete package were submitted to the scrutiny of the Select Committee on European legislation in another place on 24th February 1984. I shall have more to say about the fisheries arrangements later. The protocol to the treaty provides also for the application to Greenland of the Community's detailed arrangements on tariff treatment and other matters for the OCTs in relation to products covered by both the EEC and the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02458">Your Lordships will be aware that the effect of the order is that the treaty with attached protocol will be able to operate in the law of this country in accordance with their provisions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02459">It may be helpful to your Lordships if I briefly describe the background to Greenland's desire for a change in status. Greenland, though geographically distinct from the continent of Europe, was at the time of Denmark's entry into the Community fully integrated with the Kingdom of Denmark, of which it was and is a part. It was therefore obliged to join the Community with the rest of Denmark, though 60 per cent. of the Greenland population voted against membership in the referendum in which Denmark voted to accept membership. In 1979, however, there came an important change in Greenland's relationship with the rest of Denmark. She received a substantial degree of home rule, and in elections in 1979 the Greenland party opposed to EC membership won a majority.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02460">Fisheries are Greenland's major economic activity, accounting for half of her exports. The Greenlanders have always seen disadvantages in the application of the Community's fisheries policy for which, as a territory remote from other member states and with relatively little industry or agriculture, they saw few compensating advantages. In a referendum on the membership issue in February 1982, Greenland opted for withdrawal by a small majority and sought associated status under the Community's arrangements for OCTs.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02461">In May 1982 the Danish Government therefore submitted a memorandum to the Council of Ministers proposing that Greenland should cease to be within the geographical scope of the treaties establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and European Economic Community and be added to the list of OCTs in Annex IV to the EEC treaty. But as the treaties contain no provision for the withdrawal of a member state, or a part of one, the precise terms of Greenland's change in status had to be negotiated within the Community in order to provide appropriate amendments to the treaties. In the course of negotiations it was also agreed that Greenland should cease to be within the geographical scope of the treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. After discussion in the Council on a request from Denmark the treaty referred to in the schedule to the order was signed in Brussels on 13th March 1984, subject to ratification.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02462">The treaty is to come into force on 1 st January 1985 if all member states have ratified it by then. Otherwise
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0306"/>
<col>595</col>
it will come into force one month after the last state has ratified. Subject to the views of this House, we expect to have completed the necessary procedures for ratification by 1st January 1985 deadline.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02463">Before I conclude, I should say a brief word to your Lordships about the agreement on fisheries to which I referred earlier. The agreement, which was laid before the House on 14th August, has several interlocking elements intended to balance the interests of Greenland and those of the Community. For its part, Greenland will continue to benefit from duty free access to the Community market for fish and fishery products in return for her commitment to the fisheries agreement with the Community. Under the protocol to the agreement, taking into account catches by Greenland vessels, the basic quotas set for Community fishermen for the first five years represent an overall level virtually equivalent to the quotas set by the Council of Fisheries Ministers for all the major Greenland fish stocks.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02464">It is important to note that the Community is not being asked to alter its current fishing opportunities significantly. Any major reduction in current Community fishing efforts at Greenland would have led to claims for compensation from Community fishermen elsewhere in Community waters, and could have upset the entire balance of the common fisheries policy&#x2014;established with such difficulty only last year. This has been avoided and the quotas between member states, including the United Kingdom, will be allocated in accordance with the normal procedures and criteria.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02465">All in all, the Community's fishing opportunities in west and east Greenland waters, including those quotas which may be allocated to Norwegian and Faroese vessels under the relevant reciprocal fisheries agreements, amount to some 100,000 tonnes of cod equivalent&#x2014;mainly cod, red fish, Greenland halibut and shrimps. These opportunities are balanced by the annual payment to Greenland to which I referred earlier. The Community's fishing rights in Greenland waters will not, however, end at the beginning of 1995. Although the agreement is concluded for 10 years, there is provision for successive six-year periods, thus providing a solid basis on which Community and Greenland fishermen can plan for the future.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02466">I hope I have given sufficient general explanation of the background to the order and its objective for the order to commend itself to your Lordships as representing a fair and balanced deal for the Community and for this country. I beg to move.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02467">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 22nd October be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Baroness Young</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02468"><member>Lord Elwyn-Jones</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for steering us through the complex field of the withdrawal of a part-time member state from the European Community. On the face of it, from one point of view, this would seem a portentous event because, after all, Greenland is the second largest island in the world, representing half the land mass of the EC. However, with the assistance of my noble friend and of <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i> I discovered that in 1976 its
<col>596</col>
population was 49,666; so that introduces a certain sense of proportion to the gravity, significance and importance of this debate.<lb/>
The Greenlanders are admirable people. They have, in their wisdom or unwisdom, decided upon withdrawal from the EC and acceptance of an associate status. We wish them every prosperity in the consequence which will flow from the general acceptance of these orders. There are obvious legal difficulties in withdrawing from the EC, but this exercise will have taught the lawyers a good deal. I have no points of technical criticism to make. We welcome the decision of the Greenlanders and wish them good fortune in their future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02469"><member>Lord Diamond</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I, too, want to thank the noble Baroness for having fully explained the matter. It is an important matter. The population is small, but the principle is not as small. Indeed, the principle is quite large. We on these Benches hear with regret the departure of any member from the Community and we regret the departure of Greenland. We are grateful to the noble Baroness and we understand a good deal of what has happened.<lb/>
There is only one question I want to ask and that deals with fisheries, which seem to be the main point of contention. Am I right in understanding that the rights of British fishermen are unaffected?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02470"><member>Baroness Young</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Elwyn-Jones, for his welcome to this order. The negotiations with Greenland were long and far from easy, coinciding as they did with the closing stages of the Community's negotiations on a common fisheries policy. But we believe that this order is fair.<lb/>
The noble Lord, Lord Diamond, said that he regretted that any country should wish to withdraw from the Community. He is right to say that it raises an important principle. But I am happy to confirm that we believe that the rights of British fishermen have been safeguarded. It is a complex matter, coming as it does at the same time as the negotiation of the common fisheries policy, but we believe that the rights of British fishermen and the rights of Community fishermen, as well as the rights of the Greenlanders, have been safeguarded by the proposals contained in this order.</membercontribution></p>

<title>General Consumer Council(Northern Ireland) Order 1984</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02472">8.29 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02473"><member>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Lord Lyell)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move that the Draft General Consumer Council (Northern Ireland) Order 1984, a draft of which was laid before your Lordships on 22nd October this year be approved.<lb/>
The purpose of the order before us this evening is to provide more effective consumer protection for the people of Northern Ireland. Hitherto, consumer protection has been divided in the main between two
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0307"/>
<col>597</col>
statutory bodies&#x2014;the Northern Ireland Electricity Consumers Council and the Northern Ireland Transport Users' Committee and one non-statutory body&#x2014;the Northern Ireland Consumer Council. The non-statutory Northern Ireland Consumer Council advises Government on consumer protection matters, carries out and publishes research and maintains links with other United Kingdom consumer bodies, including the National Consumer Council. The statutory Northern Ireland Electricity Consumers Council has played an active role both in assisting people with complaints and in considering and in making recommendations on any matter affecting the distribution of electricity&#x2014;including charges&#x2014;and the provision of new and improved services. The last of the trio, the statutory Northern Ireland Transport Users' Committee, deals with road and rail services and facilities provided at airports.<lb/>
This order replaces a previous proposal for a draft order which was withdrawn in February 1983 after misgivings were expressed in three main areas: first, that electricity consumers would have less effective protection, particularly in relation to individual complaints; secondly, that the proposed budget of about &#x00A3;118,000 then available to the existing bodies, and which it was proposed to transfer to the new body, would be insufficient for the new body to fulfil the necessary functions; and, thirdly, that any consumer council must have a clear power to deal with individual complaints. The proposal was considered by the Northern Ireland Assemby, where these misgivings were fully aired, and resulted in the Assembly refusing to "take note".<lb/>
In the face of such substantial reservations the then Secretary of State, my right honourable friend, withdrew the proposal and asked the then Minister of State, my honourable friend Mr. Adam Butler, to examine how best the matter might be taken forward. Mr. Butler's examination resulted in the formation of an independent advisory group of experts with the following terms of reference:
<quote>"To review the arrangements for consumer protection in Northern Ireland currently provided by the Northern Ireland Consumer Council, the Northern Ireland Electricity Consumers Council and the Northern Ireland Transport Users' Committee, having regard to (a) the principle that overall, consumers in Northern Ireland should enjoy no less a standard of consumer protection than consumers in other parts of the United Kingdom; (b) the special interest of consumers of the services provided by monopoly public utilities (but not the Post Office); (c) the desirability of devising a system which, having regard to the scale of Northern Ireland, will fill any gaps in the existing arrangements and provide a consumer protection service which is cost-effective, economical, comprehensive and well co-ordinated and to make recommendations".</quote>
The group reported in September 1983 and its report, together with a discussion paper prepared by the Department of Economic Development, was published on 19th October 1983. They were subsequently considered by the Northern Ireland Assembly and were, together with the Assembly's recommendations placed in the Library of your Lordships' House on 16th January 1984. The response of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was placed in the Library on 9th April 1984.<lb/>
The order before us today is based almost entirely upon the recommendations of the independent
<col>598</col>
advisory group and those of the Northern Ireland Assembly, whose Economic Development Committee met with consumer interests in the Province. Meetings were also held with representatives of the Northern Ireland Members in another place, whose views were, we understood, in harmony with the recommendations.<lb/>
I briefly turn now to the detail of the order. As your Lordships will see, it is not lengthy, extending only to eight articles and three schedules. It seeks to replace the three existing consumer protection bodies: the Northern Ireland Consumer Council, the Northern Ireland Electricity Consumers Council and the Northern Ireland Transport Users' Committee by a single General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland. Article 1 provides that the order shall be brought into operation in two stages to enable the council to be appointed in December 1984 and to engage its staff and acquire premises so that business can commence on 1st April 1985, when the order will become fully operative. Articles 3 to 7 provide for the establishment of the General Consumer Council and set out its functions. It is made clear that the council will have the power to deal with individual complaints where this is appropriate or where other avenues of redress have failed. Its research and education role is stressed and its function in relation to transport, electricity and agricultural marketing schemes made under the Agricultural Marketing (Northern Ireland) Order 1892 are clearly set down.<lb/>
Your Lordships will recollect that during the debate in this House on the Agricultural Marketing (Northern Ireland) Order on 22nd July 1982, my noble friend Lord Gowrie said that that order made no provision for the formation and role of a consumer committee to report on the effects of any scheme on consumer interests, but that it was intended that that role would be undertaken by an amalgamated consumer protection body looking after all consumer interests in Northern Ireland. The order enables the proposed new council to fulfil this important function.<lb/>
Provision is also made for the abolition of the Northern Ireland Electricity Consumers Council and the Northern Ireland Transport Users' Committee, whose powers and duties are subsumed into the new council. Article 8 deals with repeals and amendments and repeals are listed in Schedules 2 and 3. Arrangements are made in Schedule 1 for the appointment of a chairman, deputy chairman and members to the council and for the ordering of its business, the employment of staff, acquisition of premises,. provision of funding and accountability.<lb/>
One of the main points of difficulty with the 1982 proposal for a draft order was the feeling that the &#x00A3;118,000 provided was inadequate. To meet the expenses arising from the present proposals a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;200,000 has been allocated. I am sure that your Lordships will agree with me that this considerably larger sum provides a sound financial base for the council; indeed it is rather more proportionately than the amount received by comparable consumer protection bodies in Great Britain; but against this the Northern Ireland General Consumer Council will have responsibilities which are in Great Britain exercised by the nationalised
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0308"/>
<col>599</col>
industries' consumer councils, and there is some leeway to be made up.<lb/>
The council will be required to establish four mandatory groups to exercise particular responsibility and report to the council in relation to transport, food, electricity and energy (other than electricity). There will be cross-membership between the electricity and energy groups. It is also empowered to establish such other non-mandatory groups as it considers necessary. The council will have power to co-opt to these groups persons with relevant expertise. Such persons will not have voting powers, nor will their number exceed the number of council members in any group, thus ensuring that control of its affairs remains with the council yet giving it access to specialised knowledge and advice. The Department of Economic Development proposes to take power to make subordinate legislation, subject, of course, to negative resolution, to reduce, after consultation with the council, the number of mandatory groups, should the council consider this to be necessary.<lb/>
In commending this order to your Lordships I would emphasise that it is the result of very protracted consultation and consideration and is firmly based on the recommendations of an expert independent advisory group, whose recommendations have been endorsed by the Northern Ireland Assembly and in the main by those interested in consumer protection in the Province. The Government feel that it will ensure that consumers in Northern Ireland have the safeguards which we would all wish should be given to them and that it should provide a sound base upon which to build for the future. I beg to move.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02474">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 22nd October be approved.&#x2014;(<i>Lord Lyell</i>.)</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02475">8.40 p.m.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02476"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I wish to thank the noble Lord the Minister for explaining the order to the House. We feel sure that it will be a significant contribution to consumer protection in Northern Ireland, and for that reason we are delighted to support it. My understanding is that the consumer in Northern Ireland has historically been disadvantaged and that, indeed, up to recent times and up to today, there are great areas of important interest in the Province where the voice of the consumer is silent. But all that will change. The independent advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Colin Campbell reviewed the position, concluded that the kind of criticism to which I have referred was justified, and recommended a thoroughgoing reform and. in particular, the setting up of a single organisation, the General Consumer Council, to represent consumer interest in Northern Ireland and to be funded by the Government.<lb/>
I have not come across a single word of opposition to this basic recommendation. We are therefore very glad that the Government have gone down the road recommended by the advisory group. The order which is before the House tonight will establish the single permanent statutory body. Its remit will be wide, and it will be funded by the Government. I am particularly pleased to note that the funding will be of the order of &#x00A3;200,000 a year. I had heard with some disappointment that it might be of a lower order.<lb/>
<col>600</col>
We are attracted by the idea of the General Consumer Council distributing its work between the specialist groups that will look after special areas of importance. As the Minister explained, there will be four mandatory groups. The remit of that relating to transport will, I understand, include the facilities for passengers travelling to and from Northern Ireland. Then there will be groups for electricity, energy and food. We believe that the department was probably correct in setting up the two separate groups for electricity and energy, although there has been a view that they should be merged in one group. We note the special arrangement in Article 7 in relation to the agricultural marketing schemes. We hope and trust that the arrangement will work well in practice.<lb/>
So, while giving the order our full and wholehearted support, I would ask the Minister four questions. I believe that he has answered my first question. How does this level of spending of &#x00A3;200,000 compare with expenditure incurred by the Welsh and Scottish consumer councils? I am almost certain that he explained that it compared favourably. Secondly, at what rate will members' allowances and expenses for attending meetings of the council and attending its group meetings be paid? Will there be parity with the allowance paid to the members of the Welsh and Scottish councils? Thirdly, we understand that housing is an area of great importance in Northern Ireland. Indeed, Professor Campbell described it as being one of the areas of (and I quote his words) "priority concern". I would be interested to know why the Secretary of State decided against setting up a mandatory specialist group for this subject.<lb/>
My final question is this. As experience may show to the Government that there is a need to increase the number of mandatory groups, should not the order contain power for the Secretary of State, after consultation with the council, to increase their number? Certainly the order gives the Secretary of State the power to reduce the number. I wonder whether he should also have incorporated the power to increase the number. With those few questions, we give the order our full support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02477"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, your Lordships will be grateful for the attention and careful interest that has been taken by the noble Lord in examining this order. It is, we believe, very important. It is detailed, and it is not immediately easy to understand. I pay tribute therefore to the noble Lord for the study that he has undertaken. I thank him for his comments. He is correct. The order is indeed comprehensive.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked me four questions. He did mention one of the groups, the transport group, and he referred&#x2014;I hope that I have quoted him correctly&#x2014;to passengers travelling to and from Northern Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02478"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02479"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I understand that this is indeed so for passengers travelling by sea so far as the port of Great Britain is concerned. I asked this question myself this morning. Whether this includes the Isle of Man, I am not sure. But, anyway, it relates to those travelling by boat. So far as air travel is
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0309"/>
<col>601</col>
concerned, the transport group will cover facilities at the airport. But I understand that once the passengers are on the aircraft this becomes a matter for the air users' consumer council which will be familiar to the noble Baroness, Lady Burton, from whom we hear so much. I understand that the transport group will cover only air passengers while they are at the airport in Northern Ireland.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked me four detailed and brief questions, to which I hope I can give him satisfactory answers this evening. I understand that the expenditure that we propose of the sum of up to &#x00A3;200,000 is rather more in comparative terms than the expenditure for both the Scottish and Welsh consumer councils. Of course, the noble Lord will bear in mind the remarks that I made that the Northern Ireland General Consumer Council will also be dealing with one or two points that might not be dealt with on a strictly comparable basis. Nevertheless, it is, in comparison, larger and more generous than in Scotland and in Wales.<lb/>
Secondly, members' fees and allowances will be in parity with the allowances for members of the Scottish and Welsh councils.<lb/>
The noble Lord asked about housing. I understand that the council is empowered and may set up a non-mandatory group if it feels that this is necessary. But, of course, the noble Lord will be aware that there are other avenues available to groups in Northern Ireland to speak to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and my honourable friend in another place. Fourthly, the noble Lord asked whether the council has power to increase groups. Indeed, it does have power to increase its groups should it feel the necessity for this&#x2014;does the noble Lord wish to intervene?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02480"><member>Lord Prys-Davies</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was wondering whether the Secretary of State himself, after consultation with the council, could increase the number of mandatory groups.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02481"><member>Lord Lyell</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, my winged messenger advises me that this is entirely up to the council. I understand that the mechanics are set out in the schedule. But this will always be done in consultation with the Secretary of State or the relevant Minister. I am advised that this is entirely up to the council.<lb/>
I am very grateful for the detail with which the noble Lord has examined this order. I am sure your Lordships would not wish me to detain the House further this evening. I am very grateful for the attention that has been paid by the House to this order, and I commend it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>Prorogation: Her Majesty's Speech</title>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02502">Her Majesty's most gracious Speech was then delivered to both Houses of Parliament by the Lord Chancellor (in pursuance of Her Majesty's Command) as follows:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02503">"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02504">"The Duke of Edinburgh and I were pleased to receive the State Visits of His Highness the Amir of Bahrain in April and the President of the French Republic and Madame Mitterrand last week.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02505">"We look back with much pleasure to the visits we have made over the past year. As Head of the Commonwealth I was in New Delhi on the occasion of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in November. We paid State Visits to Kenya, Bangladesh and India in November and Jordan in March. Our thoughts are with the people of India today following the tragedy of Mrs. Gandhi's assassination. We visited France in June, to attend the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of D-Day. We were in Canada in September and October for the bicentenary celebrations of New Brunswick and Ontario, and to visit Manitoba.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02506">"My Government welcomed the independence of Saint Christopher and Nevis, Brunei's resumption of full responsibility for its own external relations, and the decision of both countries to join the Commonwealth.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02507">"My Government have sustained Britain's contribution to Western defence, playing an active part in the Atlantic Alliance. They welcomed Lord Carrington's appointment as its Secretary-General. In the absence of an arms control agreement, my Government fulfilled their undertaking to begin the deployment of cruise missiles by the end of 1983.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02508">"My Government, with the United Kingdom's allies, have worked vigorously for balanced and
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0310"/>
<col>603</col>
verifiable arms control and disarmament and have sought to improve relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. They fully supported the United States' efforts to achieve nuclear arms reductions and their readiness to resume the negotiations suspended by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02509">"My Government agreed with other Member States on a fair sharing of the European Community's budget burden and on control of Community spending. They have made proposals for new Community policies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02510">"My Government were hosts to the London Economic Summit in June and welcome its conclusions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02511">"My Government have continued fully to discharge their obligations to the people of the Falkland Islands, while seeking more normal relations between this country and Argentina. They have conducted talks with China on the future of Hong Kong and published the text of a draft agreement. They have been helping with the conversion of the Royal Navy Dockyard in Gibraltar to commercial operation.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02512">"My Government have continued to support efforts to restore the independent and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and to settle the tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq. They have welcomed moves to reduce tension in Southern Africa, and continue to support peaceful change there and the early independence of Namibia. They supported United Nations efforts to settle the Cyprus question.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02513">"Members of the House of Commons,</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02514">"I thank you for the provision which you have made for the honour and dignity of the Crown and for the public services.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02515">"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02516">"My Government have maintained the policies necessary to reduce inflation and sustain economic recovery. Inflation remains low and the output of the nation continues to increase. Steps have been taken to increase incentives and to improve the climate for enterprise, the creation of wealth, and adaptability and efficiency in industry and commerce. Measures have been taken to help the unemployed into jobs, to launch a comprehensive foundation training scheme for young people starting working life, and to improve vocational education and adult training.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02517">"In order to promote economic efficiency and growth, my Government have continued their policies of exposing state-owned businesses to competition and returning them to the private sector where appropriate. Legislation has been passed to end British Telecom's exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems, to establish arrangements for the licensing and regulation of telecommunications systems, and to prepare the way for the sale of British Telecom's shares. An Act has been passed to enable the introduction of private finance into the Royal Ordnance Factories. The disposal of oil assets of the British Gas Corporation has been successfully completed.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02518">"Legislation has been passed to provide for
<col>604</col>
reforms in the tax system, especially for companies, in the interest of greater efficiency, to encourage the further development of United Kingdom oil and gas resources by abolishing royalties for certain new fields, and to provide a framework for the development of cable programme services and direct broadcasting by satellite. An Act has been passed to ensure continued funding for the Cooperative Development Agency and to introduce a new scheme of Regional Development grants.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02519">"Legislation has been passed to give trade union members greater democratic control over their unions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02520">"An Act has been passed to protect ratepayers by limiting rate increases by high-spending local authorities, and to provide reserve powers for general limitation of rates. Legislation has been passed making interim arrangements for the Greater London Council and the metropolitan county councils pending a decision by Parliament on the abolition of those authorities.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02521">"Acts have been passed to extend the right of public sector tenants to buy their homes, to reform the system of building control in England and Wales, and to assist purchases of public sector houses which have proved to be defective. Legislation has been passed to make more farming tenancies available in England and Wales, and to make other improvements in the law relating to agricultural tenancies.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02522">"An Act has been passed transferring control of London Transport from the Greater London Council to the Government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02523">"Legislation has been passed to modernise and clarify the law of England and Wales governing the investigation of crime and evidence in criminal proceedings, to strengthen the ties between the police and the community there and to extend powers to prevent acts of terrorism and to increase safegards for people subject to such powers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02524">"An Act has been passed to introduce important new safegards for individuals about whom information is held on computers.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02525">"Legislation has been passed to improve family law and its administration in England Wales, to clarify the liability of occupiers of premises to persons other than their visitors and to amend the law concerning limitation of actions.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02526">"My Government has continued to work for higher standards in education, announcing proposals on the school curriculum, examinations and increasing the influence of parents over their children's schooling. Legislation has been passed to enable grants to be paid to local education authorities in England and Wales for improvements and innovations.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02527">"Legislation has been passed to replace non-contributory invalidity pensions with a severe disablement allowance. My Government has also embarked on a series of fundamental reviews of the social security system, seeking to ensure that this large programme operates effectively and in ways suited to present day needs.</p>
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0311"/>
<col>605</col>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02528">"My Government has taken further action to ensure that patients receive the best value for money spent on the National Health Service.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02529">"My Government has encouraged Northern Ireland's elected representatives to seek arrangements, acceptable across the community, whereby responsibilities can be returned to local administration. A high priority had been given to the maintenance of law and order and support for the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02530">"For Scotland, measures have been passed to extend the right of public sector tenants, and to improve the legislation governing rating and valuation, promotion of tourism overseas, roads and inshore fisheries.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02531">"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may attend you."</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02532">After which the Lord Chancellor said:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02533">My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, by virtue of Her Majesty's Commission which has been now read we do in Her Majesty's name, and in obedience to Her Majesty's Commands, prorogue this Parliament to the 6th day of November 1984, to be then here holden, and this Parliament is accordingly prorogued to Tuesday, the 6th day of November 1984.</p>

<title>PRISON INDUSTRIES AND FARMS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02535"><member>Baroness Lane-Fox</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02536">Whether they have made any changes in the arrangements for the management of prison industries and farms.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02537"><member>The Minister of State, Home Office (Lord Elton)</member>:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02538">Yes. We have made a number of significant changes in the control, management and policies of prison service industries and farms. The emphasis in these changes, some of which are already under way, is on integrating prison industries more fully with the prison service, of which they are part, and on improving their financial and managerial performance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02539">New machinery for central management will consist of a board under the chairmanship of the Director of Regimes and Services and will include representatives of the operational arm of the service&#x2014;prison governors, as well as those responsible at headquarters for the central direction of industrial and farming activity. Two external board members will also be appointed. Day-to-day responsibility will rest with the director of what, in future, will be called "Prison Service Industries and Farms". The trade name "Prindus" will no longer be used.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02540">Future strategy and overall financial targets will be determined in a rolling four-year plan. This will take
<col>606</col>
into account such issues as the outcome of marketing reviews, developments in prison regimes and information on the projected size and distribution of the prison population. A fresh assessment of the market for prison-made goods is concentrating on the products made for use by the prison service and other pubic sector markets. Computerisation in key areas will help to strengthen financial controls.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02541">Prison industries represent one way in which the prisoner can help to offset the cost of his imprisonment and at the same time benefit from work experience. The prison service has an obligation to ensure it makes the best use of all its resources. These changes will help to further that aim.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02542"><member>Lord Hylton</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02543">When the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984 comes into force, what discussions will they have held or be planning to hold with other governments about the provisions of the Act; and, in particular, whether conversations have begun with the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02544"><member>Lord Elton</member>: We hope to be able to bring the Act into force at around the end of this year. We are in touch with the Governments of Thailand and Peru about the possibility of bilaterial agreements with those countries for the repatriation of prisoners. The Republic of Ireland is a fellow member of the Council of Europe, which has already drawn up a Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This convention, when it comes into force, will provide for transfers between states who become parties to it. We have had no separate discussions with the Republic on the matter.</p>

<title>BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL: BADGERS</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02545"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02546">Whether they are now taking stock of present measures to control bovine tuberculosis after pursuing a policy of slaughter of both cattle and badgers and whether any less crude and more scientific method of control than killing the patients is in prospect.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02547"><member>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Lord Belstead)</member>: My right honourable friend announced on 20th September that a review of the Government's policy on badgers and bovine tuberculosis was to be undertaken. The review team, chaired by Professor G. M. Dunnet, has been given the following terms of reference:
<quote>"To conduct an overall review of the problem of dealing with badgers infected with bovine tuberculosis in so far as it affects the eradication of the disease in cattle, taking into account changes in the field and research work since Lord Zuckerman reported on the problem in 1980".</quote></p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02548">The review team's findings will be made public.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02549"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02550">What has been the outcome of the investigation
<image src="S5LV0456P0I0312"/>
<col>607</col>
into the discovery of cases of bovine tuberculosis near Eastbourne; how many badgers have been destroyed; whether this is an isolated outbreak in Sussex; and what is the present position regarding trapping and destruction of badgers in this area.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02551"><member>Lord Belstead</member>: Forty-eight badgers, including one road traffic casualty, were taken during the control operation near Eastbourne earlier this year. Of these, 11 badgers (23 per cent.) were found to be infected with bovine tuberculosis at <i>post mortem</i>. The Government are considering what further steps to take in order to remove this focus of infection. There has been no confirmed incident of bovine tuberculosis in cattle elsewhere in Sussex since 1980.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02552"><member>Lord Houghton of Sowerby</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02553">What is the extent of present activity to control bovine tuberculosis through the systematic killing of badgers in particular areas; whether gassing has completely stopped; in what areas badgers are presently being exterminated; and what is the number of badgers killed so far by trapping for testing and destruction.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02554"><member>Lord Belstead</member>: As my right honourable friend's predecessor made clear in his statement to the Consultative Panel on Badgers and Tuberculosis on 1st July 1982, all gassing operations ceased with effect from 26th June 1982. Badger control operations are currently being undertaken in a number of areas in the South-West, one area of Sussex, two areas in Wales and a very small area in Staffordshire. A total of 2,494 badgers have been trapped in official operations between mid-1982 and the end of August this year. Of these, 276 (11&#x00B7;1 per cent.) have been found to be infected with bovine tuberculosis. Over a similar period (1st January 1982&#x2013;31st August 1984) 4,208 badgers killed in road traffic accidents or reported dead by members of the public have been examined by my department. Only 70 of these (1&#x00B7;7 per cent.) were found to be infected with the disease.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02557"><member>Lord Belstead</member>: The Farm Animal Welfare Council submitted their report on the welfare of red meat animals at the time of slaughter to Agriculture Ministers in June. We immediately asked interested organisations for their comments. In the light of the comments we received the Government will prepare proposals for action on the report, which we will issue for further comment.

The future of Mendip Hospital will form part of these discussions. The authorities are aiming to agree a clear strategy for inclusion in their 10-year strategic plans which are to be submitted to the department by 31st March 1985. The Somerset Health Authority is ensuring that the interests of the staff at Mendip are taken into account in the process.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02584">Whether they have studied the Briefing Paper of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, concerning the special problems of transport for young people, called <i>Going Nowhere Fast: Young People and Transport;</i> and what their response is.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02585"><member>Lord Brabazon of Tara</member>: I congratulate the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services on its interesting and carefully prepared report on the special problems of transport for young people.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02586">Some of the recommendations are more for local than central government.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02587">However, as far as central Government is concerned, the report perhaps takes insufficient account of the Government's proposals to introduce greater freedom and competition into the provision of local bus services, which, as the report rightly stresses, are important to many young people. The Government are confident that these proposals will enable and encourage the bus industry to respond to the needs of all bus users, particulary those members of the community who do not have ready access to a car, which of course includes many young people. I draw the noble Lord's attention especially to the Government's proposals for a transitional grant for rural services, comencing at &#x00A3;20 million per year, and to the fund to finance innovation in rural services. The report mentions the expense of taxis, and it is therefore to be hoped that young people will also benefit from the Government's proposals for the sharing of taxis and hire cars at separate fares.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02588">The Government believe that these measures, with their emphasis on value for money and provision for local needs will do much to meet the problems of local travel faced by young people, to which this report has usefully drawn attention.</p>

<title>ROYAL ARTILLERY MEMORIAL</title>
<body>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02599"><member>Lord Chelwood</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02600">Why the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner, honouring nearly 80,000 gunners who lost their lives in the two world wars, has been allowed to sink into such a serious state of disrepair; what plans there now are for its restoration; and when the work will be completed, at approximately what cost.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02601"><member>The Earl of Avon</member>: The Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner has been maintained regularly since it was erected in 1925. As a result of a fracture in the drainage system causing the holding down bolts to rust, the supports to the bronze statue of the shell carrier broke away earlier this year. Remedial action is being taken, costing some &#x00A3;2,000, and the repaired statue will be returned to its place shortly. In addition, the effect of the elements on the soft Portland stone, which forms the main part of the memorial, has made some cleaning and recutting necessary. This will cost about &#x00A3;30.000 and the department hopes to undertake the work next year.</p>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02604"><member>The Earl of Avon</member>: Total expenditure on deficit and operating grants to the NCB, social grants, pneumoconiosis compensation grants and the Redundant Mineworkers Payments Scheme in the 10 years from 1st July 1974 to 30th June 1984 was &#x00A3;3.5 billion. This is equivalent to &#x00A3;2.96 per tonne of coal produced in this period. The figures on which this total is based are set out in the table below:</p>

<title>WAR WIDOWS: VISITS TO HUSBANDS' GRAVES</title>

<p id="S5LV0456P0-02614"><member>Baroness Jeger</member> asked Her Majesty's Government:</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02615">What guidelines have been prepared for the Royal British Legion in its allocation of the Government grant of &#x00A3; 150,000 to enable war widows to visit their husband's graves; and what right of appeal will be available to widows refused assistance.</p>
<p id="S5LV0456P0-02616"><member>Lord Trefgarne</member>: Those guidelines which have been issued to the Royal British Legion refer to the need to provide for as many widows as possible in the scheme: war widows who have subsequently remarried and those who have previously visited their husbands graves at their own expense will, for instance, be eligible for inclusion in the scheme. They also cover questions of detailed accounting arrangements for the grant-in-aid. We do not expect any widow who has not previously received government assistance to visit her husband's grave, to be precluded from the scheme as a result of the general guidelines attached to the grant-in-aid. The inclusion of a widow in the scheme will depend very much of course on the practicable considerations attached to arranging a trip to the location of her husband's grave. The Royal British Legion will be responsible for the scheme, including the selection of those who are to make visits, making the detailed arrangements and dealing with inquiries.</p>
